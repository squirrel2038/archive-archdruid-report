<div class=MsoNormal>
Last week, after a great deal of debate, the passengers aboard the <i>Titanic</i> voted to impose modest limits sometime soon on the rate at which water is pouring into the doomed ship’s hull. Despite the torrents of self-congratulatory rhetoric currently flooding into the media from the White House and an assortment of groups on the domesticated end of the environmental movement, that’s the sum of what happened at the COP-21 conference in Paris. It’s a spectacle worth observing, and not only for those of us who are connoisseurs of irony; the factors that drove COP-21 to the latest round of nonsolutions are among the most potent forces shoving industrial civilization on its one-way trip to history’s compost bin. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The core issues up for debate at the Paris meeting were the same that have been rehashed endlessly at previous climate conferences. The consequences of continuing to treat the atmosphere as a gaseous sewer for humanity’s pollutants are becoming increasingly hard to ignore, but nearly everything that defines a modern industrial economy as “modern” and “industrial” produces greenhouse gases, and the continued growth of the world’s modern industrial economies remains the keystone of economic policy around the world. The goal pursued by negotiators at this and previous climate conferences, then, is to find some way to do something about anthropogenic global warming that won’t place any kind of restrictions on economic growth. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What that means in practice is that the world’s nations have more or less committed themselves to limit the rate at which the dumping of greenhouse gases will increase over the next fifteen years. I’d encourage those of my readers who think anything important was accomplished at the Paris conference to read that sentence again, and think about what it implies. The agreement that came out of COP-21 doesn’t commit anybody to stop dumping carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, now or at any point in the future. It doesn’t even commit anybody to set a fixed annual output that will not be exceeded. It simply commits the world’s nations to slow down the rate at which they’re increasing their dumping of greenhouse gases. If this doesn’t sound to you like a recipe for saving the world, let’s just say you’re not alone. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It wasn’t exactly encouraging that the immediate aftermath of the COP-21 agreement was a feeding frenzy among those industries most likely to profit from modest cuts in greenhouse gas consumption—yes, those would be the renewable-energy and nuclear industries, with some efforts to get scraps from the table by proponents of “clean coal,” geoengineering, fusion-power research, and a few other subsidy dumpsters of the same sort. Naomi Oreskes, a writer for whom I used to have a certain degree of respect, published <a href=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/16/new-form-climate-denialism-dont-celebrate-yet-cop-21>a crassly manipulative screed</a> insisting that anybody who questioned the claim that renewable-energy technologies could keep industrial society powered forever was engaged in, ahem, “a new form of climate denialism.” She was more than matched, to be fair, by a chorus of meretricious shills for the nuclear industry, who were just as quick to insist that renewables couldn’t be scaled up fast enough and nuclear power was the only alternative. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The shills in question are quite correct, as it happens, that renewable energy can’t be scaled up fast enough to replace fossil fuels; they could have said with equal truth that renewable energy can’t be scaled up far enough to accomplish that daunting task. The little detail they’re evading is that nuclear power can’t be scaled up far enough or fast enough, either. What’s more, however great they look on paper or PowerPoint, neither nuclear power nor grid-scale renewable power are economically viable in the real world. The evidence for this is as simple as it is conclusive: no nation anywhere on the planet has managed either one without vast and continuing government subsidies. Lacking those, neither one makes enough economic sense to be worth building, because neither one can provide the kind of cheap abundant electrical power that makes a modern industrial society possible. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Say this in the kind of company that takes global climate change seriously, of course, and if you aren’t simply shouted down by those present—and of course this is the most common response—you can expect to hear someone say, “Well, <i>something</i> has to do it.” Right there you can see the lethal blindness that pervades nearly all contemporary debates about the future, because it’s simply not true that something has to do it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>No divine providence nor any law of nature guarantees that human beings must have access to as much cheap abundant electricity as they happen to want. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Stated thus baldly, that may seem like common sense, but that sort of sense is far from common these days, even—or especially—among those people who think they’re grappling with the hard realities of the future. Here’s a useful example. One of this blog’s readers—tip of the archdruidical hat to Antroposcen—made an elegant short film that was shown at a climate-themed film festival in Paris while the COP-21 meeting was slouching toward its pointless end. The film is titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIzL6sgKKBg">A Message from the Past</a>, and as the title suggests, it portrays an incident from a future on the far side of global climate change. I encourage my readers to click through and watch it now; it’s only a few minutes long, and its point will be perfectly clear to any regular reader of this blog.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The audience at the film festival, though, found it incomprehensible. The nearest they came to making sense of it was to guess that, despite the title, it was about a message from our time that had somehow found its way to the distant past. The thought that the future on the far side of global climate change might have some resemblance to the preindustrial past—that people in that future, in the wake of the immense collective catastrophes our actions are busy creating for them, might wear handmade clothing of primitive cut and find surviving scraps of our technologies baffling relics of a bygone time—seems to have been wholly beyond the grasp of their imaginations.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Two factors make this blindness to an entire spectrum of probable futures astonishing. The first is that not that long ago, plenty of people in the climate change activism scene were talking openly about the possibility that uncontrolled climate change could stomp industrial society with the inevitability of a boot descending on an eggshell. I’m thinking here, among other examples, of the much-repeated claim by James Lovelock a few years back that the likely outcome of global climate change, if nothing was done, was heat so severe that the only human survivors a few centuries from now would be “a few hundred breeding pairs” huddled around the shores of the Arctic Ocean. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It used to be all the rage in climate change literature to go on at length about the ghastly future that would be ours if global temperatures warmed far enough to trigger serious methane releases from northern permafrost, tip one or more of the planet’s remaining ice sheets into rapid collapse, and send sea water rising to drown low-lying regions. Lurid scenarios of civilizational collapse and mass dieoff appeared in book after lavishly marketed book. Of late, though, that entire theme seems to have dropped out of the collective imagination of the activist community, to be replaced by strident claims that everything will be just fine if we ignore the hard lessons of the last thirty years of attempted renewable-energy buildouts and fling every available dollar, euro, yuan, etc. into subsidies for an even more grandiose wave of uneconomical renewable-energy powerplants. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The second factor is even more remarkable, and it’s the existence of that first factor that makes it so. Those methane releases, rising seas, and collapsing ice sheets? They’re no longer confined to the pages of remaindered global warming books. They’re happening in the real world, right now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Methane releases? Check out the <a href=http://www.nature.com/news/mysterious-siberian-crater-attributed-to-methane-1.15649>massive craters blown out of Siberian permafrost</a> in the last few years by huge methane burps, or the way the Arctic Ocean fizzes every summer like a freshly poured soda as underwater methane deposits get destabilized by rising temperatures. Methane isn’t the world-wrecking ultrapollutant that a certain class of apocalyptic fantasy likes to imagine, mostly because it doesn’t last long in the atmosphere—the average lifespan of a methane molecule once it seeps out of the permafrost is about ten years—but while it’s there, it traps heat much more effectively than carbon dioxide. The Arctic is already warming far more drastically than any other region of the planet, and the nice thick blanket of methane with which it’s wrapped itself is an important part of the reason why. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those methane releases make a great example of the sudden stop that overtook discussions of the harsh future ahead of us, once that future started to arrive. Before they began to occur, methane releases played a huge role in climate change literature—Mark Lynas’ colorful and heavily marketed book <i>Six Degrees</i> is only one of many examples. Once the methane releases actually got under way, as I noted in <a href=../../2012/04/seascape-with-methane-plumes.html>a post here some years ago</a>, most activists abruptly stopped talking about it, and references to methane on the doomward end of the blogosphere started fielding dismissive comments by climate-change mavens insisting that methane doesn’t matter and carbon dioxide is the thing to watch. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Rising seas? You can watch that in action in low-lying coastal regions anywhere in the world, but for a convenient close-up, pay a visit to <a href=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/12/21/the-siege-of-miami>Miami Beach, Florida</a>. You’ll want to do that quickly, though, while it’s still there. Sea levels off Florida have been rising about an inch a year, and southern Florida, Miami Beach included, is built on porous limestone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These days, as a result, whenever an unusually high tide combines with a strong onshore wind, salt water comes bubbling up from the storm sewers and seeping right out of the ground, and the streets of Miami Beach end up hubcap-deep in it. Further inland, <a href=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/3/19/1372031/-The-phenomenon-that-can-not-be-spoken-in-Florida-continues-as-salt-water-intrusion-moves-inland>seawater is infiltrating the aquifer from which southern Florida gets drinking water</a>, and killing plants in low-lying areas near the coast. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The situation in southern Florida gets some press, but I suspect this is because Florida is a red state and the state government’s frantic denial that global warming is happening makes an easy target for humor. The same phenomenon is happening at varying paces elsewhere in the world, as a combination of thermal expansion of warming seawater, runoff from melting glaciers, and a grab-bag of local and regional oceanographic phenomena boosts sea level well above its historic place. Nothing significant is being done about it—to be fair, it’s unlikely that anything significant can be done about it at this point, short of a total moratorium on greenhouse gas generation, and the COP-21 talks made it painfully clear that that’s not going to happen. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Instead, southern Florida faces a fate that’s going to be all too familiar to many millions of people elsewhere in the world over the years ahead. As fresh water runs short and farm and orchard crops die from salt poisoning, <a href=http://www.weather.com/news/climate/news/south-florida-sea-level-rise-mass-exodus>mass migration will be the order of the day</a>. Over the short term, southern Florida will gradually turn into salt marsh; look further into the future, and you can see Florida’s ultimate destiny, as a region of shoals, reefs, and islets extending well out into the Gulf of Mexico, with the corroded ruins of skyscrapers rising from the sea here and there as a reminder of the fading past. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Does this sound like science fiction? It’s the inescapable consequence of changes that are already under way. Even if COP-21 had produced an agreement that mattered—say, a binding commitment on the part of all the world’s nations to cut greenhouse gas emissions immediately and lower them to zero by 2030—southern Florida would still be doomed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The processes that are driving sea levels up can’t turn on a dime; just as it took more than a century of unrestricted atmospheric pollution to begin the flooding of southern Florida, it would take a long time and a great deal of hard work to reverse that, even if the political will was available. As it is, the agreement signed in Paris simply means that the flooding will continue unchecked. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A far more dramatic series of events, meanwhile, is getting under way far north of Florida. Yes, that’s <a href=http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/27/world/greenland-is-melting-away.html>the breakup of the Greenland ice sheet</a>. During the last few summers, as unprecedented warmth gripped the Arctic, rivers of meltwater have begun flowing across Greenland’s glacial surface, plunging into a growing network of chasms and tunnels that riddle the ice sheet like the holes in Swiss cheese. This is new; discussions of Greenland’s ice sheet from as little as five years ago didn’t mention the meltwater rivers at all, much less the hollowing out of the ice. Equally new is the fact that the vast majority of that meltwater isn’t flowing into the ocean—scientists have checked that, using every tool at their disposal up to and including legions of yellow rubber ducks tossed into meltwater streams. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What all this means is that in the decades immediately ahead of us, in all likelihood, we’ll get to see a spectacle no human being has seen since the end of the last ice age: the catastrophic breakup of a major ice sheet. If you got taught in school, as so many American schoolchildren were, that the great glacial sheets of the ice age melted at an imperceptible pace, think again; glaciologists disproved that decades ago. What happens, instead, is a series of sudden collapses that kick the pace of melting into overdrive at unpredictable intervals. What paleoclimatologists call <a href=http://www.livescience.com/45926-antarctica-past-melting-sea-level-rise.html>global meltwater pulses</a>—sudden surges of ice and water from collapsing ice sheets—send sea levels soaring by several meters, drowning large tracts of land in an impressively short time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Ice sheet collapses happen in a variety of ways, and Greenland is very well positioned to enact one of the better documented processes. The vast weight of all that ice pressing down on the crust through the millennia has turned the land beneath the ice into a shallow bowl surrounded by mountains—and that shallow bowl is where all the meltwater is going. Eventually the water will rise high enough to find an outlet to the sea, and when it does, it will begin to flow out—and it will take much of the ice with it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As that happens, seismographs across the North Atlantic basin will go crazy as Greenland’s ice sheet, tormented beyond endurance by the conflict between gravity and buoyancy, begins to break apart. A first great meltwater surged will vomit anything up to thousands of cubic miles of ice into the ocean. Huge icebergs will drift east and then south on the currents, and release more water as they melt. After that, summer after summer, the process will repeat itself, until some fraction of Greenland’s total ice sheet has been dumped into the ocean. How large a fraction? That’s impossible to know in advance, but all other things being equal, the more greenhouse gases get dumped into the atmosphere, the faster and more complete Greenland’s breakup will be. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Oh, and did I mention that <a href=http://www.livescience.com/45534-west-antarctica-collapse-starts.html>the West Antarctic ice sheet is beginning to break up as well</a>? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The thing to keep in mind here is that the coming global meltwater pulse will have consequences all over the world. Once it happens—and again, the processes that will lead to that event are already well under way, and nothing the world’s industrial nations are willing to do can stop it—it will simply be a matter of time before the statistically inevitable combination of high tides and stormwinds sends sea water flooding into New York City’s subway system and the vast network of underground tunnels that houses much of the city’s infrastructure. Every other coastal city in the world will wait for its own number to come up. No doubt we’ll hear plenty of talk about building vast new flood defenses to keep back the rising waters, but let us please be real; any such project would require years of lead time and almost unimaginable amounts of money, and no nation anywhere in the world is showing the least interest in doing the thing now, when it might still be an option. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s a profound irony, in other words, in all the rhetoric from Paris about balancing concerns about the climate with the supposed need for perpetual economic growth. Imagine for a moment just how the coming global meltwater pulse will impact the world economy. Countless trillions of dollars in coastal infrastructure around the world will become “sunk costs” in more than a metaphorical sense; millions of people in low-lying areas such as southern Florida will have to relocate as their homes become uninhabitable, and trillions of dollars of real estate will have its value drop to zero. A galaxy of costs for which nobody is planning will have to be met out of government and business revenue streams that have been hammered by the direct and indirect effects of worldwide coastal flooding. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What’s more, it won’t be a single event, over and done with in a few weeks or months or years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Every year for decades or centuries to come, more ice and meltwater will go sluicing into the oceans, more coastal cities and regions will face that one seawater surge too many, more costs will have to be met out of what’s left of a global economy that’s running out of functioning deepwater ports among many other things. The result, as I’ve noted in <a href=../../2014/08/dark-age-america-rising-oceans.html>previous posts here</a>, will be the disintegration of everything that counts as business as usual, and the opening phases of the bleak new reality that Frank Landis has sketched out in his harrowing new book <a href=https://heteromeles.wordpress.com/2015/11/12/its-here-sorta/ >Hot Earth Dreams</a>—the best currently available book on what the world will look like in the wake of severe climate change, and thus inevitably ignored by everyone in the current environmental mainstream.(You can read the first five chapters of Landis' book <a href=https://heteromeles.wordpress.com/2015/11/03/hot-earth-dreams-sample/ >here</a>.)</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
By the time COP-21’s attendees convened in Paris, it was probably already too late to keep global climate change from spinning completely out of control. The embarrassingly feeble agreement that came out of that event, though, has guaranteed that nothing significant will be done. The hard political and economic realities that made any actual cut in greenhouse gas emissions all but unthinkable are just layers of icing on the cake, part of the predicament of our time—a predicament that defines the words “too little, too late” as our basic approach to the future looming up ahead of us. </div>

Given the hysteresis in the climate system we are already committed to nearly 1.5 degrees rise even if we stopped emitting now.<br><br>However you can't write off renewables so easily. Renewables will not replace fossil fuels completely and even with increased efficiencies we can't afford our current industrial standard of living without oil. However technology is not going away. Electrified cities and transport systems will still be feasible with renewables. Many cities are currently powered by dams. Maybe the internet will not be salvagable, but some form of computing and messaging will still exist.<br><br>The need is to transition to renewables early. The technologies will become cheaper as more become available and more is deployed. Whether we go right back to the 19th century or can salvage enough to manage a 20th century life-style depends on how well we manage the transition.<br><br>I am not confident in humanity's ability to agree and legislate for common sense. We are not going to stop using fossil fuels while we can afford them. Which means that renewables will have to be cheaper to get widespread usage. That is why the current rock-bottom oil prices are a disaster.

As an old-school conservative, I do grok the sentiment, but when we examine the playing field on which wind and solar are being deployed, it's clear that the subsidies they receive are tiny compared with the subsidies 'we' give to the fossil fuel and nuclear industries. [2] While (as a taxpayer and veteran with friends still in various 'sand boxes') I'd love to see all of those zeroed-out in the next Federal budget I don't expect subsidies to stop unless/until the bills are delivered to a President's desk via the fusion unicorns noted above. Utility scale wind and solar projects are being done because they've reached grid-parity and are less expensive than some fossil fuels and nuclear generation in the current world of unbalanced subsidies. They're a slam dunk on a level playing field and don't spew greenhouse gases...we have to field them as quickly as possible if we want a 'gradual descent' rather than jumping over a cliff...which brings up the next and last box...<br><br>Economics (and our fractional reserve banking system) assumes and requires constant growth on an infinite planet.[3] Some schools of economics are beginning to change paradigms a bit (as you know from a recent speaking engagement?), but not quickly enough.

Perhaps as a useful suggestion, Naomi Oreskes could spend an exciting week or two down here during the depths of winter pondering such mind bogglingly basically incorrect and easy to disprove claims about renewable energy. I do tire when I hear those claims: "that something must save us". The universe is under no obligation to save us, especially if we can't display a modicum of good sense and attempt to save ourselves.<br><br>Does this make me a "climate denialist"? Hardly, this summer has shown me just how sharp the pointy end of climate can be. And there are parts of this continent doing it harder than here too. On a bright note, given her age, I might be able to put Naomi to work hauling firewood, but from the Internet images, she doesn't look to me like she would be up for too much hard work. On a serious note, a couple of hours a week in a gym will never provide the sort of physical and mental endurance a person needs to accomplish hard physical labour and still be fit and well enough to get up and do it again the next day and the day after that too. And then there is knowing when to stop and take a break and when not to work at all. I wouldn't be betting the farm on the chances of renewable energies being able to save industrial civilisation - especially when you add in the complexities of an increasingly hostile and uncaring climate.<br><br>That lack of common sense is what motivates my actions here. That's why despite the fact that today is 33'C (91.4'F) in the shade in a few hours’ time, I'm going out in that hot sun to move another cubic metre (a bit over a cubic yard) of manure. Because people talk so much rubbish about the future that to me that talk doesn't stand much close scrutiny. I hate to use the mental image of the lifeboat, but I was on that metaphorical ship and it wasn't going anywhere good and I jumped ship as soon as I understood the risk. Maybe jumping ship may land me in even more troubled waters - at even greater risk, but it sure as heck is better than sitting around and waiting for the inevitable which is that the Titanic will (and did) sink taking most hands down with it.<br><br>I read that James Lovelock book. He didn't seem like the sort of guy to muck around. But I recall - and someone please correct me if I am wrong - that he may have been overly troubled - even possibly despondent - by his own experiences at the hands of nature in a rural area.<br><br>Thanks for the link to the methane crater. Wow. Not good. What interested me about that was that they only found water in the crater at about 70m below the surface level which may indicate that the area - if warmed up significantly - may actually be quite arid. Just sayin. Anyway, I'm surprised the author didn't suggest an immediate drilling program to capture the methane so that it could be burnt for scientific purposes. ;-)!<br><br>cont...<br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c8443594086854699203 title="comment permalink">12/23/15, 8:53 PM</a><br><br>

I wonder if the irony was lost on the author that the publisher was the New Yorker and as such was also subject to future inundations. Dunno, that might be a bit subtle for them. Total thumbs up for the cheeky wag at NASA who named the new satellite "OMG" - that is the sort of stupid thing I would have done. Total respect!<br><br>I have to maintain a certain level of humour about this stuff, because down here we are already generally 3'C over the long term average. Last year and the year before were generally 2'C above the long term average. There's a bit of fat for further temperature rises, but it gets harder here every single year – but I do learn and adapt.<br><br>The other thing that worries me particularly is that very few people - outside of a small fringe element - are considering agricultural techniques that can adapt to more challenging climactic conditions. The simple answer lies in the fact that these adaptions are much lower yielding than our present industrial agricultural methods. It is no different than the solar PV energy in that nature provides much lower energy than what we have become accustomed to from fossil fuels.<br><br>Down here the aftermath of bush fires driven by hotter, drier, wetter and windier weather conditions is that one day pretty much everyone in this corner of the continent outside of the inner urban areas can look forward to the prospect of living in what looks to me like a war zone. And oh yeah, the outer suburbs (and perhaps middle suburbs as well) are toast. Seriously – they don’t stand a chance from bush fires. If anyone doesn’t believe that claim have a look at the Canberra 2003 bush fires – and Canberra is our national capital city.<br><br>Quote: "balancing concerns about the climate with the supposed need for perpetual economic growth" - well those are contradictory outcomes and it was never possible to achieve both. As to perpetual economic growth - that concept is insane.<br><br>Thanks for writing this essay.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br>PS: I've got a new blog entry up: <a href=http://ferngladefarm.blogspot.com.au/ rel=nofollow>Bikram Ultimate Fighting Kangaroos</a>.

There is actually a link to a video I made of two young buck kangaroos fighting in the orchard in the past few days.

I helped a hot and distressed Koala Bear cross the road and climb into the shade of a tree. The bees are hot, I'm hot, the world is hot down here. But I also show how I'm adapting to this new normal. I also show how the garden is adapting to this heat. There are lots of yummy berries to eat still and there was a brief rainfall.

Many current renewable technologies won't be viable without fossil fuels to provide crucial energy and resource inputs for their manufacture, installation and maintenance -- a point I've made and documented at length in previous posts here. I agree that there's a future for renewable energy, but not as a substitute power source for the kind of extravagant energy-wasting societies we have now; instead, such power sources as solar water heating and distributed wind power will help fuel societies and technologies very different from the ones we have today -- and, of course, there's the little matter of a dark age to get through first. <br><br>Peter, my house is about 250 meters above sea level, and there's a mountain range between me and the ocean, so we're pretty much set. I don't know that I'd want to live anywhere near the sea, all things considered. <br><br>Marcu, the only changes I'd make in my recommendations have to do with the hard fact that there isn't anything like as much time to prepare now as there was when I started this blog. If you're going to collapse now and avoid the rush, you'd better get a move on, because the rush is on its way. <br><br>Eric, I know. I've seen exactly the same thing happen more times than I can count.<br><br>Mark, exactly. At this point we have a choice: we can shut down industrial society, and a lot of people will die, or we can keep it running until it slams face first into the brick wall of the future, and a lot of people will die. Take your pick!<br><br>Howard, yep. The one upside is that evolution works fast in harsh circumstances, and new species that can handle the poisons will emerge in due time. <br><br>Rapier, I wonder if there's any way we can talk climate-change deniers into investing heavily in Miami Beach real estate as a way to show the rest of us how wrong we are? Seeing their investments underwater in the literal sense would be some consolation...<br><br>William, I was figuring, given the European flavor, that it was set in northern Scandinavia or Siberia. For what it's worth, the biosphere has shrugged off drastic climate changes plenty of times in the past, and I expect it to rebound fairly well once the initial shocks are over. <br><br>Blueback, I hadn't seen the documentary, but I'm familiar with the research.

You aren't really conscious of your energy use till you live off grid and have to depend on what you produce--and that's with solar panels, which aren't sustainable long term! It gave me a great appreciation for energy demands of a typical lifestyle, as well as how well one can live with less energy.<br>There's something rewarding about shoveling manure (or cleaning out a chicken coop), or doing anything real. It can be meditative. "Only mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun." Maybe you could ditch the English tradition, take a midday siesta, and work midday to sundown instead?

Far more crucial is the direct and indirect dependence of most renewable technologies on fossil fuels, and real-world studies of the actual performance of large-scale solar and wind installations (as distinct from on-paper determinations of "grid-parity") show the yawning chasm between the rhetoric and the reality. Finally, I'd disagree that the feeble agreement that came out of COP-21 is better than the alternative -- quite the contrary, it lulls the inattentive into thinking that something is actually being done, and thus makes it less likely that people will make the necessary changes in their own lives.<br><br>Cherokee, I've noticed consistently that those people who insist airily that of course we can maintain a modern industrial lifestyle on renewable resources have never tried to live that way themselves, and I appreciate the regular feedback from you and others who do rely on sun and wind for power -- it's a badly needed reality check.

At least for the Abrahamic religions, Man is viewed as being of central interest to the universe as a whole, I'm not certain whether this is also true for the great eastern religions, but it does seem to be true for the followers of progress (we have a destiny amongst the stars after all). Personally I think this current within our cultural makes it impossible for us to see exactly what we are doing here. I wonder if part of the reason why our society is constitutionally incapable of dealing with the threat of climate change/resource depletion is that at some level we belief that we are somehow important to the universe and it will not allow us to die. Like a junkie staring down his dad, certain that in the end he'll relent, he won't let him die alone on the street he can't, except we're not staring down our dad, not even a stranger, probably the best analogy would be an amoeba staring down a German Shepherd. The universe does not care either way, whether or not we cook ourselves, it does not think we have a destiny which we must fulfill, and therefore it will not step in at the last minute to save us from the consequences of our mistakes (after having learned our lesson). This is not an after school special, and the cost of failing to heed the warnings ahead of time will not be a scare, it will be massive amounts of avoidable human suffering.<br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c1385584297144259459 title="comment permalink">12/23/15, 9:59 PM</a><br><br>

Believe me, it was a shock to me initially too. Seriously, I had delusions and daydreams about the solar power system and reality quickly gave me a solid thump on the backside! However, I learned and adapted and can now live within the strict limitations imposed on my energy use by nature – whilst trying not to stress the system which will shorten its lifespan. The thing that worries me about the: "there just must be some way" brigade is that they'll place even more burdens on the biosphere at some point in the future instead of knuckling down and getting on with the gritty realities.<br><br>As to the second point that you raised, yeah, I worry about that too. However, I reckon that it won’t be until the waves are lapping over the shop fronts consistently that adaption gets discussed by the pundits.<br><br>Well it is pretty hot here today and I was intending to work in the old chicken enclosure and recycle some of the upright pine posts. The heat kept me inside instead. That was lucky for me that I wasn't actually working there, because a huge branch dropped from a great height and fell onto that area. When the trees here get heat and water stressed they sometimes adapt by dropping limbs as this huge tree did this afternoon. Oh my - that was close.<br><br>On a more positive note, this heat brings out the insects and I just spotted a huge diversity of butterflies and native wasps cruising around and enjoying the flower gardens.<br><br>How is your winter going, did you have snowfall for the solstice?<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br>Hi Shane,<br><br>Thanks very much for your comment last week. I see the stresses down here too as well as the additional stress of trying to maintain a facade of normalcy.<br><br>Yeah, being disconnected from the mains grid certainly teaches one the real limitations of renewable supplies. The funny thing is that I heard a podcast from the Extraenvironmentalist (Justin and Seth do a great job - respect dudes!) and they were talking to a NZ dude (Stephen Baumer?) and another lady (Nicole Foss) who were saying solar electricity is really expensive. But I was thinking to myself it all really depends on how much you expect out of your system. A system for a couple of lights, a pump, fridge and a radio. No problems - cheap as.<br><br>Enjoy your manure too and it is rewarding isn't it? And I avoid the midday sun and go off and do other things. For example it is easier for me to reply over summer than winter because of the break in the middle of the day.

After a 3 hour flight across half a continent I borrowed a car to drive another 400km. All this to spend a week with the family at the beach house. Some observations:<br><br>- yes, I see the irony in expelling so much carbon to visit a beach house. Google image search 'wooli' to see just how bad it will be (but oh so nice to visit right now)!<br><br>-try doing that trip without fossil fuels (with favorable winds maybe a week in a fast yacht?) Yet it is considered mundane, or perhaps even a right, to travel so flippantly and cheaply.<br><br>- the drive South from Brisbane includes some very shiny new sections of 4 lane freeway. It is an ongoing project by the federal and state government to upgrade 1000km of highway between Brisbane and Sydney to dual carriage way. Complete with tunnels, overpasses and bypasses so cars and trucks can stay at 110kph the entire journey. They have been going for nearly 20 years now, spending countless billions. Meanwhile the only rail link between two cities with a combined population exceeding 6 million is a single track to serve all passenger and freight traffic. The mind boggles.<br><br>-I sometimes wonder if I should feel bad at such prolific consumption? At home I homebrew, run chooks, grow vege's and buy used goods but it is all for nothing the second I board a plane (which is usually twice a year). If this is the titanic, perhaps I am the guy hanging at the bar while the music plays. Bottoms up! How do other ADR readers feel about this sort of thing?

I expect it's the feeling of helplessness that fuels the denial, as you imply. My husband and I were discussing this and wondering if we had seen the same process play out in other areas. We remembered our Peace Corps training sessions in West Africa. All the volunteers had, presumably, known about and accepted the risks of living in an undeveloped tropical country; however, when the Peace Corps nurse told us, "If this snake bites you, you'll die," they all balked. "What do you mean?" they shouted. "What is Peace Corps policy? What medicine should we have in our kits? Tell us what we're supposed to do!" With no apology, the nurse said, "You're 'supposed to' die. You'll die." The training session broke up, and people broke into little groups complaining about her lack of bedside manner and unhelpful attitude. They wanted something easy and pleasant they could DO to mitigate an unpleasant reality.<br><br>RepubAnon, I think the phrase you want is "Apres moi, le deluge."

Everything from the conference itself was entirely self-congratulatory, yes, but the reports covering it - including from the BBC and other major news channels over here - seemed to have a more confused attitude of, "They keep saying it's good. It must be good, right? … Guys?" The main evidence provided for "good" is that it didn't turn into Copenhagen Mark II - that at least they've agreed to *something*, however feeble that something might be. Which itself, as you've noted above, might actually be worse than nothing, if it lulls people into complacency; but as it is the attitude feels less like complacency and more like grasping at straws for something positive to say.<br><br>What I'm getting at is: people are noticing. That percolation of awareness is itself too little, too late: to extend your metaphor, those of the passengers voting for evacuation of the ship will continue to be shouted down until there's no chance of anything but a panicked scramble; and noticing that there are gaping holes in the current narrative doesn't mean people immediately see through them to the truth. All the same, I'm stumbling across more and more commentary by people in surprisingly mainstream locations - though of course this is relative, but encompassing spheres of thought and activism beyond the usual environmental/de-industrial/peak oil crowd - who've either read your blog or come to some of the same conclusions on their own. Giles Fraser ("Magical thinking about progress won't save planet Earth") and Charlotte Du Cann ("Paris: the untold story") come to mind. (Yes, the writers are part of the typical crowd - but they were published in a mainstream newspaper and a Scottish independence website, which is less so.)<br><br>Meanwhile, it could well be the hottest December on record, but of course global warming isn't real because there was a temperature peak in '48. (Or thereabouts - I'll admit I'd retreated into the familiar "You're never going to understand this, are you?" despair and wasn't paying complete attention.) My own coastal city is rather less vulnerable to sea level rise than some, but we'll still be underwater if/when the Greenland sheet goes… Ah, well.

The plan(s) when I filed for social security this summer were to either A) take regular p/t job at hospital when 2 techs retired end of year and "suspend" SS, or B) continue per diem 1-2 days/week at hospital with early SS. Instead, the lab hired 2 long-time friends 4 months in advance and dropped me from the schedule. They couldn't be bothered to tell me, but left me in late August to find the September schedule without me on it! You wrote about "unthinking cruelty" a few weeks back; this struck me as more than thoughtless, lol! To add insult to injury, the manager subsequently apologized that she didn't want me to think they didn't appreciate all I'd done for them; she just "forgot" to call me and let me know! To add further injury, they then tried to string me along through the fall, emailing for my availability as "they may have a few days this month" which inevitably turned into the minimum 1 day/month rule to keep per diems. In October the gambit became clear: they were trying to sucker me into covering Thanksgiving and Christmas. I responded by setting their emails to delete.

It's proving to be an immensely difficult task so it's not surprising to me that COP 21 didn't produce more impactful results in changing belief systems around the world. As we all know, religion (belief systems) can motivate people to do amazing things with immediacy or take no action if something conflicts with their beliefs.<br><br>In your series of postings about the different "Eras" earlier this year the content was mostly based on the economy. If you transpose those ideas onto climate change then you can probably say with almost certainty that we're living in the Era of Impact. I can't think of any climate event in recent memory that compares to COP 21 in scale. The fact that it received more media attention than a scrolling headline under a talking head speaks volumes.

I confess that i enjoy more your sharp political analysis than fictional stories because i find reality nowadays can be a gripping story more dramatic than fiction. <br>I have 2 observations:<br>1- while it is true that currently methane is quickly degraded in atmosphere (and a generally accepted fact in climate science) I think that this is not necessarily true in the future: methane is degraded primarily by reaction with oxydrile ions generated, if i am not wrong, by lightning. If for any reason the oxydrile production falls then methane permanence will increase dramatically. I can see 3 reasons for methane permanence to become longer :a-saturation of oxydrile (i.e more methane is released than oxydrile is generated) b-drought reduces lightning and oxydrile generation in some areas c-huge methane releases could drastically reduce oxygen concentrations in air as during the permian extinction and consequently reduce oxidryl generation.<br>2-this deal sounds exactly like the transition from the denial to the bargaining phase of trauma.. it is still totally unreasonable of course but it is already positive imo.<br><br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c4785408067799688753 title="comment permalink">12/24/15, 8:19 AM</a><br><br>

Wishful thinking at its best... The 2015 paper on a 100% water/wind/solar grid ignores little things such as affordability of the buildout of all that infrastructure within a collapsing economy, let alone the growing "demand" for power in the theoretically ever-growing economy. Here in the real world, the reason subsidizing solar PV is politically acceptable is because solar power roughly coincides with peak electricity "demand" due to extravagant use of air conditioning. The high price the utilities pay for electricity from solar PV is actually lower than what they need to pay natural-gas-fueled "peaking plants" for power at those times. A financial collapse would destroy that "demand". And the sun will still not shine on winter nights. Hydropower has its limits, and in some parts of the world is facing catastrophe due to climate-change-induced droughts. Yes, renewables can be helpful - in the context of a radical reduction in total energy use.<br><br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c361901627529752144 title="comment permalink">12/24/15, 9:12 AM</a><br><br>

We don't have that much experience with breeder reactors, so like all else with this "renewable" energy source, it would take vast public funding to make it happen. Then there is the reality of our experience building operating nuclear power generating stations. We'll most probably be adding a large measure of crisis and nuclear contamination to climate change. I expect that this will be implemented full scale regardless of the risks.

Even if ALL greenhouse pollution magically went away overnight.<br><br>And that means, for us here in the Golden Caliphate I-mean-state, that San Francisco Bay is going to about double in area, inundating a huge chunk of the Central Valley and turning Tracy into a seaport. (My one quibble with Retrotopia is that Cali is likely to have more than a civil war to deal with - and substantially less potable water and agricultural land.)<br><br>It also means that the current estuarial biomes are toast, regardless of conservation efforts. Soil remediation, on the other hand, is increasingly critical. The over-fertilization of Central Valley soils means that there is a huge stock of nitrates and nitrites just waiting to get leached by rising water. Meaning our Emergent Bay will be a dead zone unless something is done about that. Not to mention the heavy metals and the refinery site....<br><br>The levee system - currently in need of around a billion dollars worth of renovation and repair - can be abandoned. The current levees will be underwater - simply repairing them will be throwing money and effort away. A Big Quake that knocked them down would only be speeding up the process by a decade or two.<br><br>More generally:<br><br>Real estate, as I understand it, operates on a 15-30 year depreciation cycle. Therefore, I would expect to see real estate demand begin to drop in vulnerable areas, with an accelerating long-term trend downward as greater-fool theory runs out of fools. Those trends are more likely to be signaled by flood insurance rates than by listing prices.<br><br>Those rates, in turn, will be affected by climate models of rainfall and runoff.

The consequences of continuing to treat the atmosphere as a gaseous sewer for humanity’s pollutants are becoming increasingly hard to ignore, but nearly everything that defines a modern industrial economy as “modern” and “industrial” produces greenhouse gases, and the continued growth of the world’s modern industrial economies remains the keystone of economic policy around the world. The goal pursued by negotiators at this and previous climate conferences, then, is to find some way to do something about anthropogenic global warming that won’t place any kind of restrictions on economic growth."<br><br>When looking at why, our governments and media refuse to look at any solutions that don't genuflect to the delusion of endless growth it's clear that to do so would be career suicide. Both governments and the mainstream media [MSM] are captured by the corporations both through their 'donations' to parties that don't seriously rock the capitalist boat and through the fear of a barrage of negative advertising by those corporate powers if they did actually say anything meaningful about the inevitable collapse our current gluttony will result in.<br><br>Furthermore the govts and MSM are also captured by their middle class's [every country has a group of powerful interests who benefit in the short term at least from business as usual] unreal expectations of endless more and the refusal of almost everyone to even consider wanting less. The fact is that the scope of change necessary to reverse the environmental calamity our consumer culture has created would crash capitalism and along with it all market based imaginary wealth.<br><br>In his essay Greer invokes the Titanic metaphor saying in comparison with COP21: "...after a great deal of debate, the passengers aboard the Titanic voted to impose modest limits sometime soon on the rate at which water is pouring into the doomed ship’s hull." But IMO, as seen in the picture above, the Titanic metaphor more aptly applies to the implications of class division.<br><br>On the actual Titanic the leadership made sure the band playing kept playing lest the passengers think something was REALLY wrong. So too on our metaphoric Titanic our elites understand that no good can come from standing up and saying it's all over thereby causing a global panic. Instead our elites, like the real Titanic's 1st Class passengers, are quietly climbing into their lifeboats while the band plays on. i agree with Greer that it's too late and expensive at this point for anything meaningful to be done about environmental collapse that dwells within the realm of the capitalist myth. We're not teetering on the brink of disaster, we're well over it, the band kept playing on the Titanic, even as it sank, so no one would panic, especially not those passengers, who like us, locked into steerage.<br><br>Meanwhile, behind the scenes, the real world elites are buying time and making arrangements including locking us in steerage so as to insure we go down with the ship while they - the wealthy and their ilk - take the few available lifeboat seats - private islands, mountaintop retreats, lavish bunkers or maybe on Mars - that might be able to grow food in the future and are currently being stocked up while we debate and their storm troopers protect them.<br><br>The modern tune has verses about how 100% renewables will save us, how nuclear energy will save us, how divestment from fossil fuels will save us or how "God" will save us and how unenforceable promises will save us. They are all crap designed to hypnotize us into voluntarily assuming our places in steerage.<br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c825099266910273986 title="comment permalink">12/24/15, 11:58 AM</a><br><br>

I've written here before about what happens when the fantasy of Man the Conqueror of Nature has to deal with the real world. <br><br>Lou, that's a hugely important question. What we call "progress" is leading straight to places where no sane person would want to go; everyone complains about the rapidly multiplying downsides -- and yet if you suggest doing anything other than trudging along the same misbegotten path toward the same goal, people stare at you as though you've sprouted an extra head and then start coming up with reasons why they have to keep on trudging along toward a goal they hope they never reach. It really is weird. <br><br>Chloe, I hope you're right. If the sheer emptiness and pointlessness of this latest round of climate conferences sinks in, people might finally get around to asking what they themselves can do -- and then maybe a few of them will notice that if they want to leave the carbon in the ground, that means that they, personally, need to stop burning so much of it. <br><br>Tidlösa, not at all. Christmas is the story of a child who was born in poverty, lost his father at an early age, grew up in a nation under the brutal rule of a foreign despot, was homeless as an adult, was betrayed by people he loved and trusted, and suffered a cruel, painful, and humiliating death -- and rose above all of it.

Anthropogenic climate change is the gift that just keeps on giving. <br><br>Ron, I'm not too worried about the survival of our species. Human beings are among nature's supreme generalists, right up there with rats and cockroaches; for megafauna, we're remarkably difficult to kill. It's entirely possible that we'll get an oceanic anoxic event -- that's the situation where the deep marine circulation shuts down, and everything below about 200 meters dies; that's one of the normal ways that the Earth deals with excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Still, those happen fairly often in planetary history, and don't produce the apocalyptic consequences that the far end of the climate change lobby likes to insist. <br><br>Art, no holiday greeting you care to offer will offend me!<br><br>Renaissance, funny. <br><br>Mary, glad to hear that you told your former employers to get lost. That sort of thing is embarrassingly common these days! It's also good to hear that you've managed to surf the wave of change without too much trouble. A happy solstice to you and yours -- particularly the cats!<br><br>Mr. B, I suspect it's going to take more than a few flooded cities. I honestly expect that when southern Florida becomes an uninhabited salt marsh and Manhattan has to be abandoned to the homeless because the subways and utility tunnels are full of seawater, the media will be babbling about how everything will be fixed soon and Goldman Sachs is relocating to Omaha because the bankers prefer the climate there...<br><br>Brian, I have that book! It's been a long time since I read it, and I'll have to revisit its discussion of global warming. As for climate summits, nah, I see them as pure froth. Only a few activists pay attention to them once they're off the front pages. <br><br>Jay, I'll give him a look. Thanks!<br><br>Gabriela, yes, it was called the early medieval warm period, and was followed by the Little Ice Age. Of course climate changes on its own -- which is all the more reason not to mess with it by treating the atmosphere as a sewer! The fact that a grizzly bear might have its own reasons for bashing your head in is not a good reason to poke it with a stick...<br><br>John, thank you. <br><br>Dorda, if I recall correctly, ultraviolet light also breaks down methane into carbon dioxide and water. Nor do lightning storms seem to be getting any less frequent -- check out the latest storms in the US southeast, which until recently didn't usually get cataclysmic thunderstorms complete with tornadoes in December...<br><br>Brother G., yes, we dodged that bullet. Here comes the next one. <br><br>Moshe, I think people have their eyes scrunched shut, their fingers in their ears, and are shouting "La, la, la, I can't hear you" at the top of their lungs, because they know what's happening and can't deal with it.<br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c7799777899366463533 title="comment permalink">12/24/15, 6:20 PM</a><br><br>

As for geoengineering, until human beings are smart enough to solve the three-body problem, we have zero business thinking that we can manage something as overwhelmingly complex as planetary climate. <br><br>Tye, anywhere on the western slopes of the Appalachians might be worth trying; we're far enough east not to get the droughts, and underpopulated enough that land and housing is cheap. <br><br>Mgalimba, maybe so, but it's a sermon worth hearing. <br><br>Wolfgang, better you than me.

At the point of condemnation the owner has options: retain full ownership of the territory between defined coordinates which will soon be underwater, and become responsible for the property’s complete removal before that eventuality; or relinquish any claim to ownership and at the same time be absolved of any responsibility for what happens to it thereafter.<br><br>The state would them have a sort of reverse auction for the property’s salvage rights. If ownership is retained, the title holder has first refusal for salvage rights; if ownership is relinquished, any qualified salvage operation could compete for the job. The bidder that accepted the lowest state subsidy for the salvage operation would win the job, with the additional incentive of being awarded an easement for controlling ocean access at that spot until such time as the next property inland is overtaken by the rising ocean level and is condemned in turn. In some cases that temporary easement and the value of salvageable materials on the property could be hoped to substantially offset the cost of the salvage subsidy to the state.<br><br>This proposal would evoke howls of outrage from conservatives and libertarians who regard property rights as a sort of religion.

The point is that "solutions" is one way to replace all fossil fuel today with a 100% renewable grid without any new tech or unicorns. Renewable doesn’t just mean wind or PV, though – there’s much more available than just those options. Affordability is surely a factor, collapse is a factor. But we’re going to spend the money one way or another regardless - what's the best way to spend the cash? From a grid perspective I’ll give you the point for afternoon peak – for today. But fossil energy continues to increase in price and cost while renewable generation prices and costs are decreasing much faster. By the way, the sun is always shining somewhere and we have plenty of sustainable ways to store energy for later use – even at night.<br><br>I agree with you overall about the very likely reduction in hydro generation on a warming/drying planet – yet climate change is really climate disruption – and that means disruption of the hydrologic cycle – and that means some places will get much more water. To use a turn of phrase I really hate in this context, some areas will be hydro “winners” while most areas lose. Look at Jacobson's plans - each state includes capability for that state. Geothermal generation is available for some; tidal for others. I strongly recommend that you read Jacobson’s papers and check his assumptions and his math. Then become familiar with the Third Industrial Revolution plan being implemented in the entire EU, China, and other areas. Then hit RMI’s Reinventing Fire plan. Each of those is designed to remove all fossil and nuclear generation (RMI’s plan keeps a bit of natural gas for peaking) within 30 years while costing the same or less than we’re already going to spend.<br>(cont)<br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c1140318802371462315 title="comment permalink">12/24/15, 9:41 PM</a><br><br>

I don’t have a TV or use social media. Lights are LED or a few remaining CFL. I relied on my feet and a bicycle while living without a car in this town with very poor mass transit (and now drive a small EV as this disabled veteran’s body isn’t working like it did when I was 30). I’ve made my own ethanol and biodiesel fuel, composted with worms and black soldier flies, used aquaponics and raised chickens. I’ve got solar thermal equipment, a complete PV system, rainwater harvesting/filtration equipment, and parts for a biomethane digester in preparation for a move to a small piece of property that’ll become a permaculture farm with a passive solar house (in the form of an Earthship). I know exactly how many kWh I use and exactly how it’s used. To show the benefit of passive solar and appropriate design, both the apartment I’m renting now and the planned Earthship have the same floor space and I assume all that I’ve pared my life down to here will transfer there (including the solar oven, Kitchen Aid mixer and bread machine). The Earthship will be powered with 2200W of PV, one 4x8’ solar thermal panel, and fuel from a 3 cu m biomethane reactor for cooking and back-up hot water generation. The ‘ship will also collect all my water and reprocess grey water for re-use while providing some food. Construction is carbon negative right from the start. My current quarters are 100% -I’d need more than 10 times the PV on this building for an annual net-zero electricity balance.<br><br>The ability to cut 90% of electricity use relative to an average American is not a pipe dream or a paper exercise – it’s been done all over the US and Canada for the 40+ years Reynolds has been building Earthships. I’ve already linked info from the Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage in NE Missouri that’s also cut 90% off their per capita energy consumption.

It's not immediately apparent that we even have enough fossil fuels to get to certain levels of climate change. Of course, with land use and deforestation we can still manage some nasty levels, but how much? I learned that their climate change models assumed no limits on carbon emissions.

If almost all current energy sources require economic intervention either for viability or for the greater good of the people then it would seem reasonable to assume that energy produced at scale needs a collective approach rather than free market. It would also seem reasonable to assume that any viable energy source would need to be able to produce enough energy to repair and replace itself ad infinitum plus energy to cover externalities before there is energy for consumption. <br><br>I think your point on externalities being off balance sheet has been covered by yourself many times but examples are becoming clearer each day, e.g. the hottest global temperatures in the past couple of months.<br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c636325244130194227 title="comment permalink">12/25/15, 12:59 AM</a><br><br>

Yes I must have read it because I remember the Great Lake where much of Southern England is now. But I do not have a copy in the house.<br><br>We grew up with Jefferies writing, almost by accident from our omnivorous reading. We recognised from his description of the <i>sound</i> of a water meadow singing at midsummer our own remnant meadow beside what was by our time an anoxic stream (creek), when our sharp ears were applied to the deep warm grass and we listened to the dense forest of creatures. What was later astonishing was to find that it actually <i>was our stream</i> he was writing about from the same bridge (we had a concrete replacement) when he leaned over to look into a then pristine chalk-water heaven.<br><br>London? Yes, the underground will be full of the whisper of salt water, as I wrote after a brief ‘vision’ given to me back in the 70s. Not so sure about quantifying toxic pollution – that was something we focussed on in the 80s. Ask Bill, but I remember that bio-accumulation was the killer – you know strontium in the growing bone or heavy metals or organochlorine pesticides in the ocean food chains or lead (Pb) or chromium that make soils deadly forever or until the good earth buries them deep enough. We and other species are very lucky that dioxins seem not to accumulate in food chains; otherwise the post-war chemists really would have poisoned the lot of us and it would have been too late. But the Thames mud will generate mercury compounds as gases from the anoxic bacterial depths to re-enter the world food chains for a long time to come.<br><br>Jefferies was horrified by tar used for paving. It was clearly full of biocide but I am impressed how quickly nature breaks down most petrochemicals. (There are some exceptions; WW2 USAF air strips across flat low lying East Anglia still leak solvents into the groundwater from old spillage.)<br><br>Biodegradables in sufficient quantity from ‘half-baked’ (?) technology sewage treatment plants (i.e. those serving the modern suburb we lived in when children) still make streams anoxic. I remember we children watched the industrious water voles (‘Ratty’) who being herbivores survived in their galleries along our smelly stream among the roots of the grey willows grown old, which were full of nests of small birds. Sadly ‘they’ canalised our stream for much of its length just about the time I was growing up.<br><br>Yes, Jefferies has something; he always did!<br><br>best<br>Phil<br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c2478976784275700485 title="comment permalink">12/25/15, 5:57 AM</a><br><br>

Robert, congratulations to you for beating me to it.<br><br>Some weeks back I mentioned that the new president of my undergraduate college claims that we are now in the Creative Economy, and I wondered in my comment that week what he meant by that. Earlier this week I received the latest issue of the alumni magazine, featuring his inauguration in October, which helped to answer that question. Here's the quote, from his inaugural speech: <br><br>"Our liberal arts students are preparing for leadership roles within the new Creative Economy, where a fusing of left and right brains, the rational and the creative, the mind and the soul, are essential to success. ... For this new generation of leaders, the most important skills are integrative and creative thinking, spanning multiple domains of knowledge and frameworks, including the arts, humanities, social sciences, and the natural sciences, all coupled with the ability to formulate cogent arguments and to communicate clearly and powerfully. These are the very skills our students are learning here today at [...]. By blending art and science, today's [...] students are forging the new talents that will provide the superstructure for the future."<br><br>For anyone who thinks that "the elite" know what is happening and are secretly preparing their bug-out sites, read this quote again and again. This institution considers itself to be one of the elite, preparing the next generation of folks to step into the roles of the elite. In the alumni magazine, they are speaking to their fellow elites, attempting to solicit the funds to keep themselves among the elite. We can tell a lot about how they see the world from what they write to each other. From this quote, it's clear they remain committed to the Religion of Progress, thinking their grads will be building the future along the lines of the present, only more so. But any realistic look at the future along the lines of what you've been presenting, JMG, will have those who enter college during the new president's decade or so term much more likely to spend their post-college lives salvaging from the superstructure of the past than building the superstructure of the future.<br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c2526406117096753947 title="comment permalink">12/25/15, 3:17 PM</a><br><br>

The system has generated a total of 5.42 MWh of electrical energy, which at our current rate of about $0.15 per kWh (generated, transmitted, and delivered) is $798. For this, we paid about $15,000 before incentives/subsidies, giving a financial break-even period of about 20 years... which neatly matches the warranty period on the panels. <br><br>However, we got a $1000 incentive from the State of Maryland, a 30%-ish Federal income tax credit, another 30%-ish property tax credit is pending, and we have 5 Solar Renewable Energy Credits to sell in 2016.

An elderly relative of mine moved from a townhouse to a retirement-community apartment, relying on my wife and me to sell the townhouse on his behalf. To make a long story short, it took a few months and price adjustments to find a buyer, and the buyers discovered signs of mold growing in remote corners of the lower level. It's cost us about $10,000 to remediate the mold and close the sale. <br> <br>The moral of the story is that you might have noble intentions about minimizing your energy usage, but if by doing so you save a few hundred dollars per year, but create an environment conducive to mold, you're really doing no one a favor. Assuming that money is a plausible proxy for the energy content of building materials and contractor travel, any energy we saved by not dehumidifying the vacant property was entirely trivial compared to the energy spent to make the property once again fit for occupation.<br><br>I could make analogies: getting heat stroke in the garden and spending $hundreds at the hospital to save $dollars in the kitchen. Being run off the road while biking to save gasoline... Yes, we need to do what we can, but we also need to be <b>wise</b> about how we do it (which is not to say "moderate").

But let's stop using the phrase "net-zero electricity"..."<br>Moshe – I appreciate you and our dialogue. I’m also not a fan of the way some use the “net zero” label to justify putting hundreds of kW of PV on the roof of their McMansion while smugly declaring their greenness either. I only used it as a tool to show the contrast between a typical ‘code compliant’ house and something actually designed for efficiency.<br><br>Something else that came to mind after I sent way too many words to our host last night is that in most areas of the USA it is illegal to have efficient housing. There’s a flat nine acre piece of ground about a mile from me – next to an area grocery store. It has perfect southern exposure for a passive solar house and enough ground for a useful Grow Biointensive market garden/mini-farm. It’s inside the city limits and surrounded by people that could benefit from the food. If we do the thought experiment and attempt to build a self-contained Earthship on the property, we’re in trouble right from the start. The non-traditional looking building dies before ground breaking as it doesn’t pass muster from the ‘architectural review committee’. If we find a way around that hurdle, we end up with a building that collects rainwater, cleans greywater while growing some food, provides electricity via PV, most hot water from a solar thermal panel, heating via passive solar collection, cooling via cooling tubes and the thermal siphon provided by the operable skylights in the greenhouse. Once we move in, we’ve violated a number of state and local codes by 1. not being connected to the power grid, 2. not being connected to the water grid, 3. not being connected to the sewer, and 4. not having a septic tank. As a final nail in the coffin, because a house not connected to ‘modern’ systems is deemed to be unsafe, as we’re being dragged off the property and jailed for negligence and child endangerment, child protective services takes our kids away. It’s insane.<br><br>Dylan said “All this transitioning to renewables is more daydreaming, even our roads are made from oil, please get real folks.” Not all of our roads are made from oil – but most importantly NONE of them have to be made from oil, and they don’t need to be maintained with fossil fuels. That’s really important! Additionally, many of the younger folks (at least in the US) aren’t buying cars, many aren’t getting driving licenses, and nearly all are driving much, much less than their elders. As things continue to collapse and more of ‘regular life’ is re-localized, more roads are transitioning from concrete or blacktop to gravel while others are being abandoned altogether. Don’t let a broad a brush get in the way of getting things done. ;)<br><br>Biofuels don’t seem popular here, yet they can be a very useful and very sustainable way to stop emitting fossil carbon. One example of how it's being done done is a co-op in SW Wisconsin started by Mark Shepard of New Forest Farm. They grow hazelnuts – some of which are pressed to produce oil and high-protein animal feed. The oil is sold to a local food processing company to cook food. The used oil is purchased by the co-op, filtered and de-watered, and used to run the diesel equipment on the co-op farms. His agroforestry methods return 3-7 times the energy per acre than conventional farming. Some here might enjoy his view of reality as I think it fits well with the messages from our favorite Druid – Shepard’s also a student of collapse research. ;)<br><a rel=nofollow> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb_t-sVVzF0</a> <a rel=nofollow> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hlKOZ6TaO0</a><br><a rel=nofollow> http://www.forestag.com/pages/mark-shepard</a> <a rel=nofollow> http://www.acresusa.com/restoration-agriculture</a><br><br>Finally…thanks all for the recommendation – I just finished Star’s Reach and Green Wizardry and enjoyed both.<br>Andy<br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c8011699068445449153 title="comment permalink">12/25/15, 11:48 PM</a><br><br>

In choosing a place to live, rational, logical factors may play only a small part in people's decisions. Even though an area may be doomed due to sea level rise, drought, or other issues of unsustainability due to global warming, people still choose to stay there for non rational reasons, "this is MY HOME, I was born here, I've lived in this house 30 years, all my friends are here, my church/temple/religious group is here, I like the architecture/history, I'm attached to the biome/natural life here, I have so much invested here, etc., etc., etc." So, all the non rational reasons crowd out the rational ones, even for readers here on this blog who live in areas that cannot be sustained due to drought or sea level rise even short term. Very fascinating how the human mind works and how non rational it can be.

The mixing time of the atmosphere is so fast (3 months within hemispheres, 1 year between hemispheres) relative to the ratio between fluxes and atmospheric concentrations that the atmosphere is to all intents and purposes homogeneous. Apparently, the Arctic is warming faster mostly because of a positive feedback between melting ice leading to a lower reflectance of sunlight back out to space (https://acespace.org/blog/ask-ace-why-does-warming-happen-faster-poles).<br><br>If you're not too busy, I'd be interested to hear your take on the fact that carbon emissions in 2014 were higher than they're projected to be for 2015. The Global Carbon Project thinks this is probably not peak emissions (http://www.tyndall.ac.uk/communication/news-archive/2015/global-carbon-budget-2015-video), but in the mainstream science hardly anybody is talking about the positive feedback between demand destruction and reduced exploration for fossil fuels (maybe that's too quick and dirty a summary, more generally said: the physical science projections based on given emissions are much better understood than changes in the economy and/or people's behaviour). So I'm not convinced that scientists opinion on this question is particularly authoritative, so I'm asking for yours.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Erik.<br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c8826704978689302242 title="comment permalink">12/26/15, 9:21 AM</a><br><br>

Stewart in the public library in Evanston, IL. I read it and re-read it. I loved that book, even though many of its nuances escaped me. It was 1949, the book had just been released, and I was thirteen years old. The protagonist is a graduate student when a plague wipes out nearly all of humanity. He becomes the acclaimed leader of a small tribe of fellow survivors. We follow the next forty-odd years as he, his tribe, and nature adapt to the suddenly changed environment. <br>Alerted to the possibility that the Big Comeuppance may be on its way, I have since gravitated toward seeking out the views of those who take a wide-angle lens to survey the prognosis for H. Sapiens. Bucky Fuller taught me about Synergy (that 1+1 can become more than two), that there is no such thing as infinity, and that life is the anti-entropic agent in the universe (by assembling an exquisitely ordered being from random building materials). Ken Wilber clarified the dualism of the objective/subjective universe and the folly of war between science and religion, and pointed out that evolution was a key feature of both faces of this universe. E. O. Wilson reminded me that our social behaviors are strongly hardwired, although not to the degree of specificity as in an anthill or a beehive; and that the teamwork gene which persuades our tribe to be cohesive is in eternal tension with the bellicose gene that enables the clobbering of the rival tribe. Now that we are morphing into one planetary tribe, how can we deselect the bellicose genotype?<br>Now you have appeared, demystifying the dismal science of economics, broadening the scope and reach of religion to include a civil branch, and pleading your case for fossil energy (and the side-effects of its misuse) as the decisive lane restriction blocking our “progress”. Your case has threatened my assumption (civil religion?) of Humanity’s ascendance to the next level. Thus I need to pass it through its hurdles. Your claim that alternative energy cannot save the day (or make it a lot more bearable) needs a few numbers to supplement the verbs and adjectives. It also requires a thoroughgoing negation of the possibility of workarounds and tunneling, while complying with Carnot and Rankine, could pull us through. Perhaps you’ve served up some of that, and I haven’t run across it? <br>Thank you for opening my eyes a lot wider.

On the surface, it reminded me of arms limitation conferences between the world wars. However, before the conference started I had heard TV commentary to the point John Roth makes. Kyoto and other previous conferences were torpedoed by American foot dragging. This time, the US delegates made it clear in advance that getting a treaty through Congress was hopeless, and the conference should not waste any time on agreements that require implementation or enforcement through treaties. That is reality (just as Germany's determination to rearm was reality). The delegates took the advice and didn't waste their time on any of that.<br><br>I agree with Mr. Roth that if COP-21 has any positive results they are beneath the surface. I think a possible useful result is that the framework they set up (and perhaps the personal connections made at the conference) may make it quicker for organizations which are disposed to take action to slow climate change to coordinate their efforts. There are such governments and organizations, and making it simpler for them to say, "We'll do this if you do that," is worth something.<br><br>Concerted action (as opposed to talk) to slow down climate change has merit.

Thus any further substantial increase in atmospheric methane concentrations would need regular ‘new’ very large out-gassing. (Note that decay is due to photo oxidation, so there is little decay during the arctic winter. But of course there is lttle sun energy to be trapped at that time!) <br>2) Methane is a trace gas like CO2 but is measured in parts per billion, not as parts per million for CO2. It’s much greater heat-trapping potency per molecule is somewhat offset by its much lower concentrations. <br>3) Global methane concentrations are however more than x3 higher than they were in the pre-industrial past. (CO2 on the other hand is currently on its way to doubling but is currently 400 ppm c.f. 275 ppm in 1750)<br>4) There appears to be a feedback correlation between arctic wetland methane emission and the reduction of sea-ice cover during the summer due to arctic warming. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015GL065013/full More research is suggested!<br>5) Climate models have correctly assumed since ‘day one’ that the arctic would warm faster than in temperate or tropical latitudes.

There's a simpler reason the Arctic and Antarctic are heating faster than the rest of the globe (Global warming is not evenly distributed). Most of the earth's solar gain is in the tropics and mid-latitudes, where the incoming angle of the sun is closest to vertical and cuts through less atmosphere (which is thickest at the equator, but the difference between a perpendicular angle and a tangent angle is a greater effect). Most of the heat loss is at the poles, where regardless of albedo, the angle of the sun is so low that most of the energy is reflected anyway; albeit snow and ice do this better than open water, which is why the Arctic is warming faster than the Antarctic. The flow of heat from the equatorial regions, where it comes in, to the Polar regions, where it leaves, is via the Hadley, Ferrel and Polar cells, which are large convection cells in the atmosphere. Essentially, a heat pump, moving heat to the poles. So, greenhouse gases, regardless of origin, insulate the poles and reduce heat loss. Presumably, at some point, the heat differential may get low enough to slow this down, which would result in more even global heating. But for the foreseeable future, the poles, especially the Arctic, will warm considerably faster than other regions. Also, water vapor is a powerful greenhouse gas in it's own right, and global warming causes higher evaporation rates, resulting in a more humid atmosphere; positive feedback there.<br><br><br>"If you're not too busy, I'd be interested to hear your take on the fact that carbon emissions in 2014 were higher than they're projected to be for 2015."<br><br>Pretty simple, China finished their build-out, or can't afford it any more.

Your earlier comment got me mulling over population density and what it will mean in the future.<br>According to Wikipedia, the population density of North America in 2013 was 57 per square mile. For Europe it was 188 per square mile, including Russia. I've been gazing at the maps on my wall and thinking about terrain and climate. It appears that North America has a much greater portion of its area that is very cold, very hot, or lacking water, compared to Europe. I'm expecting these places to be tough to live in, once the cheap energy is gone. I wouldn't want to be in Arizona without air conditioning, or the northern plains without fossil fuel heat. If you spend a large part of your time and energy either keeping warm or avoiding the heat it is that much harder to get other things done. In the 19th century the western plains were known as the Great American Desert, and most Canadians have always lived along the southern 100 miles or so of the country.<br>The areas of North America more easily lived in are already densely populated, such as the coasts or the Great Lakes area, although with changing climate patterns other places may beckon. If the melting icecap of Greenland alters the Gulf Stream, as some have suggested, all bets are off for Europe. There is mass migration of climate refugees to consider, and the resulting disruption all over the world. I am already seeing ecosystem change here in New England, as plant and animal species migrate north.<br>So although I also think a lot about where it is practical to live there are so many moving parts/unpredictable changes coming, perhaps it makes sense to include one's personal aesthetic and cultural preferences, and make the best of wherever we are attracted to, as well as practical considerations. <br>No matter where we live, it is always possible to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, like the folks in eastern Europe for much of the 20th century.

I followed it and read the piece as well. I am also interested to hear JMG's take on it. Don't know if I'm close or far, but my interpretation is this:<br><br>The Roman Empire experienced slow catabolic collapse because they were not the only civilization in the ancient world. They had expanded their reach, trade and connectivity well beyond the normal borders that provided them with their essentials - When things got scarce, they could still find food, cotton linen, water, etc. to struggle along, further afield, could trade with or raid other civilizations or groups of people not in their control. There were civilizations and places for their refugees or migrants to go, so they went, which would lessen the burden on the 'center'. The decline of Rome was the beginning of a great migration. Person by person, family by family, precipitating a slow but sure decline and lessening burden on that center, the Roman empire.<br><br>The Moai of Easter Island had no where to go, no outside resources to draw upon. The Mayans, as far as my reading and understanding goes, were consistently at war with any small hunter-gatherer tribes outside of their center - fewer possibilities for any Mayan refugees, although I'm sure there must have been some. Their collapse came from exhaustion of arable land and potable water. They had nothing to alleviate the strain, without any knowledge of other ways to get enough food and water, and as with our own society, had expanded crowded and decayed enough to have lost any thought or ingenuity to 'find another way'. They had no 'plan-B', no knowledge any more of hunting and gathering, could think of no way out. <br><br>Our industrial civilization is in the same predicament in terms of facing the loss of our energy source. EVERYTHING we do/have/use/need is the product of this energy source, (fossil fuels). There is nothing to replace it that is abundant and easy enough for us to stair-step down. At the same time, like the Mayans, our population and our needs have risen up, up up. Our resilience, experience and knowledge of survival sans fossils has diminished and atrophied. There is no civilized outland that would proffer easy adaptation, as the whole globe is in this mess. We have no connectivity to any 'other' place or group of people that can help us get through this in an easier stair-step-down fashion.<br><br>*Well, actually, In a way, we do, and we can, the help is on this blog, and in underdeveloped pockets of the world and our own communities. Whoever thought massive global wealth inequality would have a silver lining, eh!? There are still people out there who know how to live without the benefits we 1st-worlders have taken for granted since birth. <br><br>Most importantly:<br>I recall JMG in a previous essay describing his estimation of it as a 'fractal collapse', imagine a glass castle with many features and turrets, or a craggy Antarctic ice sheet. One small piece falls off the top, nothing happens to the rest of it, some bits fall off one side, everything on top of those bits fall off. A wide chunk of the base at the back melts and drifts away, and a massive section that that base was holding up crashes spectacularly. The whole thing doesn't all happen at once. Some lucky pieces get to drop a bit at a time, but some do crash horribly, en masse. The overall collapse is uneven and unfair. I think this is the most probable. Future historians may look back and say overall that our Industrial Age collapse was fast or slow, but for us individually, it won't matter because for us individually, it will be one or the other and we'll have to deal with that. Adapt to far LESS quickly or die.<br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c7535929973221970320 title="comment permalink">12/26/15, 5:50 PM</a><br><br>

I sometimes wonder if people in your part of the world say to themselves: That was nice that little bit of extra warmth. Without understanding that at the other end of the season i.e. Summer there'll come a time to pay for that winter warmth? Dunno, but there always seems to be a cost to things. All I know is that as the years go on here I hear less and less people proclaiming their love of summer - and when they do, I always ask them how they feel about the 40'C+ (104'F+) days and whether they have air conditioning in their houses. <br><br>Hi Dylan,<br><br>Good for you, that sounds like excellent work. Respect. I wasn't very traumatised because when I lived in the inner city I was only using 3kWh/day anyway - instead I felt a level of frustration and the dawning of an inescapable realisation that this solar PV stuff was good, but during 3 weeks either side of the winter solstice it was not much good for more than 1 peak solar hour per day on average. That was a real eye opener. My wife and I, once we worked past that frustration, got on with adjusting the system to increase the output during that time, whilst at the same time we adjusted our expectations to meet the output of the solar system.

Technically, that’s due to the progressive replacement of coal by natural gas for electrical power generation, plus greater fuel economy in new cars. Countering that is the oil glut: gas prices here in Albuquerque have been under $2.00 a gallon for a while, so people are buying cars and driving more, but the new cars are contributing less CO2 per mile than the older ones.<br><br>As far as I can tell, there isn’t a direct relationship between demand destruction and reduced exploration for fossil fuels at the present time. The reduced drilling and exploration is because of the glut: at the current price it’s not economic to drill more wells and explore in higher-cost areas. One of the things contributing to the glut is that most of the small oil companies have to keep producing to pay the people they borrowed money from for the drilling in the first place. Many of them are doing the intelligent thing: they’re cutting back production to where they are doing just enough to pay their finance charges; this will let them get more out of the wells long term. As long as the Saudis keep flooding the market hoping to drive the US fracking industry out of business, and new sources (read: Iran) are coming online, the glut will continue.<br><br>Once the glut ends, prices will go back up and you’ll see more demand destruction.<br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c1554498308124006700 title="comment permalink">12/27/15, 6:24 AM</a><br><br>

The mere fact that the ongoing process has been re-christened the more politically palatable "Climate Change" from the more challenging, but accurate "Global Warming" tells you exactly how ready the general political and business world is prepared to face this issue. But it is clear that the powers that be will never, EVER, let go of Economic Growth as a universal good. But anyone with any spirt of grounding in any kind of reality based science is well aware that infinite growth in a closed system is flatly impossible. And the Earth and her ecosystem is absolutely a closed system. The only thing coming in is micrometeorites and sunlight; and in all irony, sunlight is now a <i>problem</i>, since we've ignored and fouled up the balancing systems do the ecosystem. <br><br>But issues of sustainability – resource depletion, environmental degradation, economic instability and inequality, and overpopulation are already poised to bring down "business as usual" and Climate Change makes all of the above WORSE with likely accelerating catastrophic outcomes. Given that the United States, with our refined political dysfunction and societal privilege, has been the only nation on earth that has chosen to view Climate Change as a <i>political</i> issue, rather than a scientific issue, through our position of economic and military leadersh– ... um... sorry, dominance, has set the tone for all debate on this civilization ending threat.<br><br>So I did not have much in the way of expectations for COP21. I was actually impressed that there was this much agreement hammered together. But that consensus seems to be based on the stripping out of the proposed resolutions anything binding, actual accountability, any kind of enforcement, or any responsibility of either developed or rapidly developing nations for the plght of the planet. So even though it is significant that there was an agreement at all, it amounts to "it would be nice if we did something about this." The fact that heads are not exploding on the Right wing in American politics - of course they oppose it - as they do all the President's efforts on any topic. The going-thought-the-motions level of the opposition suggests that they are well aware the agreement is pretty empty, as there are no real political consequences to utterly ignoring it's mild and modest provisions. People with more of a basis in reality have been shouting "bulls**t" but the media is largely glossing them over with coverage of ministers and their media flacks congratulating each other. <br><br>Our Right wing politics still are treating Climate Chnage as a Left wing hoax. But all else being equal, I will take the word of the scientists, despite issues in the scientific community, generally have a disposition to pursue the truth and ferret out how <i>things actually work,</i> over that of politicians, where lying, manipulation, misrepresentation, disssemblange, and distortion are desirable and required <i>job skills.</i><br><br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c6328621022263612171 title="comment permalink">12/27/15, 7:45 AM</a><br><br>

I suspect governments in the rest of the world would fare no better. Leaders can't lead people where they don't wish to go but people can't go places that they can't imagine, either.<br><br>This anecdote is less than ideal but has a point...<br>About a month ago, I bought a silver plated trivet at the thrift store. I'm a Steampunk so this wasn't an act of pretension, rather a new toy to feather my Victorian nest. Hot mats are necessary after all and when you can get a silver one second hand (recycled!) for $3, why not? Anyway, after I explained to the young woman who sold it to me what it was (she asked), she dubbed it "very fancy" and after a short conversation, decided that I was fancy, too. In spite of her admiration of the trivet, it was clear that she would not have bought it for herself because she did not consider herself to be Fancy.<br><br>Americans (people?) adopt identities and build walls around themselves. I suppose, in her case, it was a defense against social aspirations that might seem unobtainable but other people have other motives. The point is that before you can scare people with dire predictions, demand great sacrifice, or even entice them with presumed advantages, you must figure out some way to give them a new identity. One that they can believe is not a step down from "who they are," or beyond their belief in who they can be. Fresh vegetables grown in your own yard taste better, are ecologically responsible, give a satisfaction of accomplishment. You might even convince people that the hard work necessary is health exercise. It all means nothing to the vast number of Americans whose identity includes "I can't cook." All the education about why personal cars are unsustainable does nothing to address the collective perception of "the kind of people who ride a bike in the rain to work."<br><br>Perhaps the next conference should focus less on target carbon emissions and more on a new identity for Western Civilization that will happen to be sustainable.

Seems like I read where the only area in North America that rivaled Old World concentration was the Bos-Wash corridor, but even that area doesn't seem as concentrated. I must acknowledge that I've never been outside the Americas. There's still lots of wide open spaces in the South, Midwest, and even parts of the eastern Seaboard away from the coasts--look at the whole of Appalachia.

I certainly did.”<br><br>Per your request, sir...<br><br>JMG: “Far more crucial is the direct and indirect dependence of most renewable technologies on fossil fuels…”<br>Every single part of our ‘modern society’ is dependent on fossil fuels. I suspect that removing the fossil tail is the ultimate goal of moving to renewable energy sources. How should we apply our remaining fossil carbon budget? <br><br> JMG: “…and real-world studies of the actual performance of large-scale solar and wind installations (as distinct from on-paper determinations of "grid-parity") show the yawning chasm between the rhetoric and the reality.”<br>I’d be interested in reading some of the real-world studies of which you speak. Thanks in advance. The ones I’ve seen so far from the ‘real world’ reflect a fossil grid with a bit of renewables shoehorned in, rather than a view toward the latter stages of an energy transition. I mentioned grid-parity in terms of price per delivered kWh. I already showed prices for on-shore wind and PV in Texas. For another example: due to the high cost of shipping oil to Hawaii, PV-derived electricity is less expensive than electrons motivated by their fossil-fueled generators. The price of energy though is completely free from the price and costs of fossil carbon, cancer and deaths in the wake of uranium mining or storage of spent fuel rods (or disasters like Fukushima), of the loss of clean water and ecosystems downstream of coal ash spills, and all the other ‘’externalized’ costs economists ignore. With a full carbon and energy payback in less than four years in the US, PV seems to be a slam-dunk by comparison – even if production is powered only from coal. <a rel=nofollow>http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy04osti/35489.pdf</a> <a rel=nofollow>http://info.cat.org.uk/questions/pv/what-energy-and-carbon-payback-time-pv-panels-uk</a> <a rel=nofollow>http://mediamatters.org/research/2013/01/24/myths-and-facts-about-solar-energy/192364</a> (sorry, I don’t have a good data source for cradle to grave/lifecycle info for wind or other renewable energy sources.)<br><br>Besides, the price of air-conditioned greenhouses the size of Iowa to keep us in corn will likely be much, much more expensive than what we’d pay for wind turbines and building efficiency. (We eat seeds. Each 1°C temp rise reduces seed production about 10% - until it’s too hot to set seed then productivity drops to zero. Lots of hungry people tend to be cranky. Moving the fields to Canada is not an option.) From the viewpoint of economics and ‘the markets’ extinction probably pencils-out better than solar panels, so we have that option as well… <br><br>If it were up to me, we’d stop burning fossil fuels yesterday, stop all subsidies to all fossils and nukes at the same time, and use the money and oil we have left to build as many wind turbines, PV and solar-thermal panels, geothermal wells, concentrating solar towers, biomethane digesters, while also completely redefining building efficiency, as humanly possible with what we have left. Not with the goal of ‘sustaining progress’ but to ease the descent. And maybe so that our kids have something to salvage and haul to the Lakeland Republic after 2065.<br><br>Best,<br>Andy<br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c191787483577113483 title="comment permalink">12/27/15, 1:22 PM</a><br><br>

Of course that was one of Schumacher's core points as well -- the economy is a subset of the environment, not vice versa. <br><br>Kyle, I could see Bagucigalpi's future as a transitional stage. I don't see it as anything that can last long -- in any such situation, the renewable energy infrastructure would be the perfect target for groups outside the elite that wanted to take over, and the usual dynamics of warband formation would spawn an endless stream of young men used to violence, ready to follow any charismatic leader who can offer them the hope of plunder. One by one, the elite bastions would be taken out -- do you by any chance know Jack vance's <i>The Last Castle</i>? Interesting parallels. <br><br>As for Single Problem Syndrome, though, there you're square on target. That's a useful concept, and I'll cite you as its source when I use it in an upcoming post. <br><br>Stuart, I'm really starting to wonder if there's something very important hidden under the flurry of subsidies. Look at the way that industrial societies are catabolizing their own infrastructure, sacrificing their own working classes and industrial plant, engaging in increasingly risky political and military gambles -- why? Could it be that with soaring extraction costs, the fossil fuel economy no longer pays for itself? <br><br>Shawn, the western end of the C&amp;O canal is visible from the window next to me, so I'm inclined to agree!<br><br>Phil, I probably ought to read more Jefferies. <i>After London</i> is the only thing of his I've actually read.

I'd be interested in hearing about that topic also, for what it's worth. <br><br>Robert, undefined "breakthroughs" aren't going to be able to change the laws of thermodynamics, and that's what it would take to allow the diffuse, intermittent energy that can be gotten from renewable sources to power a grid designed to use highly concentrated energy sources that can be burnt at will to match demand.

The very short form is that renewable technologies are dependent on fossil fuels at many stages in their raw materials supply chain, manufacture, installation, maintenance, and disposal; they produce so little net energy that an industrial society can't be maintained on them alone; they're only economically viable where, as in Germany, they receive massive government subsidies; they can't be ramped up fast enough, or far enough, even to cover existing needs for grid power, much less what it would take to replace the fossil fuel consumption of our transport systems; and finally, we're out of time -- the rising impact of climate change and other modes of environmental disruption, combined with the rising impact of resource depletion, is draining industrial societies of the real wealth they'd need for any kind of large-scale renewables buildout. If we'd gotten to work on it in the wake of the Seventies, and matched renewable technologies with massive decreases in demand, it would have been an option, but now? Too little, too late, game over. More on this in an upcoming post. <br><br>MawKernewek, funny. I have this great plan for attaching a rope to the Moon, hitching it to a wheel at the North Pole, and using rubber belts and pulleys to transmit energy from there all over the world...<br><br>Iuval, er, have you noticed that fossil fuels have been declining steadily in price for years now? I should probably do a post about that, as it's been a while since I've talked about the way that economic externalities are used to hide the real cost of fossil fuel extraction, and are circling around to crash demand ahead of supply. <br><br>Sean, I haven't discussed that article before, but the hypothesis it's presenting has been hashed and rehashed endlessly in the doomosphere over the last ten years or so, and was already being proposed in the 1970s -- Roberto Vacca's <i>The Coming Dark Age</i> insisted that industrial society would collapse in the 1980s as a result of that same proposed effect. The central flaw in the hypothesis is that integration, coupling and connectivity, while they amplify crises, also make it easier and more effective for decision makers to respond to those crises; these two effects cancel each other out. The same lesson can be learnt from history -- civilizations take roughly the same amount of time to collapse (around 150 years on average) whether or not they're politically and economically centralized. The cultural fixation on narratives of fast collapse is so emotionally powerful that people have been dredging up the same excuses over and over again to push the same claim; meanwhile, we're already well into the trajectory of fractal catabolic collapse, and things are proceeding along that trajectory at their usual pace. <br><br>SLClaire, as I'm sure you know, "the creative economy" has been being announced in such glamorous and fact-free terms since the 1960s. It really doesn't seem to sink in, at least to the privileged, that such unglamorous, uncreative material products as food, water, shelter, and fuel still have to be provided somehow...<br><br>Alex, by all means enjoy those mealworms!<br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c5948231757808475386 title="comment permalink">12/27/15, 2:48 PM</a><br><br>

They know that if AGW is happening, the industrial experiment is over: the only choice we have left is whether we dismantle it ourselves or wait until Gaia's wrecking ball comes swinging down. It's simply that they can't deal with that reality, and so insist at the top of their lungs that AGW can't be happening. <br><br>Dylan, it's more than twenty; I've talked to enough people who read this blog and are making real changes to be sure of that. Still, you're right that it's not a majority. <br><br>Shane, the relatively low population density of North America is a function of the fact that its previous inhabitants were all but exterminated, and the European settlements embraced (and wrote into law) an extravagant style of land use that largely excludes Old World population densities. Give us another millennium, and things will have balanced out. <br><br>Cherokee, you might be amused to know that we sang that song in elementary school.

Stay hydrated! <br><br>LatheChuck, so here again, the reason why your rooftop array makes any kind of financial sense at all is government subsidies. Thank you. <br><br>Crow Hill, exactly. I would expect also to see Darwinian selection foster the emergence of animal and plant varieties that are less vulnerable to harm from radiation, as those will tend to prosper in exclusion zones. <br><br>Mike, you can find a map of Greenland without the ice <a href=http://maptd.com/what-would-greenland-look-like-without-the-icecap/ rel=nofollow>here</a>. The links on methane release were cited in one of the linked posts <a href=../../2012/04/seascape-with-methane-plumes.html rel=nofollow>here</a>. <br><br>Mirela, that's a nice useful snark. I tend to use the grizzly bear metaphor in the same context; it gets uncomfortable looks and a change of subject.<br><br>Shane, and some people who stay put will be fine. Others will drown, or starve, or suffer one of the other common fates -- and of course some of the people who relocate won't make it, either. It really is something of a crapshoot. <br><br>SV Koho, John Denver gave some very good advice!<br><br>Erik, maybe so, but since the bulk of arctic heating happens over a fairly brief period in summer, any methane venting that happens during that same period will tend to have a disproportionate effect. As for declining fossil fuel consumption, of course! The price of all three fossil fuels is dropping, too. The reason? Externalized costs for fossil fuel extraction from increasingly difficult and expensive reserves (tar sands, fracking, ultra-deepwater wells, etc.) have hit the global economy hard, producing sharp contraction in the real economy (masked on paper by the production of hallucinatory "wealth" in the financial sphere) and thus causing demand destruction that drives down consumption of all kinds.

We all have to learn to reverence what is even while letting it go -- our mortality requires that of us, if nothing else. <br><br>Farmer, "much shorter" is a matter of degree. The figures I've seen suggest maybe five or ten thousand years of extreme high temperatures, followed by a hundred thousand years or so in the ice age deep freeze. Even five thousand years of jungle-planet temperatures, with all ice caps melting and climate bands skidding around like drops of water on a hot griddle, is more than enough to squash industrial civilization and drop the human population globally to a few per cent of what it is today. <br><br>Ed, I've written at great length about the problems with the notion that renewable energy will allow us to keep something like today's industrial civilization running indefinitely. As I've also written at some length, that doesn't make renewables useless -- it just means that today's industrial civilization is a temporary, self-terminating phenomenon, which will be replaced in due time (and after the usual dark age) by less wasteful and extravagant forms of technic society. As for "ascending to the next level," why, yes, that's exactly what I was talking about when I wrote about the civil religion of progress -- a faith-based linear model that maps the imagery of ascent onto the complex, grubby, nonlinear realities of our existence on that planet -- but I think you knew that already. <br><br>Unknown Deborah, I certainly agree that any action that might slow down global warming would be a good thing. I simply don't think that the COP(out)-21 agreement can be described in those terms -- and if the groups attempting to slow global warming had to wait for that media extravaganza to sit down and have quiet conversations of their own, I have to wonder what they've been doing all this while. <br><br>Phil, exactly. Large-scale methane outgassing at a time when the Greenland ice cap is rapidly destabilizing already is not a good sign!<br><br>Shane, I've been pleasantly surprised to find that a lot of preppers are very receptive to what I'm trying to communicate. I suspect that once you grasp the idea that nobody else is going to save you, and personal action is the only option you've got, a lot of blinders fall off your eyes in a hurry. <br><br>Carl, I have indeed. I'm just glad that nobody seems to have set a match to the thing...<br><br>Hubertus, I managed to get through solstice just fine without buying or being given anything from China, but then I'm not into what passes for holiday culture these days!<br><br>Crow Hill, well, that's par for the course. <br><br>Cherokee, glad to hear you got some rain! We're getting heavy rain today, the cutting edge of the storms that have caused so much devastation further west; the high temperature today was 73 degrees F., which isn't exactly normal for late December. Once the big storm blows through, in theory, we should get temperatures close to freezing, but it's still nothing like normal weather. <br><br>Samurai, as usual, we've got Democrats who want to make cosmetic gestures in the direction of global warming and Republicans who find even that intolerable. No, it's not a recipe for a pretty future.<br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c5125134988754319501 title="comment permalink">12/27/15, 3:37 PM</a><br><br>

(You're welcome.) As for "full carbon and energy payback," I have yet to see anybody make this claim who's factored in the entire carbon and energy cost from raw materials through manufacture and installation to disposal; if you leave that out, sure, anything -- even nuclear -- looks viable. It's all very well to engage in handwaving about what the world would look like on the far end of an energy transition, but the extremely low net energy of renewables, their dependence on fossil fuel inputs at a galaxy of points along the entire trajectory from mining the raw materials to disposing of the wreckage (many of which are hugely costly in energy and resource terms to substitute with any less concentrated resources), and the simple fact that we no longer have the time or resources left for a renewable buildout of any size -- not with climate catastrophes already happening around us, and catabolic collapse shifting into gear as well -- means that the only "transition" that's going to happen is the time-honored one called decline and fall. <br><br>Please note that I'm actually quite bullish on the future of renewables. Given a little hard work now, such sustainable renewable-energy technologies as solar water heating, sail transport, and wind turbines can get through the bottleneck of the end of the industrial age and make human societies more sustainable into the far future. It's the fantasy that today's lifestyles can be supported indefinitely on renewable energy sources that I'm trying to combat here. We need to get over the notion that our current lifestyles are anything but the product of an age of wretched excess and absurd extravagance, and recalibrate our expectations to levels that the planet can actually support. Yes, I'm aware that this is a daunting prospect, but it's not as though we have a choice: you and I and everyone else, including our descendants into the far future, are going to have to get used to much less lavish habits, because the cheap abundant energy that powers today's habits is going away, and nothing will bring it back.<br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c5595235484156755865 title="comment permalink">12/27/15, 4:01 PM</a><br><br>

As I said, above we paid out $15K in one year (before subsidies) to generate $800-worth of electric power over the next year. Some degree of performance decline is to be expected over the warranted 20-year life of the panels. I take that as showing that we can lock in the cost of clean power for roughly THE SAME cost as this-year's coal/nuclear power, not that subsidies are required. Subsidies make it a slam-dunk, which kick-starts the industry and builds economies of scale, and so I think that it could continue without them, but I'm not sure about that. Bear in mind that the original purchase price included a lot of skilled labor (marketing, sales, design, permit management, transportation, and installation), not just the hardware, and I wouldn't be surprised to hear that subsidies directly pad the installers' profits. (That is, "Support <b>good-paying</b> jobs!").<br><br>How to weigh the "energy cost" of skilled labor has been weighing on me. It's one thing to look at the EROEI for panel manufacturing; more difficult for the labor part. I'd hate to think that my electrician would, oh, take a vacation in Hawaii!<br><br>By the way, I elected NOT to accept the option of China-made solar panels. IIRC, the silicon was processed in Japan, and the panels assembled in Mexico. 100% US-made was not an option offered by our program.<br><br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c11015820751035617 title="comment permalink">12/27/15, 4:25 PM</a><br><br>

I have a 5.8Kw grid tied battery back up solar system,, and am at 53 degrees north. I receive no subsidies, I buy energy from the grid with 3 parts to the bill, the energy charge per kw, the delivery charge per kw, and other charges just to have the grid available, priced by the day. I sell my excess power for simply the cost of energy per kw. However, there is more to the story than simple payback (although it still is better than putting money in a bank) but for the insurance value of the power. It isn't so much about the couple of bucks of power you can't buy during an outage, it's that your freezer defrosts and your food spoils. Or in the winter, your house freezes and water pipes burst, causing secondary damage. Centralized PV solar systems and subsidies have problems, especially if you only view the output from a financial perspective. A small home system can provide modest lighting,refrigeration and other comforts for a modest cost for many years. It won't run the industrial plants built for cheap power. Understanding on what it can and can't do is the difference between a comfortable, low energy lifestyle and your dreaded "caveman" or refuge existence.<br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c5030516127637937269 title="comment permalink">12/27/15, 4:53 PM</a><br><br>

Those who have a "Grid-Tied" PV system think that because they are producing more energy during the day than they use in 24 hours think this means they are "100% solar". It never seems to occur to them that they are actually only somewhere in the 10% or less area on solar. Check out how many actual "peak-sun" hours are in your area. They're just enabling 3-4 other people to share their solar power during the peak of the day and all the rest of the time still using the same fossil-fuel power. Not to mention the fossil-fuel powered industry that it took to make the PV.<br><br>Here's an example similar to the type that Cherokee Chris uses but with a much smaller system and smaller numbers. I'm working with the local Amateur Radio Emergency Services (ARES) group to get Packet Radio communications into the medical clinic here in our local town down in a valley. Since I'm located up on a ridge overlooking the town, I put up a digipeater on our hilltop and have it running on PV and battery. This system uses only about 5-6 watts average 24 hours a day. The battery that is running it will store about 1200 watt/hours and weighs 65 pounds. With the cloudy Oregon winter weather, I need to have two 200 watt PV panels to make sure that the battery doesn't get discharged too much! All for a system that draws 4-5 watts. On a dark, cloudy day these two 200 watt panels put out a whole 15-25 watts. Somewhat more on lighter days. I'm doing it with PV for the reliability during an emergency, nothing else.<br><br>All this for a 5 watt load!

EROEI is "a" number but not "the" number - as with any other assessment, what comes out depends on where the guy behind the calculator places the bounds of the problem. Hall attempted to analyze installed large-scale grid-connected commercial solar farms and determined that "the" EROEI was about 2.45. That may be a useful number for similar types of systems in Spain, but that EROEI number cannot be applied to "all" use of PV. "Hall said 2.45 so they're all 2.45" is not a good use of this info.<br><br>Here's the problem I have with his number: Most of the energy hit comes from trenches, distribution cabling, and high-tension distribution hardware to move the electrons from the centralized farms to individual houses - and then he appears to have spent some quality time at a Colorado dispensary before adding more lines to his spreadsheet! The EROEI of the actual panels and inverters is lost in that mess. <a rel=nofollow>http://www.wire1002.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/Documents/Reports/110403_How_much_net_energy_does_the_Spain_s_Solar_PV_program_deliver.pdf</a><br><br>To the point: When used in an efficient off grid building, we need to re-work Hall's EROEI calcs by removing at least "access, foundations, canalizations, and perimeter fences, electrical network/power lines restructuring, security and surveillance, communications and remote control and management; fairs, exhibitions, promotions, conferences, etc. (are you KIDDING ME here?!); consultants, notary public, public register, civil servants/public officers, etc; cost of land rent, or long term ownership, energy investments of evacuation lines and rights of way, pre-inscription, inscription registration bonds and fees; associated energy costs to injection of intermittent loads, pump up costs and/or other massive storage systems;insurances, administration expenses, force majeure acts of God and others (didn't we already list insurance?), etc. etc." Per Hall himself, that leaves us with an EROEI of more than 8 - and that's well, well above fracked gas/oil and tarsands (under 3).<br><br>And finally, none of this matters. We'll be able to use a full range of alternate and appropriate energies to run our full economy not because fusion-powered unicorns will arrive with a magic bottomless PV factory, but because our economy will continue to shrink to fit the energy available.

Besides ic.org (where different communities, some as small as a couple of people) are at various stages of detachment,there are two resources I mentioned before, one already going, and one mostly in the planning stage. The Possibility Alliance is a network of communities, families and individuals centered geographically around La Plata Missouri (they are about 5 miles from the small town). They have mostly Amish neighbors, which provides a rudimentary infrastructure for things like horse and bicycle transport, wood stove production and repair and various food production. They use almost no electricity--recently they made a compromise and bought electric cattle fencing run by a small solar panel. They make their own candles from a neighbor's beeswax, and they have a landline phone. They use all hand tools and have built some beautiful, sturdy and cheap structures. They have cows, goats, chickens and horses. They grow their own vegetables but have not made much progress towards grains and beans Their non-amish collaborator neighbors are at various levels of detachment--some have solar panels and cars, some work in town, some even have internet and sell blacksmithing crafts on Etsy *I don't think anyone went as low as getting a TV)... They mostly create their own culture, with music, dance, readings, games, religious meetings of all sorts (I do believe there are some pagans there too) and working together or exchanging goods and services. Their general philosophy is Gandhian, which means much more than non-violence. Tgere are any number of religious affiliations and I think Mr. Carr would not feel the discomfort he felt in a religious commune.<br><br>The other detachment effort is my own idea, the Luddite Manhattan Project, or the Monastic Order of Luddite Scholars. As this is not a place for self-promotion, you can google or contact me about this.

Of course, I realize that we live in a system that provides electrical appliances that run @ either 110-120 or 220-240, and you'd be limiting yourself severely providing other voltages, but I do wonder just how much high voltage adds to the complexity of the system.<br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c8919756428654374322 title="comment permalink">12/28/15, 8:30 AM</a><br><br>

The specific point I'm trying to address is whether the electrical grid -- and the modern industrial society that depends on it -- can be maintained in something like its present form on renewable energy.

You might have read that CO2 emissions this year are on track to be significantly below last year's, because demand destruction is cutting into the consumption of fossil fuels. The only reason the global economy appears to be growing these days is the mass production of imaginary wealth by way of the financial industry -- subtract all the paper wealth being conjured up by government printing presses, the manufacture of derivatives and debt-backed securities, etc., etc., and the real global economy -- the economy of goods and services -- has been shrinking since 2007 at the latest. <br><br>I'm far from sure that motor vehicles worldwide will double by 2030 -- no doubt the auto industry would love that to happen, and has been promoting the concept, but as the economic consequences of climate change and resource depletion continue to accelerate, I think it's far more likely that we'll see fewer cars on the roads, fewer roads in drivable condition, and a great many other statistics of the same kind firmly in the red by 2030. <br><br>Nastarana, granted.

Reading this blog over the past several years has made me question a great many things about my lifestyle, and I struggle to make the "right" choices that are more sustainable and sane. However, travel is one that I have struggled with the most. <br><br>Out of all the technologies our society has access to, cheap and fast travel is the one that I think is the most valuable. This may seem counter-intuitive, but without that cheap travel, I probably wouldn't care about the environment at all. Growing up in the suburbs of Chicago, the only nature around was mowed ball fields. Urban development is totally complete in that part of the world. If my dad hadn't driven me to Canada every summer for a fishing trip during my youth, if my Uncle hadn't flown me out to California for my 18th birthday and taken me backpacking in the mountains, I probably would have majored in business and be an accountant right now instead of studying ecology and working in conservation and botany.<br><br>But I still take those energy intensive trips. Its a soul tonic, time spent in wild spaces is important to me. I struggle with the issue of having to drive, sometimes hours, to get to a wild place. Fortunately I finally found work in Denver and moved to Colorado, so wild places are a bit closer to home. I don't feel good about the gas I use to take these trips, but I'm not sure how I could give up on regularly pitching my tent near an alpine lake, drinking straight from a spring, botanizing, fishing, stumbling into elk and black bear, watching the alpenglow turn the rocks rose and gold, and so on. <br><br>So while I understand the regular attacks of others on SUV driving and jet-setting environmentalists, I'm not sure travel is an issue that can so easily be classified as crass consumerism. Considering transportation accounts for only 14% of global carbon dioxide emissions, I feel there are a lot bigger fish to fry. If all this makes me an evil, unrepentant hypocrite, then so be it.<br><br>In other words, at the very least, the people loading up the SUV to go skiing this winter are doing something outside and in the real world, using their bodies, feeling the wind, sun, and cold in a semi-wild place. It took experiencing what is at stake to make me care. The more people stay in cities, playing in virtual simulations of mountain ranges and forests the less likely we are to care what is happening.<br><br>An old neighbor of mine is a semi-professional mountaineer. He lives in a small cabin outside of Boulder. He grows a big garden, set up a rainwater catchment system, turned off the gas heater and uses just the fire place to keep the house warm (all the wood comes from his day job working for an arborist company), he rides his bike to work to and from town even in the winter. Yet once or twice a year he flies to Patagonia of the Himalaya to practice his craft in the high mountains. <br><br>Are we really ready to judge people like him so harshly?<br><br>I don't expect JMG to agree, I just would like to see a more nuanced conservation on this particular issue, often I get the sense that many of the commentators enjoy piling on with their noses turned up.<br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c3897704064561243157 title="comment permalink">12/28/15, 12:53 PM</a><br><br>

RMI shows the money math - we have more than we need and it's already baked into required power generation upgrades - it's cheaper to move to efficiency and renewables than to keep doing what we're doing - even when we disregard externalities and extinction. It appears from their calcs that we have the money, factory space, and materials required.<br><br>Looking into Germany's transition, one can see that they need electricity, hot water, space heating and cooling, transportation, and industrial heat/energy. They need it when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow. And the German people made clear by putting their bodies on the line that they didn't want fossil or nuclear power in the mix. On a macro scale, they are converting excess energy to hydrogen and also pulling CO2 from the air to synthesize methane. Both can be stored in the existing national natural gas grid. They have enough storage available to provide more than six months of power to cover all energy consumers even if all of their renewables drop offline entirely. On a micro level, individual towns are planting a couple of wind turbines, covering a couple of barn roofs with PV, and installing biomethane digesters (all owned collectively, most being used in place of retirement investments in the stock markets, and all returning much better profits than 'conventional' investments). Towns are able to provide all their building heating (most is radiant, and supplied from a central boiler fired from their methane, from biomass, or from heat recovered from the diesel generators converted to run methane), all their hot water, and more than twice the electricity they need - which is exported on the power grid. They can do this because a standard German house uses about 1/3 the energy of a similar house in the US, and their push to retrofit to PassivHaus standards cuts their energy use to about 10% of our average. They started with efficiency and by re-arranging and re-combining the puzzle pieces to re-define the problem.<br><br><br>I think we have enough time available so that we can get completely off fossil fuels in about 25 years, but don't think Americans have the will, unfortunately. Yes, that hurts to write. The part I don't know about is whether we still have the physical resources available to complete any of the transitions as they're written and I haven't yet found that info.<br><br>Thanks for the time, space, and ideas.<br>Andy<br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c4743680369018608208 title="comment permalink">12/28/15, 2:07 PM</a><br><br>

I love the sound of a coal mine, slowly shedding steel into the desert. On one side living simply as is the norm in Denita (The Navajo Reservation) has made me much less worried about the collapse of western technological support. I felt pretty comfortable in the simple structure, and realized that except for one electric light there was little that my daily pattern needed.<br><br>On the other hand the implication of climate change was all the more daunting. While following the sheep through their grazing wash I contemplated how the land would respond to rarer and more massive weather regime that is anticipated if climate change goes as current signs imply. Fewer larger storms would devastate the dry lands of the South West. I think that encouraging hyper drought tolerant trees like pinyon and juniper could mitigate it, also by slowing water where it enters the top of washes and draws might minimize the rapid erosion which otherwise would devastate the land. Still the work needed to be done is immense, even in more hospitable lands than the Black Mesa found in more temperate parts of the South West.<br><br>I don't know what can be done, one thing I will try doing is spreading basic mycology skills. It is a fairly water efficient way to produce protein rich foods from biomass that under current practices is currently burned. Also, it is clear from the history research done at Mesa Verde that deforstation is a major contributor to previous civilization collapse in the region. Using glass and metal, abundant in our era, solar thermal can decrease the per capita wood usage considerably, if certain techniques are disseminated. With the weather keeping my activities indoors I have been studying solar concentration and hope to implement some experiments on that front. Also dew harvesting of green house exhaust might be viable on properties with limited water rights. Small farmers need to be able to maximally use each drop of water, because out irrigation systems are likely to be major sources of conflict.<br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c677283669814282652 title="comment permalink">12/28/15, 5:50 PM</a><br><br>

We don't need batteries to convert PV DC into grid- (and appliance-) compatible 115V AC. We just need a "power inverter", similar in concept to the little box that you might plug into a car's 12VDC outlet to produce 115 VAC, so you could re-convert it into the special DC voltage needed to charge a laptop computer's battery while driving. A PV system only needs to include batteries if you want to keep using stored electrical power when the grid is down and the sky is dark. And if you want to do that, by the way, you don't need a PV system to charge your batteries; you could charge from the grid just as well.<br><br>In my system, each panel puts out about 20-40V DC (under useful levels of sunshine). But "power" is voltage x current, and "energy" is the integral of power with respect to time. (If words like "integral" (and "derivative") aren't in your vocabulary, they should be, in order to understand systems of all kinds.) The more current that you try to draw, the lower the output voltage you see, so there's a trade-off. To get maximum power from the panels, the ideal load is one that adjusts its demand for current so as to track the peak-power point even as the intensity of the sunshine changes.<br><br>Just converting the raw DC to 115V AC (two-phase) is relatively easy and efficient with modern electronics. Converting it in a way that ensures that power flows out of my house to share with my neighbors takes some fancy control, but doesn't waste much power. Each of my panels, in fact, converts the raw DC to AC and then back to a standard DC voltage before it leaves the roof, so that the main grid-interface power inverter always has 600V DC to work with. The individual panel converters independently track the peak-power point for each panel (for example, one panel is shadowed by a vent stack part of the day, so we don't try to get power out of it then).<br><br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c6201700699315456170 title="comment permalink">12/28/15, 6:28 PM</a><br><br>

Regarding methane, the Semiletov and Shakhova work hasn't accumulated enough data to state with any certainty that methane releases in the Arctic are either new or increasing. As I mentioned, measurements show that methane increases in the winter, not the summer, so I'm not sure that hypothesis is (yet) correct. I also checked for research using rubber ducks. There was something like that done in 2008 but I don't think not finding any of a few rubber ducks out in open sea is conclusive proof that the meltwater is collecting in the interior (indeed, I'm not sure that such an amount transferring from above the ice to under the ice would not already have had a profound effect, though I haven't really thought that through).

It was sponsored by multinational french bank BNP Parisbas and as you who saw the film also noticed a lot of apple gizmo stuff. Most of my fellow directors from all over the world didn´t really have any clue about what climate change and the long term effects of it really have. The film that won the competition portrayed a french couple kissing on the beach who after their kiss had to put their gas masks back on....<br>However, this film festival is on every year and have different topics every time. Climate Change was just this years subject due to the climate summit. The people working with the festival are really nice film loving people who do what they have to to make the festival going! Make collaborations with multi national companies to pay for the whole lot. That´s how it works. I wrote a lot about the cynicism of the thing on my blog.

Our best day in December produced almost 12.5 kWh, and the worst (so far) about 1 kWh. Now, 1 kWh may not seem like a lot, in terms of price ($0.15, from the grid), but if you think about the things we use AA dry-cell batteries for, such as portable radios and flashlights, getting 1000 of them in a day doesn't sound so bad. <br><br>However, I estimate that it would take about 20 Wh to reheat refrigerated pre-cooked oatmeal for breakfast, which explains why I do not use AA batteries for cooking! (500g (two servings), from 4C to 38C)<br><br>On the other hand, if I can use free solar energy to heat a 10 lb. barbel plate to 100 deg. C, and keep it in a perfectly insulated box overnight, I'd have 37 Wh of heat to warm the oatmeal with in the morning. (allowed to cool from 100C to 40C while warming breakfast).<br><br>One response to the daily variation in energy availability from solar power is to arrange consumption to "make hay while the sun shines". Historically, time-sensitive pricing has been intended to steering industrial users away from peak consumption periods to match the level power output of coal and nuclear generators. In the future, we might see time-sensitive pricing steering heavy usage toward the sunny hours of sunny days, when power is (hypothetically) plentiful.<br><br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c9076268793735039478 title="comment permalink">12/29/15, 11:19 AM</a><br><br>

It came with three 2'x3' panels, an inverter, and a 12 v battery (cost about $200 total with no govt subsidies but lots of externalities). I have the panels up on the roof and in mostly sunny Napa Valley it keeps my phone and other electronics charged up (not on cloudy days). It Also runs a couple LED bulbs in the bathroom. Not grid tied so it can be used in emergency situations.

Many people are already collapsed, living in poverty or thereabouts, and can't afford jet travel, a car, or, if they do have a car, it's too old and unreliable to take on long road trips. So, it does seem extravagant to them. And considering JMG's admonition, "collapse now &amp; avoid the rush", we'll all probably be in that boat sooner rather than later after the next series of crises washes over us. Besides, when you jet off to El Capitan or Denali or wherever, you're not enjoying your biome/nature, but someone else's. Seems like Adrian and others in the Chicago area have mentioned lots of natural treasures in their area and enjoy their biome. Not too mention the Great Lakes. I think it's a case of the "grass is always greener". I live near the Appalachian foothills, and you couldn't ask for a richer natural biome. Even in Central KY, there's the KY River palisades and numerous streams &amp; waterways. Learning to relocalize and appreciate your own areas natural wealth &amp; diversity is part of the process. My grandparents &amp; great-grandparents did without frequent travel &amp; lived locally, and I'm learning to do the same. Besides, there's always those trains JMG speaks of. I think JMG sets a great example by living carless in a poor community.<br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c8636961526065118791 title="comment permalink">12/29/15, 2:17 PM</a><br><br>

I'm clearly conflicted on it myself as an active "outdoors sports" enthusiast. I tend to go in mental circles. <br><br>In response to your first post, I should have chosen my words more carefully. Instead I would say that out of all the non-essential privileges that current technology grants us, cheap travel is among the most worthy. It certainly ranks ahead of hoverboards and ipads at any rate. <br><br>The trouble is no matter how I look at it, I know it is not sustainable. It is clearly a privileged activity. Yet I can't manage to quash my desire to explore the forests, mountains, grasslands, and deserts and see as much of this beautiful planet as I can. I'm also not sure how sustainable urban living is for the human animals emotional and physical needs. <br><br>I once tried to have a big adventure via alternative transit. Several years ago a friend and I took a train from Chicago to Sacramento. It took three days for that journey, another day of buses and trains to reach Yosemite Valley and start a three week hike on the John Muir Trail. It worked in the end, but it ate over a week of the trip just on trains/buses. With the income we lost from missing an extra week of work due to transit, it wound up much more expensive than flying despite the train tickets being dirt cheap. <br><br>So maybe it was more ecologically sustainable but it was also more economically difficult. Being cheap and fast, airplanes create economic parity for travelers. Access to travel for more classes of people beyond the elite is definitely a benefit of our crumbling modern age. There is also a big difference between a few hundred people flying coach together, and one person making the same flight on a private jet.<br><br>Beyond that I'm not sure what else to add, I've made about as much of an argument defending high-energy travel as I can. I'm fully aware I'm on shaky ground. <br><br>A last note. Sometimes I just want to absolve myself of any responsibility. Being part of the under thirty crowd of Archdruid fans, I have the distinct sense that this civilization played its hand before I was even born (Peak oil looming, climate change locked in, etc). <br><br>If my elders failed to act and build a sustainable world why should it be my responsibility? I know the only real answer to that is "Who else is gonna do it?" so I'm trying to see my way through these complicated topics as best I can.<br><br><br><br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c681595147514907248 title="comment permalink">12/29/15, 4:23 PM</a><br><br>

So please don't slip into the glib, facile generational blaming. <br><br>And no, the only answer isn't 'who else is going to do it'. Thought that's certainly a good part of it. But just as important is 'how am I going to look myself in the mirror every day and have some self respect, now that I know what's going on?'. And 'how am I going to sleep at night, pretending that I don't?'.<br><br>Your elders, and my elders (I'm 60), and their elders, etc. ad infinitum all failed to build sustainable systems. This has been coming on a long time. The political system handed the rudder over to the money power (capital) generations ago, and simply abdicated responsibility. We are all victims, and it's far from over yet.<br><br>So eat, drink, and be merry if you can. But you know what you know.

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, most national parks in the western US as well as some regional parks had railroad service to the gates and in some cases to lodges in the interior. The railroads promoted ecotourism to the middle and upper classes as an alternative to European travel, and built many of the grand lodges in the parks, such as the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park. The working class could not afford the time or the money for this kind of travel, but some middle class people could. Last year, there was a PBS series called Great Lodges of the National Parks or something like that, which covered the tie in between the railroads, the building of lodges in the parks, and the promotion of domestic travel to wilderness locations.<br><br>Local attractions like Mount Tamalpais in Marin County, CA were also served by passenger rail. All of this went away when the federal highway system was developed.<br><br>Something else that is nearly forgotten is a New Deal programs that established federally owned and operated campgrounds all over the United States. These were intended to make it possible for ordinary families to afford an inexpensive healthful vacation in the woods. Over the years, nearly all of these campgrounds were sold off or transferred to state control. One still in federal hands is Camp David, a vacation retreat for Presidents and their guests, to which the public has no access. Perhaps the last one still being operated as a campground is the Mendocino Woodlands, which is now a group camp owned by the State of California but managed by a consortium of non-profit clubs and organizations.<br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c5802597242652763221 title="comment permalink">12/29/15, 7:04 PM</a><br><br>

Maybe because I'm 54, one of those dastardly oldsters who had the gall to be born 20-some odd years before you - because of that, I remember when cross-country or global travel was not a "non-essential", but could only be categorized as a luxury. I just can't bring myself to viewing it as anything other than a luxury - now or ever, no matter how cheap Jet-Blue appears to be to a first world middle class explorer. I think that's true whether your destination is a pristine wilderness, an urban historical/cultural site or trashy, glitzy trip to Vegas or Disneyland - they're all luxuries. In real terms - they cost a LOT!<br><br> I certainly hope you do not mean to imply you would have no concern for the fate of those pristine wildernesses unless you could personally enjoy them, (without missing out on too much work.) I would hope you'd agree that those pristine wildernesses are worth their existence with or without you gracing their presence. Since I was a child, two of the places I've really yearned to see with my very own eyes are the African Veldt and the Siberian forests. At this point it's really a given that I won't ever see them in person, but I still want them to exist, for the flora and fauna to thrive and continue. If my not flying, (or even caravanning) in to glimpse them personally adds a tiny bit to their prospects of continuance - I'm good with that. <br><br>As to your last question: "...Why should it be my responsibility?" I would again, quibble with your answer, only as being incomplete. My answer would be that whatever you decide to do or not do: 'You're in it. You have to live with it'. In the same way we all each individually have to live with and make the best of what we were handed, both good and bad. <br><br>There is no moral high or low ground here, so IMHO, any blame on prior or subsequent generations is self-gratifying wasted effort. I mean, if it motivates you or makes you feel better to blame the boomers, sure, go ahead, but it doesn't change anything. At 54 I just missed out on the best benefits of the 'boomers' - a tail-end baby boomer? A 'Silent Generational'? Meh, I coulda had it better. I'm sure those a bit older than myself could if they chose to - blame their own previous generation for the devastation of WW2? for inventing the bomb? We could all play this game.<br><br>As our esteemed host has explained a number of times, all civilizations follow a pattern - and we're following it. Blaming it on the baby boomers for not being far-sighted enough to forestall this collapse that they may or may not live through is IMHO, not only pointless(see above), but asking more than the average human has shown to have the capacity for. All of those preceding risen and collapsed civilizations attest to this. In their place - you would have done the same. It's just human nature. None of us are above it.<br><br>When a storm is coming - don't waste time shaking your fist at the sky or railing on your parents for having given birth to you without your consent. If you want to ride out that storm and live, you'd be best off just battening down the hatches. <br><br>Good luck.<br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c8234165936186893479 title="comment permalink">12/29/15, 8:23 PM</a><br><br>

You would think that it would be obvious to all that the sun does not shine at night, but alas - it must be me, for I am confused! :-)! Hehe! If only it wasn’t serious…<br><br>73'F would be hot for a late June day here, let alone up in your part of the world. The weather has been so extreme this year across much of the continent and also the elsewhere on this planet that I'm inclined to believe that things have gone awry with the climate and whilst it may possibly return to normal for a while, it probably won't stay normal and expected for very long before returning to even more extremes...<br><br>The funny thing about people throwing around terms like renewables and eco-houses is that I've given them a good go down here and they're not cheap and they're not easy and there is very little official support for such things. Plus it takes years of living with this stuff to understand all of the quirks and limitations of the systems. I reckon they fill the role of the thought stopper. I think future renewables will look more like bees wax candles whilst eco-houses will look more like one room timber log and bark shacks.<br><br>Rolf Harris who made famous "Tie me Kangaroo sport" is in disgrace too, and for good reason!<br><br>Hi August,<br><br>I know and totally 100% agree with you. I run a small 12V system with 200Ah battery (2.4kW) and a single 200W panel and it will run lights, garden lights, water pump, and radio but not much else as my experience with it is exactly the same as yours. It is good, in fact actually it is great, but it is not a fossil fuel generator. Not by a long shot. I do hope that no one is pinning their hopes on solar PV. I must sort out a second hand ham radio and license. So much to do...<br><br>Hi Carl,<br><br>Good for you for taking the initiative and seeing how this stuff works in the real world. Respect.<br><br>Hi Nastarana,<br><br>Honestly, I used to feel the same as you do about the service charges for utilities as I too was a very low user. Respect to you too for that. I changed my mind about this issue after I had provide, install and pay for all of the infrastructure that I now exist with – and not one of the systems supplies me with the volume of output that can occasionally be required in a connected home. I dream of access to town water supplies! And I can tell you this frightening truth – your regular connection service charges are very cheap indeed when compared to supplying your own infrastructure.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c3910302654552833898 title="comment permalink">12/30/15, 2:56 AM</a><br><br>

They are very different, and often confused; in the general public conversation and even on this and other energy related blogs.<br><br>It is pretty clear that PV and Wind will not allow BAU to continue. At least as far as someone jumping into their SUV commuting 40 miles to work, stopping off for a quick latte on the way in, stopping at a store and picking up some fresh strawberries from half way around the world out of season on the way home, and doing it again day after day, by the millions. That sort of extravagant use of concentrated energy for mere convenience is going away. Maybe not tomorrow, but more and more so as time moves on.<br><br>That said, RE can and does provide a new source of concentrated energy without many of the problems of the old fossil and nuke sources. Not necessarily a drop in replacement with no other changes required, but a viable alternative for some (likely lower) level of concentrated energy. <br><br>It is important, as JMG has pointed out, not to fall into the trap of thinking of the future in extremes. Neither the continuation of BAU nor the apocalypse are the most likely outcomes. Change will happen, often at several levels of the system at the same time; this enables a much greater range of possible outcomes than the projections which analyze from a single (or no) variables changing.<br><br>Changes will happen. Some (many?) may have to be dragged kicking and screaming to those changes, but none the less they will occur.

Many people have been evacuated. A number of those are not insured because their properties have been flooded before.

The Environment Agency is saying that the flood defences have proved inadequate, in that they worked up to a certain level but were overtopped by more water than expected.

Part of this at least means that it has not been bitingly cold at least with temperatures around 12C.<br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c2022892700347571821 title="comment permalink">12/31/15, 2:17 AM</a><br><br>

Your words, and that of Richard Heinberg and the late Michael Ruppert pushed me to start talking with folks, networking, and thinking about how to address peak oil and climate change on a local level. Studying and storytelling the Eddas and other Norse and Germanic myths, reading your deconstruction of the Myth of Progress as well as Narrative Medicine and Coyote Medicine by Dr. Lewis Mehl-Madrona helped quite a bit in solidifying the power of narratives in my mind. Doing this helped me not only move away from the overculture's dominant narratives, but to envision my own. Being able to weave stories, first with myself, and then with my loved ones, and folks who are interested in coming together and *doing* something locally.<br><br>While we're not yet at the place to start raising food, vegetable and animal on land as we would like, or living in the manner we would like to, we're getting things in place so we can do that, and when we launch, to make it a good one. My wife and I were gifted with two workshops, one in round timber framing, and the other in how to make our own rocket stove with cob and plaster. We've been gardening for the last several years, and this next looks to be promising if last year's growth was any indication. <br><br>Home and hearth is the way forward for us, and the folks we are coming into alliance with to make all these things happen are likewise minded. Thank you for helping plant seeds that are starting to take root. Gods willing, we'll have something to show in a year or so.<br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c8938652075219685356 title="comment permalink">12/31/15, 2:38 AM</a><br><br>

I am building a 400 sf earth bermed home and collecting rainwater on the insulated roof. I use less electricity all the time, moving toward no electric use at all. It has passive solar windows on the south and a northwest exit door for cool air. I am building raised hugelkultur beds and have a greenhouse 1/3 finished for winter vegetables. Two large south windows are greenhouse windows too. Chickens. Bees this summer... no farm pesticides near. Now I am retired I make my errands in town 1 day per week. No debt. I can only suggest that we be the change we want to see. I sign petitions, write letters, still. Nothing is as effective as changing my own life. Nothing is as fun, either. I had solar panels on my old place... just more manufacturing to keep manufacturing in place. Here I am on grid and will keep it so during my transition.

As I was reading some posts here in discussion, I remembered to a recent news from Badgersett research group from Minnesota. They breed hazels, chestnuts and pecans for 30-40 years. As I am trying to establish a garden here in central Europe somewhere in between "agroforestry" and "woody agriculture" as proposed by P. Rutter from Badgersett, I read their news time to time.<br>This particular news was considered so profound that they made a press release on that.<br>As it is very unpleasant and important one to the theme, I am posting it here: http://badgersettresearch.blogspot.cz/2015/12/the-global-warming-grinch.html<br><br>By the way, we experienced extraordinary warm fall here too. Only this weekend it started to freeze, with spring daily temperatures even a week back (even yesterday I was tilling some beds). But almost no snow yet and soil water reserve is extraordinary low too - despite it rained quite a lot (more than average) in november and december (it is a deficit from last winter, when there was practically no snow, leading to quite severe drought in summer with lowered harvests; we are not used to such droughts). I plan improving water retention on my piece of land in various ways, but I am agro-beginner (5 years by now) and it really is a long run.<br><br><a href=too-little-too-late.html#c408461097358472452 title="comment permalink">1/4/16, 12:54 AM</a><br><br>
