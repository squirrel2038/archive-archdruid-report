<div class=MsoNormal>
This is the tenth installment of an exploration of some of the possible futures discussed on this blog, using the toolkit of narrative fiction. Our narrator catches a train for the agricultural hinterlands of the Lakeland Republic, and learns some of the reasons why the Republic is so hard to invade. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
***********</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The phone rang at eight a.m. sharp the next morning. I was in the bathroom, trying to get my electric shaver to give me a shave half as good as the one I got at the barbershop, and failing; I turned the thing off, put it down, and got to the phone on the third ring. “Hello?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Mr. Carr? Melanie Berger. We’ve got everything lined up for your trip today. Can you be at the train station by nine o’clock?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Sure thing,” I said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Good. Your tickets will be waiting for you, and Colonel Tom Pappas will meet you there. You can’t miss him; look for a wheelchair and a handlebar mustache.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The wheelchair didn’t sound too promising—I had no idea what kind of accommodations counties in the Lakeland Republic’s lower tiers made for people with disabilities—but I figured Meeker’s people knew what they were doing. “I’ll do that.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“You’ll be back Saturday evening,” Berger said then. “The president would like to see you again Monday afternoon, if you’re free.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’ll put it on the schedule,” I assured her; we said the usual, and I hung up. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It took me only a few minutes to pack for the trip, and then it was out the door, down the stairs, and through the lobby to the street to wave down a taxi. As I got out onto the sidewalk, a kid with a bag of rolled newspapers hanging from one shoulder turned toward me expectantly and said, “Morning <i>Blade</i>? ‘Nother satellite got hit.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That sounded worth the price of a paper; I handed over a bill and a couple of coins, got the paper in return, thanked the kid, and went to the street’s edge. A couple of minutes later I was sitting in a two-wheel cab headed for the train station, listening to the clip-clop of the horse’s hooves ahead and reading the top story on the newspaper’s front page. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The kid who’d sold me the paper hadn’t been exaggerating. A chunk of the <i>Progresso IV</i> satellite that got taken out by space junk a week before had plowed into a big Russian telecommunications satellite during the night, spraying fragments at twenty thousand miles an hour across any number of midrange orbits. Nothing else had been hit yet, but the odds of a full-blown Kessler syndrome had just gone up by a factor I didn’t want to think about. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Aside from the fact itself, only one thing caught my attention in the article: a comment from a professor of astronomy at the University of Toledo, mentioning that his department was calculating the orbits of as many fragments as they’d been able to track. I didn’t know a lot about astronomy, but I’d learned just enough that the thought of trying to work out an orbit using pen and paper made my head hurt. I wondered if they’d scraped together the money to buy a bootleg computer from a Chicago smuggling ring or something like that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d just about finished the first section of the paper when the taxi pulled up to the sidewalk in front of the train station. I paid the cabbie, stuffed the newspaper into my coat pocket, and headed inside. The big clock above the ticket counters said eight-thirty; there wasn’t much of a line, so by eight-forty I had my round trip ticket in an inner pocket and was heading through the doors marked Platform Four. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d just about gotten my bearings when I spotted a burly man in a wheelchair halfway down the platform. He turned around and saw me a moment later, made a little casual half-salute with one hand, and wheeled over to meet me. Berger hadn’t been kidding about the handlebar mustache; it was big, black, and curled at the tips. That and bushy eyebrows made up for the lack of a single visible hair anywhere else on his head. He was wearing the first hip-length jacket I’d seen anywhere in the Lakeland Republic, over an olive-drab military uniform. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Peter Carr?” he said. “I’m Tom Pappas. Call me Tom; everyone else does.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Pleased to meet you,” I said, shaking his hand. The guy had hands the size of hams and a grip that would put a gorilla to shame. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Melanie tells me you rattled the boss good and proper yesterday,” he said with a chuckle. “You probably know we’ve been getting a lot of semi-official visitors from outside governments since the borders opened. Of course they all want to know about our military. Care to guess how many of them asked about that right up front, to the President’s face?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I can’t be the only one,” I protested. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Not quite. Ever met T. Bayard Batchley?” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I burst out laughing. “Yes, I’ve met him. Don’t tell me he’s the only other.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Got it in one. Of course he blustered about it in the grand Texan style, and more or less implied that the entire army of the Republic of Texas was drooling over the prospect of invading us.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I shook my head, still laughing. “I bet. I was on a trade mission to Austin a while back, and we got a Batchley lecture to the effect that everyone in Philadelphia was going to starve to death if they didn’t get shipments of Texas beef that week.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Sounds about right.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The train came up to the platform just then, and the roar of the locomotive erased any possibility of further conversation for the moment. The conductor took our tickets and waved us toward one of the cars. I wondered how Pappas was going to climb the foot or so from the platform to the door, but about the time I’d finished formulating the thought, one of the car attendants popped out, grabbed a handle I hadn’t noticed under the step, and slid out a steel ramp. Pappas rolled up into the car, the attendant pushed the ramp back into its place, they said a few words to each other, and then Pappas wheeled his way over to a place at the back of the car, flipped one of the two seats up, and got a couple of tiedown straps fastened onto his chair by the time I’d followed him. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I took the seat next to him. “Do they have this sort of thing in all the trains here?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Wheelchair spots? You bet. We had a lot of disabled vets after the Second Civil War, of course, and got a bunch more in ‘49. That’s how I ended up in this thing—got stupid during the siege of Paducah, and took some shrapnel down low in my back.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The train filled up around us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“I’m sorry to hear that,” I said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Oh, it doesn’t slow me down that much.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The only complaint I’ve got is that I’m stuck in a desk job in Toledo now, instead of out there in the field.” He shook his head. “How much did they tell you about our military?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Here, or back home?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Either one.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Here, nothing. Back home—” I considered the briefings I’d been given, edited out the classified parts. “They’re pretty much baffled. We know you’ve got universal military service on the Swiss model, but no modern military tech at all—plenty of light infantry and field artillery, but no armor, no drones, no air force worth mentioning, and a glorified coast guard on the Great Lakes.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He nodded as the train lurched into motion. “That’s about right. And you’re wondering how we can get away with that.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“It’s a concern,” I said. “As I told President Meeker, we don’t want a failed state or a war zone on our western border.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Pappas laughed, as though I’d made a joke. “I bet. What if I told you that we’re less likely to end up that way than any other country on this continent?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I gave him a wry look. “You’d have to to some very fast talking to convince me of that. With that kind of armament, I don’t see how you could expect to defeat a country with a modern military.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“We don’t have to defeat them,” he said at once. “All we have to do is bankrupt them.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I stared at him. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“War’s not cheap,” he went on. “Modern high-tech warfare, square and cube that. Half the reason the old United States collapsed was the amount of money it poured into trying to stay ahead of everybody else’s military technology. I’m not going to ask you how much the Atlantic Republic has to pay each year for drones, robot tanks, helicopter gunships, cruise missiles, and the information systems you need to run all of it; you know as well as I do that it’s a big chunk of the national budget, and I’d be willing to make a bet that you have to skimp on the rest of your military budget to make up for it—meaning that your ordinary grunts don’t have the training or the morale they might have.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I didn’t answer. Outside the window, commercial buildings gave way to a residential neighborhood dotted with gardens and parks. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“So you’ve got a lot of money sunk in military hardware. Let’s say you guys decided to invade us.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That’s not going to happen,” I told him. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Just for example.” He waved the objection away with one massive hand. “You send in your drones and robot tanks and helicopter gunships, seize Toledo and wherever else your general staff thinks is strategic enough to merit it, and dump a bunch of infantry to hold onto those places. You’ve won, right? Except that that’s when the fun begins. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“All that light infantry and field artillery you mentioned—it’s still there, distributed all over the country, and it’s not dependent on any kind of central command.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>It’s got first-rate training, and most of the training is oriented to one thing and one thing only: insurgent operations. So thirty minutes after your drones cross the border, you’re dealing with a full-on, heavily armed insurgency with prepared positions and ample firepower, in every single county of the Lakeland Republic. However long you want to hold on, we can hold on longer, and every day of it costs you a lot more than it costs us. Oh, and a lot of the training our troops get focuses on taking out your high-tech assets with inexpensive munitions. So it’s the same kind of black hole the old United States kept getting itself into—no way to win, and the bills just keep piling up until you go home.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’m a little surprised you’re telling me all this,” I said after a moment.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Don’t be. We want people outside to know exactly what they’re up against if they invade.” He gestured out the window. “Check that out.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We were still in the residential part of Toledo, the same patchwork of houses, gardens, and little business districts I’d seen on the way from Pittsburgh, but something new cut across the landscape: a canal. It didn’t have water in it yet, and so I could see that the sides were lined with big slabs of concrete that must have been salvaged from a prewar freeway.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“We’re putting those in everywhere that the landscape permits,” Pappas said. “Partly that’s economic—canals are cheaper to run than any other transport—but it’s also military. You want to try to cross one of those in a tank, be my guest. There’s a lot of that sort of thing. Every county is its own military unit and builds bunkers, prepared positions, tank traps, you name it. Since we’re not interested in invading anybody else, we can put a lot of resources into that.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I decided to take a risk. “If you’re not interested in invading anybody else, why did your people put so much work into getting detailed topo maps of our territory back before the border opened?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The bushy eyebrows went up. “You know about that.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I nodded. “We got lucky.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Gotcha,” Pappas said. “Did you hear much about the other side of our dust-up with the Confederacy in ‘49?” I motioned for him to go on, and he grinned. “We sent teams across the border into their territory to mess with their infrastructure. Bridges, power lines, levees, you name it—anything that would raise the price tag. We even got a couple of teams onto Brazilian territory to do the same thing; we would have done more of that if the war hadn’t ended when it did.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“So it’s all about economics,” I said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Of course. You know how Clausewitz said that war’s a continuation of politics by other means? He got that half right. It’s also a continuation of economics—and the last guy standing is the one who can afford to keep fighting longest.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I nodded. Outside the window, the first of the farms and fields were coming into view, brown with stubble or green with cover crops for overwintering. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“All across this country,” Pappas said then, “we’ve got young men and women doing their two year stints in the army, and showing up for two weeks a year afterwards as long as they can still shoulder a gun—and there’s a good reason for that. This country got the short end of the stick for decades back before the Second Civil War, then got the crap pounded out of it during the fighting, and then—well, I could go on. We found out the hard way what happens when you let some jerk in a fancy white house a thousand miles away decide for you how you’re going to run your life. That’s why President Meeker’s not much more than a referee to ride herd on the parties in the legislature; that’s why each county makes so many of its own decisions by vote—and it’s why all the people you’re going to see tomorrow are putting a nice fall weekend into shooting at drones.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Is that what’s on the schedule for tomorrow?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
The bushy eyebrows went up again. “Melanie didn’t tell you?” Suddenly he chuckled, rubbed his big hands together. “Oh man. You’re going to get an education.”</div>

However, it's entirely possible that in the (real world) future the key technologies that make drones expensive today get cheaper in real terms for a while longer.<br><br>However, Pappas is right about the costs of invading. I can't find links, but some retired US generals have espoused the opinion that truly defeating ISIS would require occupying the entire Middle East with close to a million troops for ~25 years. Needless to say, this isn't economically feasible (not that it might not be tried on a half-baked scale). It's worth noting that after World War 2, the Allied occupation forces in Germany and Japan were quite large - and the average German or Japanese citizen was not particularly antagonistic towards their conquerors, because the postwar privations and indignities were so much less than what they suffered during the war - it wouldn't necessarily be the same in a place like the Lakeland republic where it seems like the government would generally be fairly well regarded and invading forces, even if they did not commit atrocities, would be universally despised.<br><br>In any case, I think the future of robots in war depends on how effectively the robots can be automated - transmission links, especially near real-time, high bandwidth ones like current military drones use are quite vulnerable against an advanced adversary - but onboard AI is not nearly so vulnerable - if it can be made to work.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-economics-by-other-means.html#c2943284192419959628 title="comment permalink">12/2/15, 5:28 PM</a><br><br>

<div class="avtb a_4fdf15" id=c8917754545220256949></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/16247618351725715844 rel=nofollow>Pinku-Sensei</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>So next week that will be the long-awaited drone shoot episode. I'm looking forward to it. It should be great fun.<br><br>As for the strategy described, it looks like what the U.S. ran into in Iraq and Afghanistan as implemented by Midwesterners pretending to be the Swiss. Even though the land is flat and open here, adding barriers like canals would make the country a lot less friendly to invaders. That will make the Swiss impersonation a little more convincing. On a related note, I'm surprised you didn't add in bicycle infantry, which you've mentioned as a use of appropriate technology in a deindustrializing future before.<br><br>Speaking of appropriate technology and the theme of the past few weeks' posts about the technology people use being a matter of choice and not necessity, I've run into two stories where well-meaning residents of the county where I live convincing people who had abandoned driving out of necessity into driving again by getting new cars. The first was <a href=http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2015/02/james-robertson-abcs-person-of-week.html rel=nofollow>James Robertson, ABC's Person of the Week</a> from February. He took a bus to the end of the line and then walked many miles to work and back, as his job did not pay enough for him to buy a car. A good Samaritan saw him walking the same route day after day and offered him a ride. When the driver found out about Robertson's situation, he told the local media about it and an online fundraiser was set up to buy Robertson a new car. He ended up getting so much money that he moved out of Detroit into the suburbs to be closer to work and live in a safer neighborhood.<br><br>That story repeated itself last week, when <a href=http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2015/12/tony-cyclist-repeats-story-of-detroits.html rel=nofollow>a man named Tony was biking to work in a snowstorm</a>. A car salesman saw him and offered him and his bike a ride, first to work, then to look at a van. The salesman then set up an online fundraiser himself to get money for the van. It worked and Tony now has a lightly used van. The car salesman also made a sale for his dealership. Win-win, except for all the externalities.<br><br>In both cases, the media spun the events as heartwarming human-interest stories. While they were successes of charity, both incidents displayed the failure of metro Detroit to provide adequate public transportation. The response also sent a message that Americans think that car dependence is a virtue, not a vice. They also enforced the use of the prevailing level of technology, although the recipients were willing.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-economics-by-other-means.html#c8917754545220256949 title="comment permalink">12/2/15, 5:55 PM</a><br><br>

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c6811205704482894954></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/03641077881785789683 rel=nofollow>pygmycory</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Interesting. Basically, Lakeland is making itself too expensive to hold to be worth invading. That seems a useful strategy for less powerful countries. It might be a better one for Canada than the current 'let's have a smallish military that helps out the world superpower with their project-de-jour.' <br><br>Honestly, I don't think our dropping a few bombs on Syria or training some locals in warfare the western way makes much of a difference in world events one way or the other. It's expensive and pointless, and I don't think our military is capable of defending against either Russia or the USA should they decide to invade us someday.<br><br>Because the vast majority of Canada's population is in urban centers within a couple of hundred km of the southern border with the US, the Canadian winter isn't much defense. It's a very different situation from Russia defending itself from an invader from the west.<br><br>Not that I really expect the USA to attack Canada in the near future.<br><br>Russia? I sure hope the whole mess in Syria doesn't turn into open warfare between Nato and Russia. Canada doesn't have much of a military presence in the North compared to Russia, and the arctic islands would be very vulnerable to changing hands in a war if Russia wanted them. Presumably in a world-war type situation Russia would be very busy fighting the rest of Nato, but those islands would be an easy target.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-economics-by-other-means.html#c6811205704482894954 title="comment permalink">12/2/15, 5:58 PM</a><br><br>

Harper's Ferry, of course, was an old industrial hub, using the power of the Shenandoah to power all sorts of workshops. <br><br>Do you think it's likely that, after/during collapse, that we will have the ability to bring back the canals and the water-powered industries we had? As I understand Harper's Ferry's history, it was the repeated destruction from flooding that led them to turn away from water power to electricity. Is it likely that someone will have the will to re-cast the parts needed to bring back those technologies while we still have the technologies to do that easily? <br><br>I certainly don't see the city govt doing it - all the very nice museum sites in Harper's Ferry are demos running on electricity, and climbing thru' the brick ruins of the old power plant on Virginus Island ... gives me no clues at all.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-economics-by-other-means.html#c8215577240967297063 title="comment permalink">12/2/15, 6:42 PM</a><br><br>

Oh this is a good touch! I look forward eagerly to the next installment. And whatever became of handlebar mustaches? Once, years ago, I saw a well-dressed gentleman in a wealthier part of central Tokyo with a nice mustache. How distinctive that was! The Japanese do not like standing out, and a lot of the guys would only have a skimpy one, so you rarely see mustaches here.<br>I kept stopping and thinking as I read this. Two days ago I wrote out an outline for the Meriga Project fiction I've been thinking about. That came to 17 short chapters. My initial idea was about a page each, like a diary, with what I was estimating at ten entries, but there is so much background information and so many essential details. Good grief, I wanted a short story, but it will turn out a bit longer. Like Retrotopia, this will be about a well-led community with a realistic approach and humane ideals, accounting for Neeonjin's future strength.<br>And, a week ago, I mentioned to a certain activist, tangential to last week's discussion, an idea I'd gotten while working on the fourth section of my first novel, that just begged to be not a mere mention, but an entire novel in itself, and she liked the idea, so last week that started spilling out too, and it appears a neck to neck race with the Meriga Project piece (that I'm calling "Empress of the Sun"). It's in diary form, so I can set it aside, but it occurs to me I need to call a "sabbatical" if I am going to get these three works out. Because I'm the breadwinner, I can't call off my work. But as the Dragon King* told me a couple of years ago, I had better stop wasting my time, and I know exactly what he meant. So I will take a sabbatical from the news and buy a screen that I can use to block off my husband's constantly flashing TV. I promise to drop in here (perhaps Sundays), but not try to read all the comments, though they are so excellent.<br>*(The only mention I could find of him was here: http://candobetter.net/files/The%20Realization%20of%20Human%20Happiness%20CBD.pdf and a worthwhile piece in itself, but another search turned up this: http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1077 with interesting background on the Kompira Shrine itself and its connection to the Dragon King, known among esoteric practitioners as a particularly responsive deity.)<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-economics-by-other-means.html#c8841969993920545258 title="comment permalink">12/2/15, 7:02 PM</a><br><br>

What if the world military powers get wise to this also? For example Brazil decides it is to expensive to invade, but at the same time Lakeland represents a dangerous example which should not be replicated. Based upon this it decides that the most economical way wreck the experiment, and send a clear to anyone thinking of trying it themselves, is to bomb the built up infrastructure, so that Lakeland has no working canals, nor railroads, nor manure power plants etc. Possibly not as much of an issue in tier 1 counties, but still.

On the one hand, people who are being bombed don't generally run out and embrace the values of the people doing the bombing; on the other, there's the risk of blowback -- the Brazilian government will certainly be thinking of those teams of saboteurs who came ashore in the middle of the night during the war, and considering the economic consequences if the Lakeland Republic threw everything it had into causing Brazil as much pain as possible, one well-placed lump of plastique at a time.<br><br>Michael, glad to see that the meme's catching on! <br><br>Genevieve, that's because the US has never tried to take on a nation that's done what I have the Lakeland Republic doing, and prepped a massive insurgency in advance. The US has been exquisitely careful only to pick on countries that can't fight back, precisely because the economic and political consequences if the bubble of American invulnerability ever gets pricked are too vast to risk. <br><br>Ien, thank you! <br><br>Mitzi, exactly. You can also do a huge amount if you combine well-trained brains with simple analog calculators such as slide rules, which is what they're doing at the University of Toledo's astronomy department in the story. Computing orbital trajectories with a good log-log rule is straightforward -- that's what NASA used to put the Apollo astronauts on the Moon, after all. <br><br>Iangagn, I'll consider that. I'm planning on a Callenbachian utopian novel to start with, to get the ideas out there, but we'll see how it goes. <br><br>RepubAnon, the same way they do everything else: make it too expensive to be worthwhile. The lack of infrastructure makes a lot of the tech useless anyway, you know. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Sunny Lord, infrastructure has always been a target of insurgencies: blowing up bridges, taking out telegraph or telephone lines, etc. What makes things different these days is merely that there's so much more infrastructure to target. I have no idea whether the Taliban is thinking in those terms, though; by and large they've seemed very unimaginative so far. <br><br>Misty, a hundred well-trained special forces personnel who knew exactly what to hit and how to do it could bring the US economy to its knees in a matter of weeks. We're hugely vulnerable to an infrastructure-targeting strategy, not least because the US has centralized its infrastructure to an idiotic degree. <br><br>Ondra, we'll get to that! The Lakeland Republic actually has a deterrent strategy in place, which will be mentioned in a later episode.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-economics-by-other-means.html#c1602101900227399211 title="comment permalink">12/2/15, 10:41 PM</a><br><br>

The weapon- and supplyselling lobbies were too strong. They do not care for occupying and keeping a country. They care for selling weapons, ammunition and bandaids. And the more the better. And piling up bills still is not stopping the US for instance at continuing to do so. Yes, it is costing the taxpayers dearly, both in cash as in blood.<br>Can a country like lakeland be defeated by military means? Yes, but at tremendous cost to both sides; one paying heavily for the utter destruction of the other.<br>But in the end the highly motivated guerillas will prevail, simply because the destruction caused by the invader only fuels their will to fight. Something every invading army in military history had to learn the hard way. It might take 5 years, 50 or more. But by that time the invaded country would be left in ruins and its remaining inhabitants deprived of many necessities.

Probably a combination of both.

Overreaction. 10000 grunts are deployed on national territory for prevention of further terrorist attacks. I don't see how this provide additional security. Only a theater of security I would say.

We'll get to see a few of the measures that the Lakeland Republic uses to protect itself against the sort of strategy you have in mind as we proceed. <br><br>Dagnarus, to begin with, put yourself into the mindset of the Brazilian head of state. Would you see the Lakeland Republic as a viable economic model that others would emulate, or a bizarre anomaly where no sane person would live -- after all, you can't even get a veepad signal there! As for why terrorists haven't targeted US economic infrastructure, I frankly have no idea. I don't think it's the difficulty of the thing -- it really would be frighteningly easy. It may be that, like most of the rest of us, would-be terrorists don't think in terms of whole systems and so don't notice the vulnerabilities. <br><br>Ron, the US can still get away with bombing an assortment of Third World locales because it's willing to run up debts that will never be paid off. Lacking that expedient, this country would be stone cold broke...as it probably will be in due time. As for high-tech weapons, my thought is that some of those, of declining quality and soaring cost, will still be present in industrial-world militaries for another fifty to seventy-five years, though how functional they actually are will be a state secret: you can still threaten with a technology you can't use, so long as nobody calls your bluff. <br><br>Leo, I recall that article! The situation is if anything much worse, since electrical grids are much more integrated than they used to be, and just-in-time delivery systems mean that there are no spares on this continent. <br><br>Kim, you can download free slide rule manuals from <a href=http://www.sphere.bc.ca/test/2learning.html rel=nofollow>Slide Rule Universe</a>, <a href=http://sliderule.ozmanor.com/man/man-download.html rel=nofollow>Greg's Slide Rules</a>, and <a href=http://tinas-sliderules.me.uk/Slide%20Rules/SlideRuleBooks.html rel=nofollow>Tina's Slide Rules</a>.

The British army of the Boer War was still a ruthless force. They put the Boer civilians (families included) in concentration camps (they invented the very concept) and let a quarter of the Boer population starve. The Boers lost the war.<br><br>During WWII, France was occupied by the Wehrmacht. The occupation government seized large parts of the crops and sent them to Germany. The local population survived on rations. Just survived: in my hometown, in the Paris region, the residents of the local asylum actually starved, because their rations were not sufficient. Who distributed the rations? The occupation government. The "Résistance" fighters put up a gallant fight, but they were no match for the Wehrmacht and the SS. When you can starve the people, they can't win against you. Stalin knew it, and implemented the policy, as the Ukrainians learned the hard way.<br><br>Suppose that the army invading Lakeland systematically destroys infrastructure (including industrial infrastructure), starves the population, and settles colonists in villages whose population has been previously expelled or killed (as was the Nazi plan in Eastern Europe). What would the Lakelanders do? Had not the Red Army defeated the Wehrmacht by sheer quantity, of men and hardware, half of present day Poland would be populated by Germans. Himmler even had a plan to settle Danes (a Germanic nation) in Eastern Europe.<br><br>The more money is spent on the US military, the less efficient it becomes, but that's because the US economy has become as flawed as the Soviet economy was, as the F35 fiasco shows. When the real objective of the economic and political actors involved is to earn as much money as possible, and nobody is worried about making an inferior product (which the F35 is), then you get a very expensive inferior product.<br><br>I have a hunch that the wars of the 21st century will be wars for resources, and the Swiss / Lakeland strategy won't work. Look at Syria. The Sunnis are plagued by an exceptional drought, and revolted. For complex reasons, the dominant force among the rebels is ISIL, whose cadre is largely made of former officers of secularist Saddam Hussein's army: circumstances always trump ideology. Who's having some success so far? The Russians, who've begun to carpet bomb rebel strongholds. Bashar Al-Assad will have won when the last Sunni rebel is either dead under tons of debris, or living in a refugee camp somewhere in another country. It may work for Assad. If it doesn't, nothing else will.<br><br>It will be interesting to see what happens in Yemen. That's a country which imports 90% of the food it consumes. My hunch: soon we'll see Yemeni refugees everywhere, millions of them, while the population of Yemen decreases to fit resources. It will be ugly, but we won't see it, because no journalists will be allowed to film it, and the Saudis know very well how to control the flow of information.<br><br>Lakeland looks like a Utopia. There are horses in Lakeland. A horse does the work of ten men, but it eats as much food as four men. Human population always rises as much as resources allow, as you know. Cheap petroleum allowed industrial societies to replace their horses by four times as many humans. When cheap petroleum ends, we'll still have those humans (including yours truly) who wouldn't be there if we still had horses. But with cheap petroleum gone, we'll need the horses back again, to pull the plows, transport freight, etc. But we'll also need all the land to feed the large populations we have (it probably won't suffice, incidentally). We'll have to do without horses. Survive on gardening rather than farming. Those of us who'll have access to a large enough garden, that is. It won't be everybody.<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-economics-by-other-means.html#c1818517746057430292 title="comment permalink">12/3/15, 4:25 AM</a><br><br>

Drone luring (with decoys and ruses) would probably be just as much fun as shooting them. You could probably do quite a bit with some cardboard, wire, cheap heat sources, and a couple of dogs for starters. And when the weather is on your terms a couple 5000$ anti materiel rifles with good optics, carefully timed fragmenting ammo, and well trained spotters with drone identification and ranging charts. <br>@Misti, JMG re infrastructure targets. I second that and would actually expand this to the whole West and most of the Asian manufacturing centers as well. Honestly, that is the bit of terrorism I am a somewhat afraid of - because I can imagine well that this could chase us away even further from an intelligently planned transition/collapse to sustainability. And yeah, it would take next to no budget and only a couple of weeks (perhaps up to a couple of months if you wanted to include food shortages) to burn us down a few decades on Hubbert's curve.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-economics-by-other-means.html#c5643914456440740217 title="comment permalink">12/3/15, 4:53 AM</a><br><br>

Their current make-up due to the pool of their recruits is focused on a quite limited set of targets. Generally attackers don't like to prey on victims they don't know or believe to understand - it messes up risk estimations. <br>The lack of a mental model for the system perhaps makes it uninteresting. <br>Come back from Paris and claim 130 dead (and to be fair this is an understatement because 7.62 mm AK gunshot wounds really suck), or say, knock over some power lines and put a few million people in the dark in winter. What will get more cheers from your peers and make you rise higher?<br>Afghans routinely picked up stray &amp; downed drones (1.6+ M$) and then drove a very hard bargain - before they would finally settle for like 100$ and return it. <br>I think this ignorance is a large part of the protection of civilizations against barbarians (perhaps already in Rome, e.g. Arminius). <br>The other big defense mechanism is contentment and perceived good intentions. If your enemy can't rely on his sleepers after 10 years, or has to assume 1/10 operatives is going to leak when the going gets a little rougher - you won't get far in many scenarios. <br>Now why that did not happen a whole lot (perhaps with false flags) in the cold war is an interesting question. It is documented on a small scale when the West messed in the GDR. But I guess the for the elites it is rarely a good idea to officially expand the conflict to the means of production. That is their stuff, and if you're on top you (ought to) become a little more risk averse. Wasn't that part for developing neutron bombs? Not break the stuff, and just resettle.<br>Of course there are state on state instances such as stuxnet, but I believe most are not so well documented.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-economics-by-other-means.html#c5545453806945560332 title="comment permalink">12/3/15, 5:50 AM</a><br><br>

Thanks for the great story, great blog, great books, and other great stories. I've been enjoying them and learning from them for years.<br><br>This series is great. I'm enjoying seeing your take on a government in the middle of collapse getting things right. I've been a little curious about geopolitics in this world, and about how the different countries interact and what they know of one another. I have to admit that the one thing I've been most surprised by is how little the protagonist knows about this country literally right next to his own, and that despite the fact that he's a central figure in his country's government. That required a little suspension of disbelief for me at first. Now I kind of trust that it could happen, but I'm still a little curious about it. Why is the Lakeland Republic inviting people to learn about it anyways? They've been showing other neighboring countries how they do things? I'm guessing this is for the purpose of stabilizing their neighbors to reduce the possibility of future war spilling into their area? I'm getting that the protagonist's country has stifled information about the Lakeland Republic, spun a lot of it to look bad, and has less information than we would have now. It's all interesting anyways.<br><br>I remember years ago we talked about Star's Reach being a setting for an RPG such as GURPS. There are some new games that do a really good job of giving players a lot of room for creativity and control of the narrative, and are quick and easy to play (both unlike GURPS). They also often do a really good job of helping their settings come alive. I'm a little tempted to try to come up with something in mid-collapse or post industrial America.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-economics-by-other-means.html#c6637397838051053159 title="comment permalink">12/3/15, 5:57 AM</a><br><br>

One theme I'm beginning to pick up on in this narrative is that many of the solutions that are proposed here: the tier system, the Swiss military model, the decentralized mix-crop agriculture, and the general approach to transportation, communication, etcetera between counties all have one big thing in common apart from the basic theme of grab-bagging from past solutions that have worked. They're all things that could be implemented admirably in a country the size of a small European Republic, but would be very difficult to manage in a country the size of the contemporary US. Aside from a few basic reforms (like the banking reforms Lakeland implemented, which some policy makers are alreadyconsidering reviving today), the policies Lakeland has implemented to save itself from collapse would not have been remotely possible without the dissolution of the United States as it currently exists. Am I picking up on an implication that it's the size, as well as the current geography of the United states that is driving it towards crisis? Would that mean that one of the "retro" aspects of retrotopia, that applies even outside of the borders of Lakeland could be a reversion of the geography of the US to something more closely resembling what it was prior to 1845 or so?<br><br><a href=retrotopia-economics-by-other-means.html#c5733886148009332007 title="comment permalink">12/3/15, 7:22 AM</a><br><br>

As I mentioned before, I am an American living in England for a few months during the recent rush to war following the Paris attacks. There are several ironies here - Jeremy Corbyn, who is not noted as a reasonable man in the UK, is the voice of reason pointing out that that using a million dollar smart bomb to take out a thousand dollar campsite of tents and Kalashnikov rifles is not the best possible use of funds, and Russian President Putin, who is probably as bad as his press, has pointed to oil revenues from "a supposed NATO Ally"; Turkey, as being a significant source of money for the terrorists.<br>Although destroying ISIL's funding sources is more effective than destroying ISIL’s military bases, these thoughts have not been welcome. There is no doubt that somewhere within ISIL there is a very closely calculated and very cynical cost benefit calculation of what it costs for propaganda, expense accounts, and equipment to recruit one suicide bomber versus what it costs an European nation to intercept on.<br>The shear quantity of propaganda on social media means that someone is being paid well to recruit young suicide bombers; the only honest journalism professor I ever had once pointed out "No one will pay you the big bucks just to report the truth." Ouch.<br>So your Lakeland's strategy of being cheap to defend and expensive to invade also works for organizations that want go on the offensive.

The Swiss are an obvious example of this. Many military theorists have called this type of strategy " 4th Generation War" though they don't embrace the low tech component. Despite the Swiss example, many think of the best example of 4th Generation Warfare as Hezbolah in Lebanon. My reading outside of U.S. media is that the Israeli's were handed a much greater defeat by Hezbolah during thier invasion of Lebanon in 2006 than is commonly let on. Hezbolah was dug in, with a decentralized command structure that was resistant to the airstrikes ment to nuetralize command and control. In addition is a technological choice that I would vote that the Lakeland republic make if they want to be truely successfull in repelling a high tech invadors. The Russian Anti-tank missles that Hezbolah had were key and fit in perfectly with the hide and pop-up strategy they employed against the Israelis. Though they have a decidedly high tech component ( high speed microprocessrs) , these could be smuggled in off the black market in large quantities as by common ones from their neighbors would be good enough for the task. A fairly simple man-carried missle that could be used against enemy tanks, trucks, helecopters etc. could be stashed easily and greatly increase the costs imposed on the invading force.<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-economics-by-other-means.html#c2008018800036023565 title="comment permalink">12/3/15, 9:02 AM</a><br><br>

I cannot tell what for sure.<br><br>From general principles, you can win many types of competitions if you are able to leverage your strenghts and exploit your opponent's weaknesses. You should try to mitigate your own weaknesses if you can - since you sould expect the opponent to try and exploit your own weaknesses - but you should not do so at the cost of giving up the offensive; there's no defense without attack. And definitively you should not let the opponent to exercise their own strengths unchallenged.<br><br>Your strategy - which I will not claim to be bad, since has the advantage of have been proven in real conflict many times in recorded history - feels like too self centered to me. You do things to leverage your strenghts (decentralize command, use guerilla warfare tactics, bring the conflict to the enemy's turf in the form of sabotage), patch up your weaknesses (arm and train the whole population, build infrastructure that will block rather than enhance the displacement of enemy's motorized units), and certainly avoid playing to the opponent strenghts (deny the enemy any big juicy strategic targets that their hi-tech forces can concentrate on). What I don't see is an attempt to actively exploit your opponent weaknesses.<br><br>To me, it feels like giving up the iniciative. And I share, like others before, the concern about a scorched earth attack. Let me try to put it in ecologic terms (to I am no expert). Imagine you have an ecosystem with porcupines and coyotes. The coyote species wants to make the porcupine species part of its diet, so the porcupine species adopt a "hold your grownd and make them bleed" defense. There will be individual coyotes eating individual porcupines from time to time, but those will learn that the damage they took is not worth to try again. So the defense will work.<br><br>Now, coyotes are smart of course, but imagine there were a coyote king that could coordinate all the attacks. Let's suppose after some experimenting he would figure out that the optimal strategy is to send 6 coyotes to harras a single porcupine for one hour. These teams of coyotes could theoretically take on one porcupine after another, and eat 2 porcupines per day each while sustaining minimal or mild damages in most cases. Now the defense has failed, since the porcupines are now clearly part of the coyote diet. What's missing is some central coordination between the porcupines to compel them to come help a neighboor in distress, or better yet, to launch preemptive strikes against coyote burrows to let them know that any offense will be retaliated in kind.<br><br>I see the part of the saboteaurs plays some of this role, but it feels a bit wrong. It does not feel like the kind of thing that would make a powerful enemy to back off, rather like the kind of thing that would compel them to escalate...<br><br>Dunno... just wanted to comment on it.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-economics-by-other-means.html#c1208557263088533209 title="comment permalink">12/3/15, 10:06 AM</a><br><br>

All of that has to create a positive cash flow, or you end up like the US in the Middle East spending trillions on a war that was supposed to pay for itself. What does Lakeland have in abundance? Good farmland, and not a whole lot else that you can easily cart off. It’s not likely the farmers will assist conquerors in creating abundant harvests for export. If it comes to a guerilla insurgency, any dispossessed farmer knows how to kill crops as well as grow them, using very low-tech and non-toxic methods. <br>As for the drone shoot, I don’t think the Lakelanders will need actual, expensive, functioning drones to get good practice. How does a drone behave? It moves in straight lines, hovers, swoops, and circles in the air. Birds behave like this (except for the hovering part). Sport hunters and those who do trap and skeet shooting intentionally develop the skills to shoot moving objects out of the sky, and this skill set can be used to shoot down low-flying mechanical objects, too. I have to assume, given the propensity for low-tech, that the weapon of choice would be the shotgun. Just about every farm household would have one. The organizers of the shoot could use flying clay targets, or even rig wire lines across the field of fire, and move the 'drone' targets along the wire to simulate good drone behavior.<br>As for trying to invade a territory that does not rely on electronics with devices and machines that rely on electronics, I think that a small rocket with a payload capable of generating a non-nuclear electromagnetic pulse would be sufficient to disable enough of the invader’s equipment, making rapid advance next to impossible. It should be easy to keep the effects local and targeted, with a bit of testing beforehand.<br>I’m looking forward to the next episode.<br>Stephen<br><br><a href=retrotopia-economics-by-other-means.html#c8612141120168533169 title="comment permalink">12/3/15, 11:01 AM</a><br><br>

I did get the sense that the Swiss had strength of character, resilience and independence of thought (though they could at times also seem repressive or just grumpy). It is a stark contrast to the kind of irrationality you often encounter around the topic of gun ownership in America. In places like Virgin, Utah where every household is required by law to have a gun (like in Switzerland) the lack of any similar requirement for discipline or training is concerning. I have an acquaintance who built a house in Virgin and to comply with the local law he cast an old pistol into his concrete floor by the front door so that no-one (including his young kids) could misuse it. In a time of crisis I'd much rather be around my Swiss friends grumpy Dad than one of the rabid gun rights advocates you encounter here in the west. <br><br>I can see that the irrationality surrounding the ownership and use of guns by Americans could change in a hurry with the type of crisis underpinning Retrotopia. I think that the response of the future inhabitants of Deseret would differ though. I'd guess they would rely on the mountainous terrain, brute force and obedience to the theocracy for defense and coherence rather than the disciplined but egalitarian, decentralized and independent approach of the LR. I suppose the geography of the Midwest necessitates/allows that approach to a certain degree.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-economics-by-other-means.html#c8595889568225458359 title="comment permalink">12/3/15, 11:16 AM</a><br><br>

Things are a bit in flux down here as the coldest winter in 26 years looks like it will be followed by one of the hottest summers in recorded history (certainly it looks like it is shaping up as a proper rip snorter and will be in the top 10 at the very least - the next 5 days are all over 30’C). Still, I may be wrong too and I'll let you know for sure in another 90 days...<br><br>I'm a bit slow on the uptake sometimes and the little light switched on today and the proverbial penny dropped - this was a doubly impressive achievement because I had not had my daily coffee yet (yes, I'm aware of your feelings for that beverage). Oh, as an interesting side note, I've actually planted yet another coffee shrub and off the back of the now successful tea camellia (outside, no less) experiment, I'm now already counting the potential coffee beans (maybe? Hehe!).<br><br>Oh, what I was writing about? Oh yeah, entropy. It is that simple really, because that is what we are facing - ignoring all of the human-centric details - and your posts and this story as well are all about a rear guard action to face entropy as a species and, well, mature into it. Certainly fighting it seems to be a losing battle. Maturing into it means accepting the cycles and will of nature, because we're actually part of it. Of course, I now realise that you understood this possibly as far back as the 1970’s and 1980’s as you have stayed remarkably on message for as long as I have been aware of your writings. Respect.<br><br>I guess our little and brief foray into fossil fuels has been a wild ride which is not yet over. Oh, I spotted an interesting point in an article by a botanist, although I'm pretty sure he missed the crucial point - or chose not to look too closely - but fungi showed up about 300 million years ago at the end of the Carboniferous period. Now remember that fungi - which is not a plant and is actually more closely related to humans than humans actually want to consider - consume cellulose (amongst other goodies) usually found in trees. The last coal was laid down at the end of the Carboniferous period and therefore a general conclusion can be made that coal really is irreplaceable - because even if forests and swamps were to take over the planet again the fungi will possibly convert all that mass into fungi poo (i.e. soil) well before it gets the chance using geological processes to turn into coal. Maybe in some seriously swampy areas it may be possible? Maybe?<br><br>I'm enjoying your story - as usual and the arrangement for people with disabilities is exactly how it works here (on the country trains) and there are steel ramps and the conductor usually assists people in wheelchairs with boarding. On the city trains usually the driver (as there is no conductor) will assist the boarding process. It is all quite civilised really. Trams are a little bit more difficult but they have recently been building higher platforms with ramps for people to step onto the trams.<br><br>Plus, I'm enjoying how you have subtly and not subtly introduced the memes into the story and use your protagonist as a working example of how poorly our stuff actually looks.<br><br>PS: So you've settled on an old school diplomat kind of a guy. Very wise, they would have been the smartest of the smart - when it wasn't an established post handed out as political favours - or repayments. That is a sure sign of a society in decay, if ever there was one.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br>PS: I've got a new blog post up: <a href=http://ferngladefarm.blogspot.com.au/ rel=nofollow>I like my new shed better than my old shed</a>. Yeah, I'm having to repurpose some of the infrastructure here that didn't work as planned. Nothing goes to waste though as it all ends up being used. Plus there are even more flowers (despite the heat) and I show some exotic fruit trees and how I have to manage for the contradictory risks of bush fires and evaporation in the orchard.

And as the fossil fuels that make globalization possible become increasingly scarce, the Americas are going to once again benefit from (or be cursed by, depending on the issue) our relative geographic isolation. So any would be refugees from more overcrowded parts of the world are going to find it much harder to get to the Americas than other parts of the Old World. While it is popular in the US to scapegoat our southern neighbors about illegal immigration, the truth is that none of Latin America is as overcrowded as parts of the Old World, and birthrates and population there are already leveling off and declining. So overpopulation is going to affect different parts of the world differently, and I don't think there's any reason to believe that the Americas will suffer the population strains the Old World is facing.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-economics-by-other-means.html#c352257378100063413 title="comment permalink">12/3/15, 3:28 PM</a><br><br>

The unwritten rule in US naval exercises is that the carrier group always wins, because that way the people who've built their careers around the current version of US naval technology don't have to worry about losing their place on the food chain. As for the economic disruption, yes, that's a very deliberate issue -- an attempt to remind the aggressor that the costs of war can linger on both sides of the border. <br><br>Maxime, that inevitable gap between military and civilian values is one of the reasons why the US never had a large peacetime army until 1940 -- back in the day, it was common knowledge that the only way to keep the military from becoming an independent political force was to keep it very small in peacetime, and have most of the muscle in time of war coming from part-time state militia units that were constantly training. The Swiss approach is frankly better, which is why I chose it for the LR. <br><br>Dagnarus, in a world in which resources are in short supply and a small peaceful state that exports lots of agricultural products is good to have on friendly terms, those nations that want to go the high-tech route might well choose instead to let the Lakeland model spread. As for the issue with terrorism, I'm sorry to say that the only way I could make my point would be to lay out exactly how such a thing could be done cheaply and easily, and that's not something I want to see in print. <br><br>Martin, thanks for the feedback from your own experience! <br><br>Tony, got it in one -- and of course after hubris comes nemesis...<br><br>Gregorach, fascinating. One of the reasons that canals are so resilient is precisely that you can build and maintain them with shovels and a few carpenter's tools powered by muscle, and the boats have the same power source. Did British canals use mule power, btw? That's the traditional American power source: "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxKy1_c6DeM" rel=nofollow>I've got a mule, her name is Sal</a>..."<br><br>Vilko, of course -- every small nation has to deal with the hard fact that a sufficiently large power willing to do whatever it takes can conquer it. The point of a successful military policy, on the part of a small nation, is to make the task look sufficiently costly and unprofitable that large powers will look for easy pickings elsewhere. <br><br>Donalfagan, I somehow missed that Tarzan flick -- pity, as it's a good line. <br><br>Barrymelius, true enough. <br><br>James, of course! <br><br>Latefall, drone luring sounds like a lot of fun, but the Lakeland Republic wouldn't do that publicly, to keep the other side from figuring out how to detect the lures. <br><br>James, he might well do so. I don't happen to know what was used to work out the orbits of the asteroids -- an important concern of astronomers for a century and a half after the discovery of Ceres in 1801, and one they accomplished quite handily with the available tools of the time. <br><br>Latefall, there's also the logic that keeps nations from using the systematic assassination of leaders as a major tactic in war -- if you start doing it, you know they're going to do it to you. <br><br>Patricia, exactly. All you have to do is put a sturdy metal ramp under the floor so it can be slid out, and make sure there isn't too drastic a gap between the floor and ground level. Yes, you'd need curb cuts, and there would have to be elevators in multistory buildings, but we already know the LR has those. Similar adaptations are easy enough once you ask the question, "What's the simplest effective way to make this easy to use for people with disabilities?"<br><br><a href=retrotopia-economics-by-other-means.html#c7324951491007118955 title="comment permalink">12/3/15, 4:03 PM</a><br><br>

One of the massive political facts of the present is the extent to which a huge number of Americans outside the wealthy and privileged enclaves on the coasts feel, with reason, that they've been thrown under the bus and kept there.

My impression of Amish pacifism is that it applies to "thou shalt not commit murder." A drone is not a human, shooting it down would not be murder, and might be easily justifiable if it posed a hazard to the family or community. Same for the coyote threatening your sheep. But individual groups are quite autonomous, and these things vary greatly from family to family.

It's simply that when a country's in a state of civil war, living there may not be a good idea -- and the likelihood that the US might go down that road rather sooner and more comprehensively than I'd thought earlier seems to be rising steeply. <br><br>Nick, I'd certainly expect reconnaissance drones of that kind, but attack drones firing missiles might also be popular as a way to get ordnance onto the battlefield without risking pilots and crew. Some drones would certainly fly at heights where you'd need a good rifle or even antiaircraft weapons to potshot them, others would go for the treetop approach. Thus your drone shoot training program has to cover quite a range of options, leading to different competitions. As for falconry...<br><br>Tom, I suppose. There are tastier ways to keep fed, especially if you're fighting on your own turf. <br><br>Betsy, I certainly don't want the eagle to risk getting hurt!

I assumed the Lakelanders meant drones something like the ones the U.S. military currently uses: fixed-wing, 50-foot wingspan, propeller powered by a 110 horsepower engine at 80 knots or so, or well over 100 knots if it's in a hurry, flying one to four miles up, weighing half a ton unloaded. Shooting one of those down with a shotgun or deer rifle would indeed be an impressive feat! (Hence, latefall's sensible idea of using specialized rifles firing fragmenting ammo, trained spotters, etc. preferably after luring the drone to a lower altitude.)<br><br>But discussion of drones hovering and being knocked down by birds makes it sound like we're talking instead about those tri-rotor or quad-rotor drones you can buy from catalogs and use to take aerial photos of your neighbors sunbathing. Those would indeed be vulnerable to shotguns, or a stick dropped by an eagle, or (I suppose) sparse nets of monofilament lofted by hydrogen-filled party balloons. To be fair, such copter drones could have some military uses (such as close-quarters reconnaissance down corridors and the like). But unless Lakeland is expecting an invasion of paparazzi, shooting at that kind of drone seems more like one of many situationally useful skills than a cornerstone of military strategy.<br><br>Combat drones flying (let alone hovering) in the open at altitudes within effective range of small arms fire from the ground would certainly be a juicy target for well-trained marksmen. But why would they be doing that? Perhaps if a military still had the technology for remotely piloting drone aircraft, but lacked high-magnification cameras or guided bombs to put on them, thus requiring low-altitude operation? Or does the Republic of Texas mount assault rifles on copter drones and try to use them as infantry?<br><br><a href=retrotopia-economics-by-other-means.html#c621930790788159243 title="comment permalink">12/3/15, 9:05 PM</a><br><br>

I had gotten my hopes up about how you would organise the LR armed forces, and I must say you've come up with a military quite to my taste. Funny thing is, I've realized, over here in my neck of the woods we actually have two seperate militaries. The first one is the standard self defeating deal that caters to supplying the empire with modest support in its adventures. It is extremely tech-minded, costly to the point of absurdity (the navy can't afford to operate most of its battle fregattes cause it bankrupted itself buying them, and it seems the air force will take that theme into the realms of parody with the F-35). It also seems to be constantly shrinking (i.e. becoming more "modern" and "efficient"). The second one is run by LR standards, and came into being in '46, determined to make use of some very hard learned lessons from the war years. It consists mainly of large light infantry units, every county having its own batallion with the companies divided up between the larger municipalities within that county.

Not incidentally, even though it dwarfes its conventional counterpart in terms of sheer size, it gets by on something like seven percent of the national defense budget.

Though such a plan of insurgency and decentralized countrol may work in the end it has one big disadvantage for those in power. If one country invades another with a spread out insurgent style defense force the obvious atractive soft targets are the seat of governement and the elites and their property. So if one day in the future the ascendent Islamic state with its new navy and airforce were to invade the U.S., which is now broke, and has adopted the Swiss model of defense they would certainly overrun D.C. , Wall Street, Greenwich Cn and the Hamptons and do some head chopping with those in power even though they might have trouble making any headway against the West Virginia Militia and eventualy leave and go home. Of course the elites don't like this scenario so they almost always choose the expensive expeditionary imperial style military machine even though it almost always leads said empire to the graveyard of history.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-economics-by-other-means.html#c7844502429561566539 title="comment permalink">12/4/15, 9:18 AM</a><br><br>

Now they cannot scale back that military presence without giving up control of resources, an inevitable outcome that political candidates do not want to talk about, so we spend inordinate sums of money (debt) to kick the can down the road.

As a civilian, you don't want to be around when an invading army comes through. Everyone would need to plan where they are going to go, possibly where they are going to hide until things settle down, how they are going to get news, what they can take with them. Knowing the local terrain would be vital to survival. Contemporary Americans are completely oblivious to their local landscapes, except for a few, including those of us who have an esoteric interest in really inaccessible campsites with water and foraging possibilities. As a civilian trying to disappear the densely wooded, rocky hills around me provide a lot of room to disappear. For people in other locales it would be something else, or maybe some places would be impractical to live in.

People are willing to inconvenience themselves to help their neighbour, and, likewise, their neighbours are willing to help them. Along the same lines, there's more adherence to traditions of manners &amp; hospitality. In the true, Burkean sense of the word, Canadians are conservative, and haven't lost as much of their social cohesion as the US. Where I'm from, people are baffled or downright suspicious if you offer to help them, they think you are expecting payment for services rendered. It really has people here flummoxed. Likewise, if you ask for or need help, expect others to disappear immediately--NO ONE will help you if you are in need, and they flee at the least indication you might in any way inconvenience them. People here are PETRIFIED others will take advantage of them. Keep in mind, I live in the South, which, traditionally always prided itself on its manners &amp; hospitality.<br>Another thing is that the "national mood", if you will, in Canada, is not nearly as toxic as the US. The biggest thing that bothers me about Canada is that Canadians, generally, absolutely WILL NOT contemplate the US failing, or what Canada would do in the event of a US collapse. You all seem committed to going off the cliff with us. It's very hard, if not impossible, to walk a Canadian through a US collapse scenario. I tried, once, to put the question of what Canada would do when the US collapsed. I asked, directly, if, since Canada has so many Chinese &amp; Indian immigrants, if they'd seek help from China or India in the event of a crisis /refugee crisis on the border. They were very uncomfortable with this line of reasoning. They kept going back to "either the US or Britain", even though Britain is less powerful than the US, now. Finally, with some ambivalence, they conceded that it MIGHT be possible for India to intervene since they were a part of the Commonwealth, but it was obviously an idea that made them uncomfortable. I kept thinking back to what JMG said, "you can't make someone understand something if their livelihood depends on them NOT understanding it."<br><br><a href=retrotopia-economics-by-other-means.html#c7662629656210177057 title="comment permalink">12/4/15, 1:58 PM</a><br><br>

Just last evening I wanted to add a little bit of music to my personal music collection (which isn't all that big to begin with). As we all know, music has largely gone digital and downloading .mp3s is pushed as a convenient way to buy it. Aside from the fact that digital music doesn't have as rich of a sound as yesterday's vinyl records, my experience with digital music files is that dealing with them can be a pain in the @ss. A smart phone seems to be the expected way to manage one's music anymore and your storage device is expected to be "the cloud". Well, I don't have a smart phone and don't want one (I have better things to spend my money on than a data plan), so I have to download the album and few additional tracks I purchased to my PC. <br><br>When I did this I discovered that the whole software platform and user interface used by the online store I purchased the music from had changed, forcing me to spend time figuring it all out--again just like I had to the last time I used it (which was about a year ago). I don't even want to get into the problems I have with the media player software on my PC. Suffice it to say, it has it's own set of annoyances. <br><br>The problem with software-driven technology is that the software and user interface is updated regularly changed under the guise of "improvement". It's neither an improvement or convenience when you have to re-learn them every so often. It's just an annoying waste of time. I spent less time 30-years ago making a mix tape out of vinyl records than I did yesterday downloading some music and making a 50-minute digital playlist. <br><br>The whole episode reminded my why I rarely purchase music anymore. There are no record stores within a reasonable distance of my house, and I'm not going to buy CDs from a big online store that mistreats the warehouse workers who would fill my order. It also reminded me of why I rely on the local college radio stations for my music listening fix (we are lucky to have 4 of them in my area). <br><br>I suspect that some will be tempted to tell me how I probably just don't know what I'm doing or that maybe I'm just an over-the-hill technophobe. To those I say save your breath (or keystrokes as it were). I'm not a techno idiot. Sometimes glitzy new technology is just a good example of diminishing returns.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-economics-by-other-means.html#c6015929928729076030 title="comment permalink">12/4/15, 3:37 PM</a><br><br>

I have no problem believing that's possible with 1950's tech; I still have the slide rule I used in college. Satellite tracking isn't really that hard. You can track the big pieces visually, and they might even use radar if they needed to badly enough. (The Brits had radar in WWII, and my dad ran a radar set in Japan during the Korean Conflict, tracking mostly seagulls and thunderstorms.) My question is, what's the point, other than as an academic exercise for physics students? Lakeland is not a space-faring country. Why would they care about satellite tracking?<br><br>Unless the drone-killing goes to higher altitudes if necessary. You can knock down a satellite with a sounding rocket, a bit of explosive, and a few hundred pounds of metal shrapnel if you know exactly when the satellite is going over. All you have to do is get some stuff in the way. It's like shooting a really big shotgun shell, and the satellite plows into the flak at 18,000 miles per hour. The Germans could have done it during WWII if there had been a reason. Does the LR have a couple of rockets hiding in silos somewhere to take out a satellite if necessary? Or is there a faction in the LR that would like to trigger the Kessler syndrome to take out some of the tech advantage the rest of the world has?<br><br>An excellent thought exercise.

And for all that, as someone who has lived in the lower Midwest all his life and knows the sorts of people who do support Trump, a huge part of me would be happy to vote in a fascist to spite the bipartisan neoliberal consensus.

The Lakeland military has appropriate antiaircraft weapons for the high-altitude drones as well, but those aren't the focus of the drone shoot -- it's the low-altitude drones that are on the menu every fall north of Hicksville. <br><br>S Wilson, I know.

"Newer" and "more complex" do not by definition mean "better" -- in point of fact, technology like everything else is subject to the law of diminishing returns, and increasing technological complexity -- as Joseph Tainter pointed out -- sooner or later goes into negative returns. <br><br>Raymond, nah, not foolish. One of the tricky things about a utopian narrative like this one is keeping in mind that the various people saying things to the narrator have their own agendas and biases. Ursula LeGuin is one of the few authors I know who really handled this well, in <i>The Dispossessed</i> -- even though that's more a wry commentary on utopias than a utopia, I've tried to borrow some elements of her technique here. <br><br>Dagnarus, yes, there was an embargo until three years before the story opens. As already mentioned, there was plenty of smuggling going on, much of it through Chicago, but there were also surpluses -- one way the LR dealt with that was putting a great deal of acreage into oil crops to provide diesel fuel, which can be stored, and was also in high demand for construction machinery during the rebuilding from the Second Civil War and the war of '49. As for imports, that's an interesting question, which will have to wait for an answer until I figure out more about the economies of the surrounding countries. <br><br>Jeff, there are at least three reasons for tracking satellite fragments. The first is that it makes a great teaching exercise for grad students. The second is that yes, there are potential military applications along the lines of those you've suggested -- a sounding rocket is well within the capacity of Lakeland technology. Third, the potential for a Kessler syndrome that would finish the process of making satellites uneconomic, and end the space age for several centuries or more, has massive implications in terms of the economic and military capacity of the countries surrounding the Lakeland Republic, most of which still rely on satellites to one extent or another. US military drones are controlled by satellite today -- what are the implications if satellites suddenly have an average lifespan measured in weeks before space debris takes them out? <br><br>Grebulocities, the only things Trump has going for him are that he's not part of the political establishment and he's willing to say things that nobody in the establishment would say. That may be enough to land him in the White House -- which is not exactly a prospect that I find cheering! If he does get taken out, either we get a bona fide fascist in the 2020 election or the country simply blows apart. The political class has lost its legitimacy in the eyes of the American people, and its blatant and single-minded pursuit of policies that benefit the privileged few and are driving the rest of the population into destitution and misery is becoming a catastrophic political liability that nobody in Washington DC seems capable of noticing. As Keith Brand used to say in the runup to the 2008 housing bubble, "Dear God, this is going to end so badly."<br><br><a href=retrotopia-economics-by-other-means.html#c6818731817089507947 title="comment permalink">12/5/15, 12:10 AM</a><br><br>

Incidentally, it completely makes the belief in progress and technology look like the laughing stock that they actually are because there is no winning against that universal reality.

I'd assume you have a couple of people who have to pick up equipment so it does not fall into enemy hands. This is probably going to be a major issue with hardware anywhere close to the front line. A simple mobility or mission kill on some expensive equipment quickly escalates to draw in more resources. Depending on their definition of violence, pacifists can still aim at tank tracks or down drones for example. Organic infantry level drones will be a rather important thing I believe - but it won't be a wonder weapon. There will be a lot of rock, paper, shotgun going on that will nullify much of their potential against a well prepared enemy. <br><br>@Dagnarus, JMG re import and surplus: Much agricultural surplus will likely go into strategic reserves (canned food, oils, alcohol). <br>In terms of imports my guess is a small selection of tools, (metalized) plastic foil (if there is not domestic producer), depending on how intellectual property is handled some pharmaceuticals, surely some alloying elements (tool steel), some ingredients for battery recycling, glass or ceramics, perhaps second hand solar modules, some relatively greenly produced LEDs (+ perhaps laser diodes), and components to stretch electronics lifetime, and lastly a handful of long lasting FPGAs (or directly some guided munitions from trusted sources, if either exists). It makes a lot of difference if the enemy has to assume there are a couple of highly mobile guided 155mm artillery shells (+optical designators) or anti-aircraft assets somewhere in the region. <br>The FPGAs could support (e.g. medical, biological) number crunching in times of peace, and be shoved into a reusable guidance kit (perhaps partially recovered via animal) mounted on large munitions or rockets.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-economics-by-other-means.html#c445256220859931932 title="comment permalink">12/5/15, 4:24 AM</a><br><br>

Revenge? Macho posturing? False flags operations? Nihilism? A little bit of all of the above? <br><br>It´s interesting to note that the Baader Meinhof Gang in West Germany apparently wanted the state to counter-attack in full force. It was part of their “strategy” to “expose the fascist character of the democratic state”, or what have you. A crazy, adventurist strategy, almost tailor made for somebody to take advantage of, sock puppet wise. Are some of the terror gangs in the Middle East playing with fire in the same way?<br><br>It´s also interesting to note that Daesh (“Islamic” State) doesn´t seem to have a real political program or social agenda, not even a Muslim fundamentalist social agenda (complete with soup kitchens for the needy poor and a populist theocracy). Daesh seems to be a criminal operation pure and simple. They are clearly guns for hire – witness how Assad could use them against the other rebel forces.

Al-Nusra, while nominally part of Al-Qaeda, doesn´t carry out terrorist acts on Western soil, concentrating on attacking Assad – this is logical, since the West (opponents of Assad) may otherwise attack them. In other words, they are taking advantage of the contradiction between their two enemies, the West and Assad. A classical strategy! The Taliban concentrate on attacking foreign troops and other adversaries in Afghanistan and Waziristan (where they are also hardest to track down). <br><br>Meanwhile, Daesh attacks both the West and Russia simultaneously, while also attacking other fundamentalists, such as Hamas, the Taliban, Al-Nusra…<br><br>Yes, something very “funny” is going on here.

It seems like an unusual assumption to make on their part given the long and protracted engagements that we seem to keep getting entangled in over the past 40 years. I dunno, except that I reckon that if engagements were set out to be won then different strategies would have been employed. For example in Afghanistan, I mentioned to you a long time ago that I would have broken the entire country up into manageable fiefdoms held by strong war lords bound by a simple and easy to understand basic set of rules. But maybe that is just my take on matters. Dunno.<br><br>Fortunately the marsupial bats have now arrived and are starting to eat some of the insects that are currently eating me.<br><br>As to the drones requiring high tech responses. I do hope that you introduce the shanghai? It still surprises me that few people seem to want to learn martial arts. I have to throw sticks at the magpies if they become a bit too cheeky and start aerial bombing my chickens when they are out in the orchard (which is most days). A shanghai would be a choice response to that, but then again I don't want to hurt the magpies, just give them a warning so the stick is a good response, but practice makes me a pretty shot. I doubt very much that drones in the future will look like the drones of today anyway.<br><br>Hi Chris Smith,<br><br>I doubt very much that deep cycle lead acid batteries require the rare Earth materials that you speak of. They're a very old technology and in fact the early ones used to be in the most beautiful glass jars where you could see all of the internal goings on. Nickel iron batteries are not that complex either.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=retrotopia-economics-by-other-means.html#c7406940054191802145 title="comment permalink">12/6/15, 1:50 AM</a><br><br>

Today has marked an unprecedented success for them on the first round of our Regional elections, and not so much of it is due to the recent terror attacks in Paris. People want change in the economy, and the common point between Donald Trump and the Front National is that they both claim to break from the neolibral consensus, by focusing on the national economy and on jobs.<br><br>But you can understand from the way he talks that Trump is your usual, unthinking business-obsessed American, a cliché of the self-made individualistic hero who is so good at being a business shark and at the same time conveniently happens to embody all virtues of love and altruism for election pictures.<br><br>The Le Pen gang have taken for their own use the anti-globalism rhetorics, but they never had a coherent believable vision of economic policies before, and their latest attempt at "de-diabolization" (a sucessful media strategy of pointing angrily at and severely sanctionning the most extremist nauseating parts of their own movement) is not very credible. Neither is their take on altermondialism as part of their mix with economic patriotism, for an economic program.<br><br>It is a common feature of populist regimes, to field extraordinary claims of rupture against the status quo.<br><br>@Tidlösa<br><br>Regarding the inconsistency of stances about climate change, Paris happens to be the host of this giant monster of a global climate conference, COP21. But the ecologists have never been weaker politically in France, and the current political blockbusters, the Front National, are promising a patriotic rupture from the status quo while still sticking the worn-out idea of economic growth.<br><br>I can tell by listening to the enlightened public radio that somehow journalistic perceptions are slowly, subtly shifting to the left, and starting to wonder about the whole idea of growth. But I cannot see that trend publicly articulate in public media discussions until quite a few more years, not speaking of actual lifestyle changes, so expect very little from the very country which hosts the conference.<br><br>One of the posters we can see in the subway stations of Paris is a poster issued by the WWF for the COP21, with a crowd marching among a city in rumble.

Couple this with an incentive to build all infrastructure with defense in mind, even a scorched earth policy would be difficult. If every house and barn was build with this kind of defense in mind, and underground root cellars doubling as tunnels as well as food storage would be a very hard to take target. When the first gulf war happened, there were no operative radars on the ground for long before a smart bomb would take them out. However if there were thousands of Ham radio operators, with low tech jamming and radar simulators out there, the number of expensive smart bombs becomes uneconomic, as well as interrupting any electronic communication and intelligence gathering.

An article called "How Hezbollah Defeated Israel PART 3: The political war" at http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/HJ14Ak01.html stated that the key was to ride out the waves of aerial attacks, hit their opponents key assets enough to draw in their land forces, and then use a well-trained force to maul the invaders. This seems to match your description of the Lakeland strategy in your narrative.<br> Without meaning offense, there may be a flaw in the idea of making an invading force reckon on the cost to a nation as being too prohibitive and it is this; It would only need to be profitable to a few key (defense) corporations to have a war launched anyway and they would not care about the effect on the economy of the rest of the country. Other corporations would be encouraged on the future profits to also go for an invasion. As an example, before the American invasion of Iraq a trade conference was held in which all the corporations got together to discuss how to cut up the Iraq pie and who would get what.<br> The reason that I remember this conference so well, as a side note, was that an executive from 7-Eleven boasted how a well-stocked 7-Eleven store would be able to successfully put out of business thirty Iraqi local business once set up and I remember thinking 'now where did you learn that particular lesson?'<br> A worse possible war for the Lakeland Republic would be like we see in Novorussia where the invading Kiev military was not particularly concerned with the population and would be quite happy to see the locals flee to Russia altogether. In this type of war, the invaders are only really after the land and its resources and the whole region is turned into a free-fire zone to get rid of the locals. The cleared areas would then be re-settled with their own people. It depends on how ruthless the 2065 Confederacy would be.<br> As for all this talk of drones, I am sorry to say that it is still early days on this particular form of warfare and may likely be just another weapon by 2065. We have not even had the phase of the development of hunter-killer drones that go after drones yet. I reckon that we are more advanced on how satellites can kill other satellites than how drones can kill other drones at the moment.<br> Please do not take this as criticism of the Lakeland Republic narrative, which I very much look forward to each week, but I do feel that some of these points should be brought up.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-economics-by-other-means.html#c6582269173519872608 title="comment permalink">12/6/15, 10:51 PM</a><br><br>

Nevertheless, I would respectfully suggest that they failed. <br><br>A contributing factor to the failure - albeit, surely, not a uniquely decisive factor - was the subversion of the Brothers' networks by the KGB or its predecessor agencies, possibly in part through the 1950s actions of the Cambridge Five or similar Soviet assets positioned in the UK. By 1958 or so, MI6 found that there was no point in maintaining radio contact with the Brothers, since the authenticity of their remaining proffered radio operator(s) was questionable. <br><br>I cannot speak at all for the government of the Republic. I would, however, submit as my own private view, writing as a private Estonian citizen, that Estonia's defence must incorporate in its foundations what one of the bloggers has helpfully noted at <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian-based_defense rel=nofollow>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian-based_defense</a>. One key in this is the use of embassies abroad, as indeed noted in the Reuters material referred to by Moshe Braner. <br><br>In the 1939-1991 resistance, our diplomatic institutions abroad were one of our few success stories. I will quote here, with a slight correction of fact, my own impressions both of the general diaspora and of the Legation in London, in my essay "Depression, the Body Politic, and Frankelian Freedom-to-Appraise" at www(dot)metascientia(dot)com: <br><br><i> The Estonian exile diaspora from the mid-1940s to the late 1980s provided a universal frame of reference, applicable wherever Estonian was read and spoken outside police control. All was homogeneous and predictable, whether the local Estonian House happened at that moment to be open for weekend lunch on the Sydney or on the Vancouver side of the Pacific, whether the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church happened at that moment to be worshipping in Toronto pews or in a Nova Scotia living room. I remember a courtesy visit to the decaying Legation at Queen's Gate in Kensington, London. Legation representative Mrs Taru and I took our simple cup of coffee amid opulent, disintegrating upholstery worthy of Miss Havisham in</i> Great Expectations<i>. Dear, kindly, dutiful old Mrs Taru! She had joined the Legation support staff in 1948 or so. She was at the time of our meeting, in the latter half of the 1980s, perhaps the one soul among the few with keys to that vast, deserted mansion who could claim some close personal link to the 1939 traditions of Estonia's Foreign Ministry. Someone at the United Kingdom Foreign and Commonwealth Office allegedly complained in the 1980s about the remarkable difficulty of dealing with a state that had ceased to exist half a century ago. And yet it was not difficult for us, its citizens: the eeriest part of my quiet chat with Mrs Taru was the realization that the objectively spooky milieu was to the two of us not spooky at all.</i> <br><br>A minor lead into the work of the Legation is <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Torma rel=nofollow>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Torma</a>. I have read the Estonian version of the Tiina Tamman's book <i>The Last Ambassador: August Torma, soldier, diplomat, spy</i> (an English version is cited at the end of this Wikipedia article), and can attest to Ms Tamman's thoroughness and sobriety. (The title is perhaps a little too lurid, though: it is evident from the body of the book that "spy" overstresses Ambassador Torma's modest known MI6 liaison.) <br><br><br>(line of reflection continued in next posting)<br><br><br>Toomas Karmo <br><br>(born in Nova Scotia in 1953)<br><br><a href=retrotopia-economics-by-other-means.html#c359233629100269432 title="comment permalink">12/7/15, 9:32 AM</a><br><br>

What is primary is the clash not of arms (so inefficient, so expensive, so - if I may be forgiven by some USA readers - Pentagonal). <br><br>This point has been well understood not only by our side in Tallinn but by our former source-of-misery in Berlin, and by the relevant elements all down the years in Moscow. <br><br>On the relevant period in the now-ended situation involving Berlin, I remark briefly:<br><br>* Dr Goebbels was said to have had on his desk a switch which made it possible for him instantly to speak to the entire Volk, by cutting into the normal operations of the Reich broadcasting network. <br><br>* The Leni Riefenstahl film "Triumph of the Will" has been available for inspection at Regg Hartt's private screening room here in the Toronto area. On seeing the film, I was horrified by its modernity - the classic techniques of mental manipulation as we know them from television, and yet deployed by Riefenstahl on the cinema screen, some years before even the invasion of Poland! (Ms Riefenstahl for instance shows the something-or-other Jugend camped out in conical tents, and then immediately switches her camera to the conical roofing on a cathedral. The subliminal message is that the something-or-other Jugend and the Catholic Church are in bed together. But her soundtrack does not at this point even say the word "church", so she cannot be hauled up for libel.) <br><br>Berlin would have got further, except that the guy ultimately in charge was not the brainy Dr Goebbels, but some chappie-wappie with a 'stache and a fondness for troops.<br><br>On Moscow, I remark that in the battle of ideas, not only 20th-century but also current operations are of interest. <br><br>* I was last week told that COP21 is being represented on Russian television as a climate conference convened in Paris <i>by an environmentally concerned Mr Putin</i>. (Perhaps some reader inside Russia can comment on this? I am working on my primitive Russian so slowly that I am not this year in any position to understand any television po-russkii- even though 50 or so Russian channels are readily available here in the Toronto area.) <br><br>* And I find a high-profile Russian-diaspora blogger, of a laudably environmentalist persuasion, recently commending Mr Putin for his concept of the "dicatorship of law", i.e., of the Magna Carta idea that law trumps kings. (This commendation is striking, since the acquittal rate in Russian courts is said by an informant of mine, and also in material I have found on the Internet, to be on the order of just 1 or 2 percent. Perhaps some Russian reader of this blog is able to comment further regarding the work of the current courts?) <br><br>The general pattern of 21st-century warfare is perhaps this, that the really smart money seeks above all to subvert institutions and sway opinion, in an inversion of Clausewitz, working on occasion through naive proxies such as the Islamic State: it is not now, as in Clausewitz's day, that war is politics by other means, but rather (for the smart money) that politics is war by other means. <br><br><br>Hastily, <br>feeling now a need to cheer up by thinking of Vera Lynn,<br><br><br>Tom <br><br><br>Toomas(dot)Karmo(at)gmail(dot)com <br><br>PS: OR by thinking of that Armstrong and Miller sketch on YouTube, <br>"from Season 3, Episode 5, describing the single most important piece <br>of intelligence from WW2" - but this I dare not refer to more closely<br>in a blog whose readership is the polite public, as opposed to the impolite <br>British barrack room.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-economics-by-other-means.html#c8036176255388375766 title="comment permalink">12/7/15, 10:09 AM</a><br><br>

Most utopias are filled with only perfect people, in which case, the system never gets truly untested.<br><br>Just a few thoughts on our perceptions of why wars develop. Most of the time, the aggressor is seen as trying to take control of it's neighbors for one of the following reasons:<br>1-control of the neighboring resources. Trying to control a route or valuable mineral etc.<br>2-as an outlet for their own social problems. Sending off criminals, soldiers, or excess upper class types so that they don't cause problems for the current upper class.<br>3-as a sort of preemptive defense. This can be from fear of the neighbor itself, or in desire of a buffer from enemies even further away.<br>4-because they're crazy and evil. I don't think this happens as often in reality, but it's certainly a portrayal I'm used to seeing in fiction.<br><br>One I rarely see is that the idea that the defending nation is just poorly run. As an analogy, let's think of two farms. One is well run and is large enough to keep Farmer McDonald quite busy, so you'd think he'd have no interest in his neighbor, Mr. Bones' farm. But Mr. Bones doesn't mend his fences and his cattle and sheep begin to make frequent trips to McDonald's pasture and feed bins. Now Farmer McDonald is going to spend quite a bit of effort in upkeep on the fences. Then Mr. Bones lets his field go wild with weeds which seed into all of his neighbors' fields. Finally, the Bones family leaves it's garbage out where McDonald's beloved dog can get into it; Bingo often gets gassy from this. Now McDonald is dealing with extra upkeep, lowered productivity, and a flatulent pet through no fault of his own. At this point, he will be very interested in getting control of the Bones farm. I haven't even mentioned why Mr. Bones farm is in such disarray, mostly because it does not matter to McDonald. Mr. Bones may be an absentee investor, perhaps he's incompetent farmer, or maybe he is getting to old or sickly to properly run his farm. He could be cruel and calculating or sweet and unmeaning, but the effects on his neighbors are the same. Admittedly, the take over of a neighboring farm rarely relies on bloodshed, but I am speaking to the motivation, not the means of war. Most media (fiction and otherwise) seems to be exclusively interested in the latter.<br><br>My point in all this is that warfare begins well before the first shot fired or ultimatum given. Though one side may be the first to send coordinated soldiers officially into the other's territory, the problems of one nation may have been invading the other's territory for quite some time unofficially. <br><br>*This whole post is not meant as a moral condemnation or justification for any particular invasion or war. I mean only to provoke some thoughts in a path I see rarely used.*<br><br><a href=retrotopia-economics-by-other-means.html#c2528433109172908665 title="comment permalink">12/7/15, 11:29 AM</a><br><br>

This weekend I drove my wife to the airport ,which was one of the first times I had been in a car in a long time. It was dark out and I noticed several large SUV's in the adjoining lanes with small flat screen televisions being watched by the passengers in the rear seats. At this blog both Automobiles and Television are rightly villified as technoligical choices with massive negative ramifications. So watching a TV in an oversized Automobile must be the ultimate poor technological choice. In fact an hour or so later I was thinking about it and realized that this is the perfect analogy to represent most the U.S. We are cruising down the road to the future in comfort while guzzling massive amounts of energy and wreaking the environment but we don't even see out the windows at what is going on because we are transfixed on watching mindless entertainment and subtle propaganda.

I couldn't help but think that in the world's current situation virtually no one is talking about the devastating multi-year drought which was a big(if not the biggest)contributor to the start of the Syrian civil war. Just one more example of how on the eve of war everyone seems to see all the reasons for the conflict EXCEPT the underlying economic reasons that are always there--only to be discussed much later by academic historians.<br>The farms analogy also made me think of all the agricultural products I have begun to notice of late that are products of the Ukraine and are filling the shelves of American grocery stores. No doubt Mr. Putin would like for Russia to again be the spigot through which that wealth makes its way out of Ukraine.<br>At the eve of the American Civil War the four states with the richest people were: South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, and Louisiana. In 2015 those same four states rank in the order listed: 39; 29; 50; and 42 among the 50 states. Of the fifty states, the national average falls just behind the top 20 states. The only state of the Old Confederacy that ranks above the national average is Virginia.(Source: Wikipedia) Can it be concluded from this example that there are economic consequences that are long term for starting a war that you lose? Mississippi now receives $2.02 cents back for every dollar that they send to Washington. As Lawrence Wilkerson observed, without that federal money coming back the heart of the Confederacy would resemble Bangladesh!<br>Such numbers, however, never tell the whole story. I am poor by any measure that this society would apply, but I have a roof over my head; I am better than well-fed; I have the lowest property taxes in the country--less than $250 a year for three properties that I and my family own. I am almost certain that none of the richest 20 states in America would compare on a percentage basis with homelessness in the South. But even here, as elsewhere in the country, there are too many usable structures for any American, or "illegal immigrant" for that matter, to be out in the cold!<br><br><a href=retrotopia-economics-by-other-means.html#c3536691287411562871 title="comment permalink">12/7/15, 5:58 PM</a><br><br>

The residents of New York City are allegedly famous for their sense of isolation, but one winter day when I was striding along a crowded sidewalk, the wind blew my hat off behind me. Before I could turn and catch it, it was caught and handed to me. I now believe that New Yorkers have a keen sense of "when the situation is contrived", and they just don't play along with the psychologists.<br> <br>I was also once stranded on the shoulder of a highway, and knew that the nearest service station was about two miles away. Not a bad walk, on a sunny afternoon, but I knew I'd be late at claiming my son from day care (and this, before the age of mobile phones). Before I'd walked 100 feet, a woman had offered me a ride, and would accept no compensation. <br> <br>When I saw a flat tire on a car parked by the guest of a neighbor in front of my home, I gently insisted on helping the young man (still recovering from Friday night's party) replace the wheel and tire. (The wheel needed to be replaced because he'd driven too far after the tire went flat. He had no spare tire, and no tools to remove the wheel.)<br><br>When my wife was diagnosed with cancer, one friend set up a "meal train" calendar so we wouldn't have to cook (or buy ready-made) meals on therapy days. 23 dinners, delivered in quantity for additional nights or lunch meals!<br><br>I think that one of the practical functions of a faith community is the "laundering" of charity. Direct charity can create uncomfortably ambiguous personal relationships of mutual obligation. ("Thanks, but what do you want from me? Just to recognize that you're so much richer than I am? Maybe I'd rather go hungry.") But when members "support the church", or "get help from the church", it loosens the connection, which makes us more likely to execute transactions which may, in the long run, turn out to be mutually beneficial. The intermediary pooling of resources allows the wealthy of one generation to assist the young of the next generation, who will never be able to repay the prior generation, but will assist the third generation. So the accounts do balance, indirectly, over time.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-economics-by-other-means.html#c3013830803273119551 title="comment permalink">12/7/15, 6:56 PM</a><br><br>

I think Mexico could be a significant regional power in the age of scarcity industrialism, and the whole of Latin America is a relative bright spot when it comes to trends on human rights, democracy, and equality. And, if it remains intact while the US implodes, there's no reason they couldn't take our name, as well, if there's no USA anymore, than certainly the Estados Unidos Mexicanos would be well within their rights to rename their country Estados Unidos Americanos (United States of America)<br>If at first you don't secede, try, try, again! LOL I was thinking about JMG contemplating leaving. I think I'd have to reiterate my comment on last post, if there was a viable, reasonable secession/rebellion that would not be worse than what it sought to replace, I'd be supportive. JMG seems to think that the Confederacy would be based on the original Confederate constitution, and, if so, then it would definitely be very Burkean in nature. The Confederate constitution was a virtual carbon copy of the US one, with some minor deviations regarding the rights of the states, which would be very small-c conservative/Burkean.

I saw a 3D printed dress last year; it might have been wearable at a fairly risque event, but was otherwise completely impractical. I seriously doubt you're going to see 3D printed clothing at a reasonable price point any time soon. Not that it can't be done, but the more capable 3D printers are neither cheap nor fast, and they also aren't the ones that you can find in hobbyist's hands.<br><br>What's more to the point is that there's an artificial spider silk jacket making the rounds in Japan right now; the vendors are saying they'll have artificial spider silk on the market next year. They're making it with sugar and e. coli bacteria that have been modified to produce spider silk proteins and then extruding it through artificial spinnerettes. As it turns out, there isn't one spider silk: every species produces a slightly different silk, sometimes more than one, and they have different properties.<br><br>Price not yet announced, but the Japanese are not known for announcing things they can't deliver. Here's a link to a story about it; it's not the one I originally saw, but it includes at least some of the details. http://news.discovery.com/tech/biotechnology/snuggle-up-in-this-synthetic-spider-silk-coat-151110.htm<br><br><a href=retrotopia-economics-by-other-means.html#c6625546392429159929 title="comment permalink">12/8/15, 9:11 PM</a><br><br>

I have a foot in both camps. But my gut says it is less likely here that I'll get the right person to scratch their head and do something than it is that someone reads it and re-posts parts somewhere in, say, northern Africa.<br>A couple more thoughts on more conventional military matters. I think Cherokee is right to expect use of shanghais (sling shots) in certain situations. I could imagine larger versions (or spear guns, atlatls) to launch larger loads as well. <br>The canals most definitely would make LR terrain significantly more defensible. Usually they'd be asymmetric, so the tanks can go in on one side, but not up on the other. The other thing that makes ecological as well as military sense is of course bocage. Basements and underground tunnels are another bit that makes a big difference (particularly for the more civil population) - so are they somehow incentivized?<br>Lastly, I wonder how the attitudes to chemical, biological, non-lethal, siege, or perfidious means may change. I am in no means sure about what will happen there, but here's a couple of considerations. Currently hope still makes people head for the city. Urbanization is still a trend even though cities eat people. Military industry sees urban terrain as likely future scenario. Generally urban terrain blunts the technological/training edge significantly. On the other hand history shows that cities are vulnerable to chemical or biological weapons. I think the temptation will be to big to refrain. But what would be the effects on morale? Would it be more like carpet bombing, or more like currency hyper-inflation? On the other hand, if the population hides in the bush (and the very young and old generally die there, see various African conflicts) this favors scare tactics that win the war not by actual battle but more by obvious disruption of society. I guess in certain climates/seasons/wealth strata there is going to be a strong push to sit it out come what may. Perhaps a wedge could be driven into rich/poor or urban/rural populations that way. I wonder if B&amp;C weapons on squad level would make much sense, but I think in principle they could. If you make someone (appear) real sick then either their buddies have to kill him/her or you tie down more resources. From today's perspective this would be pretty problematic, especially from a legal point of view. But how many people still care after they've been plutted a couple of times?<br>I wonder if the LR has a centrally (democratically?) defined defensive plan. Because in most (defensive) cases that would mean that the burden is potentially very unevenly distributed. I wonder how that what-if gets factored into daily politics.<br>Lastly, nowadays it does not seem to be particularly popular to go out of your way to take prisoners (perhaps also a question of the determination of combatants in currently reported conflicts). Even though we'll probably be sitting on a surplus of humans for some time (unless nuclear or biological get real big) I wonder if there'd be a couple of gangs of Confederates or Brazilians tending to the canals in the LR? This makes me wonder if there's been any advances in "prisoner taking tech". This is a particularly good option if you are defending of course, and I can think of a couple of ways this could also be organizationally included.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-economics-by-other-means.html#c7163753201984630965 title="comment permalink">12/9/15, 4:23 AM</a><br><br>
