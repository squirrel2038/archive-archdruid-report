This is the twelfth installment of an exploration of some of the possible futures discussed on this blog, using the toolkit of narrative fiction. Our narrator attends the Lakeland Republic's annual drone shoot, and finds out that not all technological innovations start out from the current state of the art...<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><br>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
***********</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A rooster yelling at the top of its lungs woke me before dawn the next morning. It didn’t seem likely to shut up any time soon, and I doubted the New Shakers would be happy if I threw things at their livestock, so I got up instead. I rang the bell as I’d been told, and a couple of minutes later, a quiet knock on the door announced the arrival of a middle-aged woman with two pitchers and a bowl. I took them and thanked her; she smiled and curtseyed, and headed off to somewhere else. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I started washing up, and only then realized two things. The first was that there weren’t any outlets for electricity in the room; the second was that the only thing I had to shave with was an electric shaver. I finished washing and got dressed, hoping a day’s growth of beard wouldn’t be a faux pas by Lakeland standards. Maybe half an hour later, I was sitting behind Colonel Pappas in the jeep as it rattled over a dirt road on its way to the Lakeland Republic’s annual drone shoot. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“How much do you know about modern drones?” Pappas had asked me the night before; when I admitted my ignorance, he laughed. “Fair enough. You start talking about drones, a lot of people think of the old first and second generation machines, the ones that used to launch rockets from a mile or so in the air. Those haven’t been in frontline service since the ‘thirties—ever hear of the battle of Mosul?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I tried to remember. “That was in the second Kurdistan war, wasn’t it?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Bingo. Both sides had drones, but the Kurds figured out that you can target them with old-fashioned antiaircraft guns, got a bunch of those in place without anybody being the wiser, and took out most of the Turkish drone force in an afternoon. After that, you had militaries all over the place figuring out ways to target drones, and that’s when the sort of drones you see these days started popping up on the drawing boards—observation drones way up where artillery can’t hit them, and attack drones flying at treetop level where they can hide from radar. Of course then they’ve got other vulnerabilities.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Can’t they simply reprogram their attack drones to fly high if they’re going to attack you?” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Sure.” He grinned. “We’ve got plenty of old-fashioned antiaircraft guns, too.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So there I was, jolting along a rough road with brown fields of stubble to the left and a line of trees to the right, and a moving dot up above the trees caught my eye. I turned to look; Pappas saw me move, turned in his seat, and handed me a pair of binoculars. Despite the joggling of the jeep, I managed to get the thing in focus: a lean angular shape with broad straight wings, flying low and fast. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As I watched, shards suddenly flew up from the middle of one wing. A moment later the outer half of the wing tumbled one way and the rest of the drone tumbled the other. I managed to follow it most of the way to the trees, then handed the binoculars back to Pappas. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Wing hit?” he asked, pitching his voice to be heard above the jeep’s engine. I nodded. “That’s the easy one,” he went on. “Good shots aim for the engine or the fuel tank.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A quarter mile or so on, as another drone came into sight, the road veered suddenly to the right, ducked through the trees, and stopped in an impromptu parking lot where jeeps were more or less lined up. Just past the parking lots was a cluster of olive-drab tents, and past those a fair-sized crowd. Off to the left, though, a bunch of horses were munching grass in a fenced-off field, and as I watched, a dozen or so people in Lakeland Army uniforms rode up on horses, dismounted, and led the animals into the field. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The jeep rolled to a halt. “What’s with that?” I asked Pappas. “Cavalry in this day and age?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Nah, dragoons.” He figured out from my face that I didn’t know the word, and went on: “Mounted infantry—they ride to the battlefield and then dismount to fight. Most countries had ‘em until the end of the nineteenth century, and we tried ‘em out in the war of ‘49 with good results. Transport’s a lot less difficult on the logistical end of things if the only fuel you need is hay.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I got out of the jeep. Pappas hauled himself into his wheelchair, then handed me a pair of earplugs. “You’ll need these,” he said. “Drone rifles use .50 caliber ammo, and that isn’t easy on the ears.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We wove our way through the tents, through the crowd, and out to the places where the guns were firing. There were maybe two dozen of them in a big arc, each with twenty or so stations for shooters, though things were just getting under way and most of the stations didn’t have anyone at them yet. “Those are first timers doing their qualifying rounds,” Pappas said, pointing to one set of stations filling up quicker than the others; the earplugs muffled his voice but I could still hear him. “Over here, the expert marksmen—you’ll see some of the best shots in the Republic here today. Check this one out.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“This one” was a short middle-aged woman in jeans and a buffalo plaid wool shirt, cradling a rifle that must have been as long as she was tall. Past her, I could see a dot against the morning sky. She lined up the shot with practiced ease. Even through the earplugs, the crack of the rifle was loud enough to sting. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A moment later, off in the distance, the dot vanished in a little red-orange flash.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Sweet,” Pappas said. “Right in the fuel tank. That’s Maude Duesenberg—I honestly don’t remember how many drone shoot trophies she’s got on her mantle, but it’s got to be getting crowded.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Where do you get all the drones?” I asked him. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Oh, most of ‘em we make ourselves. Expert class and proof-of-concept shooters get real drones—we buy them through traders in Chicago. You probably don’t want to know how many officers in how many countries sell us a drone or two every year, list ‘em as crashed, and pocket the proceeds.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I knew enough about the military back home to guess that the Atlantic Republic was on that list. Still, something else had sparked my curiosity. “What’s proof of concept shooting?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“New or revived technologies. They’re over on this side—let’s check ‘em out.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Instead of the shooter’s stations elsewhere on the arc, the place for proof-of-concept shooters was an open patch of mostly flattened grass with a long straight view ahead of it. There wasn’t much of a crowd there, just a couple of officers in the ubiquitous Lakeland trench coats, and several dozen kids watching with hopeful looks on their faces. Out on the grass were maybe twenty soldiers who looked even scruffier than I felt, manhandling what looked like a cannon on an oddly shaped mount. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Oh my God,” Pappas said. “I know these guys—the 34th Infantry from Covington. I wonder what they’re up to; that can’t be an ordinary howitzer.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I gave him a startled look. One of the officers standing there laughed, and said, “Good morning, sir. Yeah, Carlos and I have been wondering about that since they started setting the thing up.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Introductions followed; Michael Berconi and Carlos Lopez Ruiz were captains in the Lakeland Army, down from Toledo to watch the proof-of-concept tests. “You probably don’t know about the 34th,” Lopez said to me. “They’re a bunch of maniacs. Every year they come up with some new stunt.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That’s for sure,” said Berconi. “You should have been here last year. We were standing here, and all of a sudden a bright red triplane—you know, like the Red Baron’s plane—comes over the trees there and starts jumping drones from above. I heard later they spent two years building the damn thing.”
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’m surprised the drones didn’t dodge it,” I said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“They couldn’t see it,” Pappas told me. “Military frequency radar won’t see wood and fabric, and military drones only have video looking forward and down—though I understand that’s being changed. You’re not the only visitor from outside at these events.” He grinned, though there was an edge to it. “Though most of the others don’t announce themselves.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The soldiers out on the open grass had finished setting up their cannon, and one of them spread his arms in what was pretty obviously a signal. “Here goes,” Pappas said. “You may want to put your hands over your ears; a 75-mm howitzer makes more noise than your earplugs’ll handle.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I covered my ears. Off in the distance, a dot rose up into the air and came toward us in a zigzag pattern. About the time it got close enough that I could see more of it than a dot, the cannon went off, and Pappas wasn’t kidding; even with my hands over my ears, it packed a wallop. Something blurred the air downrange from where we stood; an instant passed, and then the drone shattered as though it had slammed into an unseen wall. The watching kids whooped; so did the soldiers, and then reloaded. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“What the ringtailed rambling—” Pappas began to say, then covered his ears; he’d spotted the next drone a moment after I had. The same process repeated, except that the second drone only lost half of one wing; that was enough to send it tumbling down onto the range, but the chief of the gun crew regaled the others with a string of profanity that would have gotten a standing ovation from Marines. Then it was hands-over-ears time; they let the final drone get good and close before firing, and so I got a fine view as something slammed into it and sent the fragments<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>tumbling down to the grass below. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Before the soldiers had finished whooping Pappas wheeled out toward them, shouting, “What the <i>hell</i> are you maniacs putting in that thing?” He was apparently no stranger to the 34th Infantry; they greeted him with sloppy salutes and big grins, and the crew chief and one of the others stood talking with him while the others started breaking the cannon down for transport.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A woman’s voice sounded behind me:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Excuse me, is this the place for proof-of-concept tests?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I turned around. She was a twenty-something blonde in a big brown barn coat. “Yes,” I said. “They’re just packing up from the last test.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Oh, good.” She turned and waved, and someone hauling a cart with two bicycle wheels came out of the crowd. He turned out to be a young man of about the same age, in a fedora and trench coat that had seen quite a bit of hard wear; one of his shoulders was noticeably higher than the other. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Are you with the soldiers?” she asked me. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“No, just visiting. I’m Peter Carr.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’m Emily Franken, and this is my husband Jim.” Hands got shaken all around. The cart was full of what looked like antique radio gear—a couple of big metal boxes with dials, switches, and gauges all over the front, and something that I swear looked like a death-ray gun from some old skiffy vid. The kids craned their necks to look at it all, but had the common sense not to touch anything.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Should I ask about that?” I motioned to the contents of the cart.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Sure,” she replied. “It’s a maser—a microwave laser. It’s old tech—they made them in the 1950s, but nobody could figure out how to get real power out of them.” In response to my look of surprise:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“There’s a lot of things like that—interesting bits of technology nobody followed up on.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“What Emily’s not saying,” Jim interjected, “is that she spent two years studying quantum mechanics to find something that would mase steadily at room temperature, and published a couple of papers that are<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>going to turn three or four branches of physics on their heads.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Oh, stop it,” she said, blushing. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Not a chance. When we were in engineering school, Mr. Carr, Emily was the only person in class who came up with anything really interesting for me to build.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“And Jim was the only one in the class who could build the things I needed for my projects—so of course we got married right after graduation.” Laughing: “When he proposed, he said I had to marry him so I’d almost have the right last name to be a mad scientist, and a hunchbacked lab assistant too.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He grinned, pushed his raised shoulder up further, and gave me a bug-eyed look. I laughed. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Out on the grass, the soldiers had the cannon and mount set up for transport, and hauled it back toward the parking lot and the jeeps. I wished the Frankens good luck, and they hauled the cart of electronic gear out onto the field. They passed Pappas as he came wheeling back, shaking his head. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Even for the 34th, that’s pretty good,” he said when he reached me and the two captains. “You know what they were shooting?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Canister shot.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Lopez and I looked blank, but Berconi let out a startled laugh. “Seriously?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“God’s honest truth.” To the rest of us:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“It’s something artillery used to use back in the Civil War and before—basically, the world’s biggest shotgun shell, with pellets half an inch across.” With a motion of his head in the direction of the Frankens, who were busy setting up their gear: “What’s that all about?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Some kind of twentieth century microwave laser,” I said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Pappas gave me a startled look, then turned to Berconi. “What’s on their schedule?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Standard three trials—well, but they’ve requested one with live ordnance.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Pappas let out a long whistle. “This could get colorful.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Out on the grass, the two had finished setting up their gear: a row of batteries, the two boxes, the death-ray-thing on a tripod, and cables connecting them. Emily Franken signaled that they were ready, and then got behind the ray-thing and aimed it downrange while her husband hunched over the two boxes and fiddled with the dials. The first drone appeared in the distance. I’m not sure what I was expecting—flashes and bangs, a beam of light, or what have you—but all that happened was that the drone suddenly dropped out of the air as though the Frankens had flipped the off switch at a distance. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A second drone met the same fate a few minutes later. “The third—” Pappas said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That’ll be the one with heat on board,” Berconi told him. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By the time the third drone went up people were beginning to drift over to the proof-of-concept range, wondering what was going on. As it came close enough to be more than a distant dot, I could see two missiles under each wing. Emily Franken crouched behind the device she was aiming, Jim twisted dials and fiddled with switches, and all of a sudden the drone vanished in a flash and a bubble of red fire. The sharp crack of the explosion, muffled by the earplugs I was wearing, arrived an instant later. The watching kids whooped in delight. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Berconi and Lopez hurried across the grass to the Frankens the moment the flaming wreckage of the drone was on the ground. “What do you think?” Pappas asked me. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I have no idea,” I admitted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“What did they do, microwave the inside of the drones?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Good question. If I had to guess—well, you know how a radio antenna works? Radio waves hit a piece of metal the right length and set up a current in it? I wonder if they’ve tuned the thing so that it sets up electrical surges in the onboard computer chips and the fuses for the missiles.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I gave him a horrified look. “You could fry anything electronic with that.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Not our gear. All our electronics use vacuum tubes—you hit those with a surge, they just shrug—but outside electronics? Pretty much, yeah.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I considered him for a long moment, and then wondered whether this whole business had been staged for my benefit. “You get a lot of mad scientists here in the Lakeland Republic?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“You’d be surprised,” he said with a grin. “Lots of technologies that got invented in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries were just plain abandoned even though they worked fine—there wasn’t a market yet, or something else got there first, or somebody bribed the right officials so government policy favored some other technology instead. A lot of engineers here spend their time going through old technical journals and what have you, looking for things that the Republic can use.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Like canister shot,” I said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Bingo. Or masers, or dragoons—or for that matter canals and canal boats.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
The Frankens had their maser broken down and loaded on the cart, and they were hauling it away, still deep in conversation with Berconi. Lopez headed back our way, while a bunch of soldiers hauled something that looked like a hand-cranked Gatling gun out onto the grass. “Come on,” Pappas said then. “Unless you want to see more here, of course. The expert competition ought to start pretty soon.”</div>

I have to admit though, my hopes were raised ever so slightly when you said Jim Franken had "one of his shoulders was noticeably higher than the other." I immediately thought of longbow archers/warbow re-enactors, and thought that they would be shooting down drones with longbow arrows! One can dream, right!?

I remember learning about the maser years ago and how when the laser was developed, the maser was dropped. It seems reasonable to me that the maser could have been developed into some sweet applications if it received anything close to the attention lasers got. I suppose the thing to do now is to preserve the old journals, so that the dropped leads could be picked up when the time is right for them. Do you think that the folks in LR read paper versions or microfilmed ones? I doubt the versions saved on the Internet will be accessible, but at least as recently as the early 1980s when I was in grad school, all the journals I read were on paper or on microfilm. Microfilm readers should be well within the ability of the LR to support. That would be a lot of old technology to choose from.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-neglected-technologies.html#c870555914985033075 title="comment permalink">12/30/15, 4:22 PM</a><br><br>

In January, I was hearing from several sources -- renegade economists, professional news watchers, and so on -- that 2015, either spring or autumn, would be a year of devastation for the stock market in particular if not financial infrastructure at large. So, I posted such a warning in the comments, and I divested from what investments I had. Since it's now December 31 in my time zone, it's become apparent that this prognostication was simply another case of what JMG detailed in his 2011 book "Apocalypse Not."<br><br>2015 was an insane year where the official indicators of economic progress diverged from the actual life stories of millions around the world in new, unexpected, and surprisingly revolting ways. If in 2014 you had put money on the GOP having an internal revolt against the entire system of American politics, you'd be rich now, but if you had money to spare on betting on a sudden and devastating financial collapse, you would have lost it on my advice, so my apologies. I hope no one took the advice of my blog comments.<br><br>Rather than divesting, I will try my best to look to 2016 with a positive attitude of investing in our future. Maybe there are some neglected technologies that conceal hidden gold -- in the spiritual, not the economic sense -- to be discovered by future generations.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-neglected-technologies.html#c8790229850082608128 title="comment permalink">12/30/15, 4:35 PM</a><br><br>

Turns out that quite a few guys who have started channels in the last few years exploring technologies that can be put together on a shoe string budget with common materials and gear a normal person can get at the hardware store. Trying to figure out just what they are saying has motivated me to brush up on my basic understanding of electricity, chemistry, and physics. Just got back from getting some stuff for electro plating. I adore the mad scientist type, and sharing videos is really speeding along their progress, bouncing ideas and all that. Of course I am concerned that YouTube could go off in, well, at anytime really. So each video I watch, especially chemistry, I try to note down the process, record it on paper in case use for such a process comes up.<br><br>Some fellows I follow are close to the free energy circles, often harvesting energy differences in the microAmps. Very interesting effects they are measuring, but this civilization don't run on microamps!

(It sounds like something the 34th Infantry would try.) <br><br>SLClaire, I'm quite sure the Lakeland standard is printed paper -- I suspect a lot of copies were made from microfilm and other higher-tech sources in the early years of the Republic, and reprinting bound volumes of old journals for sale to the mad scientist community probably keeps a number of niche-market publishers in business. <br><br>Avery, thank you! Yes, I heard the same claims; for that matter, I overestimated the speed with which the current economic crisis is unfolding -- I'll be talking about that in my New Year's post next week. I appreciate that you're willing to 'fess up to the mistake -- that's not something many people do on the internet. <br><br>Jean-Vivien, don't hold your breath -- you'll turn blue and pass out.

As for drones in general, the only reason they've gotten so much attention is that none of their targets have either adequate SIGINT or adequate firepower; the much-ballyhooed Predator drone would quickly become prey in the face of what used to be ordinary antiaircraft fire -- and we don't even have to talk about what would happen if some bright soul in Russia, China, or what have you has thought of a missile that pops up above the drone's operating altitude and then homes in on the signal that connects the drone to the satellite...<br><br>Ray, I'm a great fan of mad scientists. The switch from basement workshops to sprawling corporate research centers hasn't been good for the sciences, or for that matter for technology -- groupthink has had its usual effect, and there's also the awkward fact that the only technologies that get developed these days are those that promise a hefty return to some Fortune 500 corporation. In the days when the Wright brothers' bicycle shop was the model for technological innovation, that was much less true. Thus my advice to you and all aspiring mad scientists is to put on that lab coat and throw open the switches to the sonic oscillator!<br><br><a href=retrotopia-neglected-technologies.html#c5849787239957882689 title="comment permalink">12/30/15, 6:06 PM</a><br><br>

Usually the engineer's duties consisted of signing the log on the hour (and half?), checking the box for normal operation. One of the rectifier tubes burned out. These were mercury-vapor tubes that gave off a blue glow from a glass box in the main room of the little shack. There were six of them, for a full-wave rectifier on a three-phase supply. Some flashes and sparks and it went out. The engineer went to a control panel and dialed the transmitter back to 83% of full power (not to stress the remaining five), and noted that in the log. When he shut down at midnight, he waited for the rectifier to cool off and replaced the tube. Then powered back up for a few minutes' test pattern to verify normal operation. Probably no one watching TV noticed. <br><br>This transmitter was old-fashioned, even for the '70s. They were still using vacuum tubes for the big power supply and final stage. The final was an interesting affair that looked like a high-tech wood stove. Instead of a chimney it had a copper coax about 6" in diameter that carried the VHF signal up to the tower. Not flexible, it was more of a pipe (with a smaller pipe inside it). The 'stove' part had windows, and you could see inside by the light of the filaments of the air-cooled, glass-envelope triodes. <br><br>The engineer told me of a time when he was watching the final while lightning struck the tower. He said there were visible sparks and little fireballs bouncing around inside the final tubes. They were off the air for about one second, and nothing needed to be replaced. <br><br>By the way, when you go down the line reading those old analog meters, you tap them a couple times with your forefinger before taking the reading. That's because the needle sticks sometimes if it just sits on the '100%' mark for days on end. I later had a short career doing what my friend did, but did not have the patience for it in the long run...<br><br><a href=retrotopia-neglected-technologies.html#c4831136862128064956 title="comment permalink">12/30/15, 6:12 PM</a><br><br>

The normal targets of longbow arrows, such as deer and French knights, can be incapacitated by pain and blood loss if you hit them anywhere more or less central, but an arrow through the wing isn't necessarily going to cripple a drone -- unlike a .50 cal. bullet, which packs enough kinetic energy to shatter the wing structure and tear off a good bit of the upper surface on the way out. Again, I'd be delighted if a longbow shaft could do an Agincourt on drones, but I'd want to see the thing tested.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-neglected-technologies.html#c7956234773476725571 title="comment permalink">12/30/15, 6:30 PM</a><br><br>

But yes, they are resilient. <br><br>The tower was shared by another VHF station, which was entirely remotely operated from the downtown studio. There was no engineer on duty, it was all automated. Its final was large transistors, in metal cans. Our old tube-transmitter was just the one system, but the newfangled transmitter had a whole redundant second transmitter. If lightning hit it, the system would simply swap in a warmed-up redundant final, and await repairs. I have no idea how that worked out for them, but I think it is generally how things are done now. Most people don't even rely on over-air broadcast any more. <br><br>As for the drones, I have heard that some schools are working on a countermeasure that consists of three or four hummingbird-size craft that fly in formation, carrying a lightweight net. They fly up over the drone they are targeting, and drop it into the blades. Of course, all the current generation of drones are entierely dependent on current generation miniature solid state electronics, including gyroscopes and accelerometers as well as microprocessors. <br><br>I am not sure how vacuum tubes will support a sufficient level of complexity.

Is there shortly going to be another blog, Theotherarchdruidreport.blogspot.com ? It would be interesting to have another Archdruid reporting a druid's eye view of the world. <br><br>One of the other things to recall about drones, too, is that they're relatively cheap. They're currently made out of cheap plastic, but my school owns a hobbyist one that I've had the chance to fly, and there's not much to it that couldn't be done to create flight surfaces of balsa wood or similar. Recon drones for civilian or hobby use can be had for under $100 these days. I'm not a competent flyer of them, but a number of my students have taken this quadcopter out for a spin. We've kept it in the air for 15-20 minutes over open ground; seven minutes or so over trees, and nearly lost it a couple of times. But the one we have is not suited for much in the way of challenging weather conditions. Cold air, wet air, damp air, gusty breezes, rain, all of these interfere with operations. You can pack more sensors into a drone, to give the pilots more feedback on flight operations, of course... But those take time, weight, and space in the drone — making it a bigger target. And, again, they're cheap enough for now at least, that the lakelanders could deploy drones agains their drone invaders, too. This is very much a two-way air battle in which it would be easy for the two sides to field forces in rough parity. <br><br>On the defensive side... Netting, tree-mounted mesh networks of radio jammers (not the Lakelanders' style, but maybe the Brazilians? the opposite of the networks arranged for the use of the One Laptop Per Child initiative), trained falcons (and falconers — jobs for lakelanders!), chain-shot in addition to canisters, could all do a number on invasive drones. You could also build those platforms such as Tolkien described in Lothlorien, what were they? Flets? Enough places to hide markswomen, launch facilities, falcons/falconers... Every wooded region along a border provides defense in depth. Oh... the use of flare guns to fire bright lights HIGHER than the drone's operating flight, to backlight them and make them a more obvious target for a long-barreled rifle.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-neglected-technologies.html#c5175561797135374110 title="comment permalink">12/30/15, 7:48 PM</a><br><br>

That's certainly the plan. <br><br>William, I see you weren't paying attention. Pappas noted in the narrative that the kind of drones we have now became obsolete once militaries around the world started coming up with ways to target them -- a drone at 20,000 feet is easy meat for a range of technologies. The German 88mm antiaircraft cannon, for example,, could hit aircraft at 25,000 feet. The US top of the line AA gun during the same war, the M1, had an effective vertical range of 60,000 feet. (And of course modern militaries in 2065 presumably have antidrone missiles and antidrone drones as well.) The only reason US drones aren't being blown out of the sky in the Middle East is that they're being used to target people who don't have anything more powerful than machine guns; against an opponent with any kind of antiaircraft capacity, they'd be toast in short order.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-neglected-technologies.html#c1257448053487300813 title="comment permalink">12/30/15, 10:39 PM</a><br><br>

So it was electricity after all. Well, we'll get by without that. Which makes me think about the future of hand pumps - I'll have to look into that and start constructing one sooner or later. So many projects, so little time. I’ve been giving deep thought to your recent Galabes essay too.<br><br>Nice to see that we finally made the drone shoot! Excellent! I assume that the Lakeland Republic has an overriding strategy of showing a diplomat from the neighbouring country the potential responses to that countries technology? Dunno, that one is a bit lost on me because I would have thought that the Atlantic Republic would already be well aware that their drones were next to useless. But then drones may have a constituency like aircraft carriers do now? Maybe that is what was meant by the “drone economy” which I read about recently? It was interesting to read about corruption with the sale of the drones. An underpaid and standing military is probably a big drain on the resources of a country. Still, it makes for a fun and interesting story. <br><br>Speaking of which, I was in the big smoke yesterday so I popped in to the theatre to see the new Star Wars film. Very nice work, although I would like a bit more dialogue – which is I believe intentionally reduced because the Chinese audiences don’t like films with too many subtitles (as do English speaking audiences too), still it was very good. The interesting thing is that when I left home here I noted that the temperature was 33'C (91.4'F), but when I got to the big smoke it was 39'C (102.2'F) and I was thinking to myself how unpleasantly hot it was (and still is, by the way).<br><br>I later checked the official statistics and noticed something really weird. The official weather station reported the maximum temperature for the day as 34'C (93.2'F) and I was thinking to myself - no way is that correct! And then a little bulb of insight popped into my head as a I recalled that (and I may have mentioned this to you earlier this year): <a href=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/la-trobe-street-weather-station-closes-after-107-years-20150106-12irxc.html rel=nofollow>La Trobe Street weather station closes after 107 years </a>.<br><br>Yes, take the official weather station that has been at the same place for 107 years, where it resides on a corner between a 6 lane road and a 4 lane road and then earlier this year it was moved into a parkland which is close to a very large and deep salt water estuary. That is such a genius idea, I never would have thought of that myself! Kudos to them it appears to be a case of: if you can’t fix the core, fix the statistics! Of course, it is a PR exercise. I did also note that it was reported briefly that Chinese hackers had gotten into the Bureau of Meteorology's computer systems in the past few weeks too. Interesting times.<br><br>Liked the drone shoot too! :-)! I hope to never see one of those things.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br>PS: I've got a new blog entry up: <a href=http://ferngladefarm.blogspot.com.au/ rel=nofollow>An inconvenient shed</a>. I fess up to my unsavoury enjoyment of Christmas lights (they're quite rare down here so it has novelty value). There is also more on the very crazy weather situation down here - bush fires that wiped out one third of a town as well as records smashed across the continent. And massive floods up north which may deliver huge salt water crocodiles to your front door. Oh yeah, I preserved half a year’s supply of apricots. Yum! A big tree branch fell (almost fatally on me!) from a water stressed tree. And I've been busy repurposing the old chicken shed into a new and heavy duty fire wood shed. Plus there is a very cool photo of one of the native bees on a salvia flower!

You just need to make sure it can't do it's job and can't make the return trip back to its owners. So an arrow stuck in the wing or body, if heavy enough and with enough added drag, is likely to be the end of the vehicle. Airborne vehicles don't have a lot of margin; they are generally pretty fragile. Putting protection on them (like an A-10) costs payload and range, it's unlikely a small drone would have much tolerance for damage. <br><br>That said, can I take credit for being the first of your readers to actually shoot at and (I think) hit a drone? I had one over my house a few months ago - a toy, not a military device. I figured my airspace is my property and I don't like peeping toms. I shot at it with the only thing I had immediately available - a single shot air rifle. I got off three shots - I heard the last shot go 'pling' and the drone left. I don't think I knocked it down, but it has never come back. Hopefully the owner got the message. So at least in this case, the damage from a random hit from an air rifle wasn't enough to bring it down immediately, but I don't think it would take much more...<br><br><a href=retrotopia-neglected-technologies.html#c96727293981838495 title="comment permalink">12/31/15, 4:41 AM</a><br><br>

This tube and its mates took the DC power generated up north and converted it to 500 kv AC for grid distribution in the south.

Effective jamming technology may be beyond most Afghan peasants but I’m sure that your Lakeland Republic is an altogether more formidable opponent. Of course in fifty years drones may well be much more, if not entirely autonomous. The weak link here is likely the on-board sensors and decision making software. Any software that controls a small fast moving aircraft flying close to obstacles like trees will I guess, need to be fairly simple and fast. In which case it should be possible to fool it, if you understand how it functions. Mr Carr did not ask but it’s a safe guess that those “real drones” from Chicago will have been thoroughly reverse engineered, studied and re-assembled before being handed over to the happy snipers. <br>I suspect that drones are largely an exercise in propaganda. Mr Obama announces that the terrorists (somehow he always sounds as if he’s saying tourists) have been “taken out”, we see some grainy footage of some blokes standing around, then, poof they’re gone, a car is seen travelling through the desert full of terrorists, (they could be tourists for all we know), the crosshairs settle on the vehicle and a moment later they’re history. Have any of these drone strikes had any effect on the outcome of any of the utterly pointless and interminable wars that America and its gang of hangers on have got into over the last fifteen years?<br>In truth terrorism (not tourism that’s fine) is really nothing but publicity stunts carried out by people who are otherwise powerless to affect events. Britain was subjected to a concerted campaign of terror (well-funded by Washington and Libya) by the IRA for over thirty years. As far as anyone knows it had no real impact on the British economy or society. The funny thing was that it only ended when the British Government admitted that they would never defeat the IRA and we would just have to learn to live with it, a bit like road traffic accidents and cancer. At the same time the British media got bored with reporting yet another outrage and gradually relegated them to the back pages along with sport and skate boarding dogs. I guess that in the end Gerry and his mates finally got fed up with looking in the mirror, seeing themselves getting greyer and greyer with nothing to show for a lifetime dedicated to the cause. In the end they sold out to the Brits for a role in local government.<br>Mike<br><br><a href=retrotopia-neglected-technologies.html#c5944311619068277429 title="comment permalink">12/31/15, 7:47 AM</a><br><br>

There are details of making his highest capacity systems that he leaves out of his youtube channel, but there are enough details to make a system that is still pretty good. I am currently trying to make some of the chemicals for testing what an amateur could make. What I find interesting about this technology is that it doesn't require dangerous or especially hard to get resources, and can make a battery that competes handily with lead acid. The fact that they are made on benches and not wearing gloves makes me suspect that a local specialist, running a shop not too different from an old fashion chemist shop could produce them, and at prices that might be sustainable, assuming that there is demand enough for electricity in niche applications.<br><br>The bigger question is what electricity would be used for. Shooting down drones, I would not be the lease surprised if the power source for Emily's Maser-beam would be derived from such a technology.<br><br>Personally when I think of the use of electricity in the post industrial world their are two uses that spring to the front of my mind for home use. Light and radio. Temperature and motion I think are practicle to get through a wide range of sources, but electricity can be a good source of light, and radio pretty much requires it. Of course I am picturing an electrical budget that figures on Watt hours more often than Kilowatt hours.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-neglected-technologies.html#c3259715986362519750 title="comment permalink">12/31/15, 9:18 AM</a><br><br>

There's nothing quite like taking some concentrated nitric acid meant for testing gold, some concentrated sulfuric acid, and food-grade glycerol. Measure out some sulfuric acid and half that amount of nitric acid. Slowly mix them together, keeping in mind that this is extremely exothermic and the mixture will heat up rapidly (obviously, safety goggles and gloves are your friends). Then put it in the refrigerator and wait until it cools down to &lt;10 C. Now slowly add a few drops (I wouldn't advise more than 10 drops) of the glycerol, and wait a while until you see little globs of yellowish nitroglycerin accumulating at the bottom. Carefully pipet it out, put it in a test tube, neutralize with a sodium bicarbonate solution, and you're done! I found that if I pipetted two drops of NG, put it on a concrete patio, and hit it with a hammer, the explosion was easily as loud as a gunshot or firecracker and enough to leave me with some hearing loss for the rest of the day, after which I discovered that earplugs were a good idea. ;)<br><br>This sort of thing is sufficient to hook any teenager with half a neuron on chemistry. Modern high school labs, where they exist at all, won't touch anything remotely dangerous with a ten-foot pole for fear of lawsuits, which drives down the number of people interested in science. Even worse, it makes it much less common for people to tinker with rudimentary scientific equipment at their own homes and learn in a hands-on, undirected way without any institution over their shoulders. Granted a few people will get hurt, but it's worth having lots of people who can actually do science themselves and tinker with whatever is at their disposal, rather than just answer test questions and do labs only in a predetermined, step-by-step way.<br><br>The good news is that this can be remedied - real chemistry sets are hard to come by, but all the chemicals and equipment you could need are available quite cheaply online. In particular, the Chinese will sell anyone anything. The only caution is to look up lists of chemicals that are used to make meth, and make sure what you're buying is not on those lists (unless it's something extremely common with large numbers of innocent uses, like sulfuric acid). As long as you get only small quantities and don't look like you're making meth, Big Brother will generally stay off your back.<br><br>Helpful website: http://www.sciencemadness.org/<br><br><a href=retrotopia-neglected-technologies.html#c4251554794423964984 title="comment permalink">12/31/15, 9:35 AM</a><br><br>

Statically stable aircraft will respond to a disturbance (say turbulence) by returning to stable flight at whatever attitude they are trimmed for. Dynamically stable aircraft will maintain the same attitude they had before after a disturbance, but require the pilot or control system to kill the oscillations. Dynamically unstable aircraft require a control system to maintain stability because any deviation from stable flight will tend to grow rather than shrink.<br><br>What we think of as drones (multirotor aircraft) are dynamically unstable and require quick and accurate adjustments to their control inputs to maintain controlled flight. This is probably possible without semiconductors, but I wouldn't count on it. That being said, some sort of vacuum tube that works as an accelerometer and gyroscope in a similar fashion to the MEMS chips you can buy for $1 today that do the job in hobby drones is likely technically possible, nobody has invented it though. However, a multirotor also requires very powerful, light motors and lithium-ion batteries to be technically viable, and those might not be available in 2065. The vacuum tube gyro though... it probably existed during the 1950-70s, we were probably not supposed to know about it at the time, and it would be considered irrelevant (except probably by the Russians and Chinese) now.<br><br>However, a drone that looks like a conventional helicopter or airplane could easily be statically stable, and would not require any feedback control to fly, and could easily work with vacuum tube technology. However, beyond line of sight control would be a challenge (by no means an impossible one) without semiconductors due to the need to relay video and telemetry back to the ground station.<br><br>That being said, a powerful spark gap transmitter powered by a car alternator and a small gasoline engine would probably put a stop to most radio-based military technology whether it used vacuum tubes or not. Considering that it's far simpler to build a spark gap transmitter than any of the other things I talked about, it's likely that the LR would use those in situations where denying the entire radio spectrum to both sides made strategic sense.

I was a soldier for most of my adult life and had been many things in that time, to include part of the Army's professional opposing force (OpFor).<br>One of the things I remember from being OpFor is that drones are easily killed or easily avoided by people who are trained to do so. OpFor at JRTC learned how to hide from drones so well they were useless and OpFor at NTC usually killed all the drones shortly after the battles began. You, and Pappas, are right. Current drones can not survive anyone that can fight back against them. <br>I honestly feel drones are a military fad, which are actually quite common, and will never provide much of a real combat force. They are not much more capable than a WWII aircraft and suffer from operator lag time from the radio link; the only advantage is they are small. Unless they fly high, they can be easily hit by ground fire and the lag time becomes a larger factor in their survivablility. Against an enemy with actual ADA, or air assests, they can not survive at altitude. I imagine they will remain as a tool for direct observation but they will become simpler and cheaper so they can be disposable.<br>I think a .50 cal would be too big for a drone but if the soldiers were trained for anti-material gunning and sniping, I could see the use. Capping a tank's commander will seriously degrade the tanks ability to fight, knocking out the tank gunner's or commander's sights would also seriously degrade their ability to fight. A .50 cal would do both of those with honors. I also figure that these soldiers operate on the "chopping cord wood" tactic of the Finnish troops during their war with the Soviets. Snipers are very important for such a tactic. <br>I think you place a little too much faith on ADA guns, though. I mean, I think ADA guns are very good at low altitude but beyond that you would still need missiles. As an example, the Soviet ZSU-23-4 with simple 23mm guns and a vacuum tube fire control computer is still one of the deadliest ADA guns in existance and the USAF will not fly low altitude where such guns operate. Higher than that, you would still need some missiles in your ADA mix. The thing is missiles are actually far lower tech than what people believe. It takes a lot to overcome ADA, we have spent a fortune making counter-measures and stealth aircraft to defeat '60s era Soviet missiles and we still don't know if it will work since the last time we were in a shooting war with a country that had an interlocked and intergrated ADA system was North Vietnam. Don't get me wrong, with a good fire control computer and radar, I believe guns might be effective but you would need a large volume of fire and proximty rounds. Also, missiles are cheaper and use less resources than the aircraft they will be shooting down. The same is true with anti-tank missiles and antiship missiles. <br>I have much I could go on about this topic but I should stop before being a bore. Again, I've enjoyed the stories and the rest of your articles.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-neglected-technologies.html#c3827286209534444781 title="comment permalink">12/31/15, 10:22 AM</a><br><br>

Thank you so much for putting the time into this lively and thought provoking project. Every post gets me thinking, as in hmmm, I'd put buried landlines (telegraph and single channel voice) to every level of government, armory, bank and post office in the LR, irregardless of the county's chosen technology level.. And hmm, why didn't Peter Carr notice the woodlands on his train ride in? A society that burns wood for heat (less of that, back to nice cozy three piece suits) and cooking needs extensive managed woodlots. And hmm, now wait a just a cotton-picking second, that brilliant 19th century metallurgy requires coking coal and iron ore, both non-renewable resources that the LR would have to squeeze out of played out 20th century mines. Could be. Also could be a most dangerous line of work. Maybe they could get another country to sell them a pile of vanadium, left over from refining the sour sludge of played out 20th century oil fields, to temper their steel. And similarly, hmm, where are they getting the silver, for photographic processes? Much too useful stuff to circulate as coinage.<br><br>And basing Lakeland Republic technology on vacuum tubes is just brilliant. Ever since we closed the last incandescent lightbulb factory in the country a few years back, I have been grousing that we have put ourselves in a position where we are dependent on a semiconductor foundry on the other side of the world to turn on a light bulb. And we call it progress. Vacuum tubes can be made with workshop level technology.

This would cause the drones to be more expensive and have smaller payloads as well as making any usefull weapons they would carry much more expensive and sophisticated. This would put the attacking force in the position of spending 100 of 1000's of dollars to destroy a sandbag sniper nest that cost $500 total. This is of course much the same position the U.S. finds itself in when it uses a $100,000 hellfire missle to take out a pashtun rebel on a mule.

Canister shot was by American anti-tank guns in World War II to give them an effective anti-infantry capability. I've seen photos of 37 mm AT guns employing canister in jungle battles against the Japanese in the South Pacific.<br><br>The US Army also used what were known as beehive rounds during the Vietnam War. These were 105 mm and 155 mm artillery shells packed with flechettes and detonated above the target by a time fuse, much like the old Civil War and World War I shrapnel shells. I read Colonel Duquesne Wolf's account of his experiences as a brigade commander in Vietnam and how devastating beehive shells were against infantry caught out in the open. Beehive rounds were developed for other calibers as well.<br><br>Both concepts were resurrected during the occupation of Iraq for use in tank cannons. American tank soldiers in particular found that canister shot was ideally suited for blowing a hole in the wall of a building so that friendly infantry could enter without having go in through one of the doors or windows (infantrymen quickly learn in urban combat that if you have to enter an enemy held building, its best not to do so through a door or other obvious entrance since you can bet those are being watched and covered by fire).<br><br><a href=retrotopia-neglected-technologies.html#c6219977818072369711 title="comment permalink">12/31/15, 1:00 PM</a><br><br>

It's an improvement on the conventional zeppelin which requires far less ground infrastructure (it can land unaided on pretty much any flat surface, including water), and has a much better gas volume to payload ratio that could make it viable for cargo transportation. The California based company Worldwide Aeros has tested a prototype and is currently looking for money to manufacture larger vessels capable of carrying commercial cargo. Currently, the ships are filled with helium, but hydrogen could provide a non-fossil fuel dependent substitute.<br><br>I do think that this technology has potential as a part of the future of cargo transportation, and has a unique advantage in a period where large infrastructure projects are becoming harder to construct and maintain. <br><br>http://aeroscraft.com/technology-copy/4580412172<br><br><a href=retrotopia-neglected-technologies.html#c9037929753460051322 title="comment permalink">12/31/15, 4:07 PM</a><br><br>

Carr himself has mentioned that he has been interested in the problem of satellite collisions for over a dozen years - the so-called Kessler syndrome - and has been following the news of a recent collision when he was in Toledo.<br> What if his mission here is to see if the Republic is ever invaded again, that they might invoke a Samson option. What I am talking about are several basic-tech missiles packed full of shrapnel that would be launched into orbit set to explode and threw out millions of lethal fragments that would put an end to most, if not all, space missions. Due to the Republic's low-tech, there would be little effect on it but it would cripple a 2065 civilization. If this became known, then no country, particularly the Atlantic Republic, would ever allow such an invasion to ever occur.<br> There is a precedent for this idea. When the US made active moves to weaponize space so that they could "dominate" that domain, the 2007 Chinese anti-satellite missile test which created some 150,000 debris particles was a message that if the US tried that, then they could expect to lose ALL access to space itself.<br> In reading this week's post and some of the comments, I wonder too how many of them could be made applicable in taking out satellites in orbit.Just a thought.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-neglected-technologies.html#c2185006887487356462 title="comment permalink">12/31/15, 9:56 PM</a><br><br>

Yes, we'll be discussing that further as the story continues. <br><br>Penumbra, thanks for the reminder! That's a very good example of what I suppose out to be called tactical technological regression -- something that may play a very large role in the future. <br><br>Dau, duly noted -- I admit it's not on my very small to-watch list. <br><br>Cherokee, if the US was paying attention it would realize that its aircraft carriers are sitting ducks in anything approximating real combat; I figure the drone fleets owned by the Atlantic Republic et al. fall into the same category. If you do see a drone, by the way, the small hobby drones can be taken out very gracefully by low-tech means -- a stone powered by a sling comes to mind. <br><br>Clarence, not unless it's old technology; this is <i>Retro</i>topia, after all. <br><br>Migrant, exactly! Half of what makes the current triumphalist rhetoric about progress so absurd is that it assumes, on the basis of nothing more than blind faith, that every time our society replaces thing A with thing B, B is not only better than A but better than all the competing technologies vying for A's spot, now or in the past. <br><br>Five8Charlie, sure, but there's something soul-satisfying about seeing a drone vanish in a billowing bubble of flame, and have burning fragments tumble down to the ground, you have to admit. <br><br>Noni Mausa, I've never seen one that big! Those would be impressive. Ordinary high-end transmitter tubes can be pretty cool, and the gentle glow from little tubes has its own charm.<br><br>Nate, thanks for the heads up. I find it completely plausible that K-3 civilizations would turn out to be N=0; in fact, it seems most likely to me that K-2 civilizations are equally numerous, and K-1 civilizations (those that use all the energy resources of a single planet) would be shortlived and messily self-terminating. But of course you knew that...<br><br>Uncannily, the emergence of Hackerspaces and Makerspaces are among the more genuinely hopeful signs I've seen in the last decade or so. <br><br>LatheChuck, fascinating. I confess with some embarrassment that I like, and make much use of, the word processor's capacity to handle repeated small revisions -- I edit my work in multiple passes, changing a word here, a sentence there, tightening and cleaning up a rough draft in stages until it says what I want it to say -- but I have a very nice manual typewriter, an Olivetti Lettera 22 in exquisite condition, and should probably get some practice with it as time permits.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-neglected-technologies.html#c7227215738643529848 title="comment permalink">12/31/15, 9:57 PM</a><br><br>

Build that radio -- and get some target time in with those slingshots!<br><br>Andrew, I seriously considered chain shot; the advantage of canister shot, though, is that you don't need to be anything like so good at aiming. <br><br>Bernhard, I've had a couple of inquiries, but haven't yet been able to interest a German publisher. If you know any small publishers that might be interested, please let 'em know that the rights are available!<br><br>Eric, I'd recommend some whimsy -- enough that it keeps people from getting too pompous, not enough to attract people whose sole interest is the trappings of pop fantasy fiction. <br><br>Mikep, I'm quite sure Carr isn't being shown everything the Lakeland Republic has up its sleeve! As with most things military, the best defense against the other guy's technology is to have a range of different ways to mess with it, so that nobody can predict what's going to hit them first. That kind of uncertainty makes a good deterrent. <br><br>Avalterra, that'll be next week. <br><br>Ray, light and radio were the standard uses for electricity in rural America when the most common power source was batteries charged by a windmill, so I think you're on the right track. <br><br>Grebulocities, I'm not a great fan of nitroglycerin, but whatever boils your retort!<br><br>William, you asked me why I didn't put modern, high-altitude drones into my scenario, which I'd already explained. If you wanted to say "I think your scenario is inaccurate," that's a different matter -- but I think you're letting yourself be sold on a gizmocentric fantasy. <br><br>Tommy, thanks for the details! I appreciate hearing from someone who actually works with these things. I have no doubt that the Lakeland Army's AA guns use proximity fuses -- that's old tech, after all -- but you're doubtless right about missiles; I simply don't know enough about ADA missile guidance systems to know how low tech you can go and still hit an enemy plane. <br><br>Celt, you're certainly right about coke, but the iron ore used in the Lakeland Republic comes from dismantled skyscrapers and freeway bridges. Wood is used as a fuel, but a lot of rural areas use methane from manure for cooking. Silver and vanadium? Now that the borders are open again, no doubt they'll be trading for a variety of metals, among other things. <br><br>Clay, exactly. As noted in the episode two weeks ago, the entire military strategy of the Lakeland Republic consists of bankrupting its opponents -- easier to do in a world where none of its likely opponents dominates the world's financial infrastructure (and so can print as much money as it wants).<br><br><a href=retrotopia-neglected-technologies.html#c5690572900004456314 title="comment permalink">12/31/15, 10:16 PM</a><br><br>

Notice that the Franken's maser isn't an advance on existing technology; it's a deliberate return to an older technology, which is then perfected beyond its 1950s level. Pay attention to that; it's going to become a continuing theme. <br><br>Lynford, I've more than occasionally thought that alcohol-fueled ultralights may be viable straight through the deindustrial dark age; one of these days I may write a story, or a series of stories, set in a dark age warrior culture where the heroes fly ultralights into battle and the long rifle (along the lines of the Kentucky long rifle) has the same sort of ambience that swords had in the last set of dark ages. <br><br>Celt, thanks for the heads up. Given recent plunges in the commodities markets and indicators of shipping, your warning sign may be well timed. <br><br>Paul, now there's a blast from the past! Many thanks for the link. <br><br>Keith, that's embarrassing -- and typical. I assume you've noticed that "labor and time saving technology" always costs more labor and time...<br><br>Buddha, congrats! If I lived there you'd have my vote. <br><br>Blueback, thanks for the info -- I wasn't aware of that. <br><br>Pantagruel, not at all. A wood-and-fabric triplane of World War I vintage with a couple of good forward-firing machine guns would be effectively invisible to radar and proximity-fused antiaircraft shells, and would likely wreak havoc on low-flying subsonic drones. See Penunbra's comment above about the biplane attack on the Italian Navy!<br><br>Shane, it depends on when the melting finishes. Remember that Europe, for example, had all the resources necessary to sustain an industrial society for millennia before anyone got around to using them for that purpose. If it takes long enough for Antarctica to finish melting that industrial civilization is a evil memory from the distant past, no one may ever get around to it there. <br><br>Ezra, interesting. Since this is, ahem, <i>Retro</i>topia, I'm going to be focusing on old technology, but we'll see. <br><br>Rabtter, yes, that'd probably do it. <br><br>Inohuri, you could fly B-17s near a nuclear explosion because they didn't have any solid state electronics (i.e., transistors or integrated circuits). Vacuum tubes are invulnerable to electromagnetic pulses; it's solid state components that go "pfft!" when an EMP comes along. <br><br>Kevin, I have to confess that your last comment got me thinking of somebody leaning out the hatch of a space capsule with a drawn longbow, aiming at a satellite! As for Carr's mission, stay tuned; there's quite a bit more to the story. All I'll say now is that the Kessler syndrome, which will get more attention as we proceed, is one of several plot engines...<br><br><a href=retrotopia-neglected-technologies.html#c9054146220727601822 title="comment permalink">12/31/15, 10:34 PM</a><br><br>

The first failed to find Bismarck. The second strike scored two hits, one of which jammed Bismarck '​s rudders with 15° port helm on.[8] This made Bismarck unmanoeuvrable, and unable to escape to France; it sank after intense Royal Navy attack within 13 hours. The low speed of the attacking aircraft may have acted in their favour, as the planes were too slow for the fire-control predictors of the German gunners, whose shells exploded so far in front of the aircraft that the threat of shrapnel damage was greatly diminished. At least some of the Swordfish flew so low that most of Bismarck's flak weapons could not depress enough to hit them.[9]"<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairey_Swordfish<br><br>1942 onward female Russian military aviators. <br>"The regiment flew in wood-and-canvas Polikarpov Po-2 biplanes, a 1928 design intended for use as training aircraft and for crop-dusting, and to this day the most-produced biplane in aviation history. The planes could carry only six bombs at a time, so multiple missions per night were necessary. Although the aircraft were obsolete and slow, the pilots made daring use of their exceptional maneuverability; they had the advantage of having a maximum speed that was lower than the stall speed of both the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and the Focke-Wulf Fw 190, and as a result, German pilots found them very difficult to shoot down. An attack technique of the night bombers was to idle the engine near the target and glide to the bomb release point, with only wind noise left to reveal their location. German soldiers likened the sound to broomsticks and named the pilots "Night Witches."[4] <br>"It was the most highly decorated female unit in the Soviet Air Force, each pilot having flown over 800 missions by the end of the war..."<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Witches<br><br><a href=retrotopia-neglected-technologies.html#c957136506289443159 title="comment permalink">1/1/16, 12:51 AM</a><br><br>

We don’t hear much about such things down here, other than coal seam gas extraction (i.e. the polite name for fracking down here) is becoming uneconomic at current oil prices. I read somewhere that they require at least US$55/barrel (from memory) for it to be economic and yet the companies have committed so much capital to the LNG refineries that they have to continue – even with the low oil prices.<br><br>You know what though? I'm honestly surprised at how resilient the economy actually is and the sheer number of ploys being thrown at it to keep it afloat. You have to admit that it is impressive? I may have mentioned to you previously that the number one game in town is keeping inflation in check - and given that we are currently experiencing stagflation (as you quite rightly previously pointed out), my best guess at this stage is that pretty much anything goes now that will keep inflation in check - even if that means throwing large portions of the working population under the bus to achieve that objective. Because keeping inflation in check ultimately means retaining some semblance of control and submission. They may have learned from history?<br><br>My gut feel now tells me that given the incredible shift in the climate currently underway, we may see an interesting intersection of stresses between the environment and the economy. Dunno, but that is what my gut feeling is telling me now as any recovery process from environmental disasters requires real wealth, whereas the economy, well, it can sustain a fair bit of magic - in your understanding of that word.<br><br>Again, the process is slow and unfolding gradually rather than reaching a tipping point. We're really a lot like the story of the frog adapting to the slowly heating water and forget to notice that the water is actually getting hotter until we suddenly cark it!<br><br>Anyway, I'm hopefully shifting another two cubic metres of manure tomorrow into the orchard as I don't reckon that there is any other game in town worth playing. Maybe that is my bias though?<br><br>PS: Forgot to add that I really like how the Lakeland Republic drone shooters have to prove their systems on the ground in a most public manner. Wouldn't it be fun if the F-35 (which we are also involved in and are up to our eye balls) had to prove itself in a public forum?

This one youtube video shows shotgun-tipped arrows working after a little bit of experimentation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dmhyWvhjDI. As an added bonus, it seems that the majority of these shotgun shell tipped arrows can be salvaged for reuse without damage to the arrow shaft! Also for safety, it seems that the arrows don't explode on soft-targets (watermelons), but explode on hard targets (metal soda cans), and so might work against drones. <br><br>Re: aiming problems from inohuri: Good archers don't aim for where the target is, but where it's going to be. That takes practice, and a lot of it. Hitting a stationary target is better, but we can judge distance mentally on the fly. That being said, even pulling one of my lightweight warbows with such a heavy grain explosive arrow tip, I would likely only be able to hit a drone accurately within 40 yards. Again, I see this weapon being used, if at all, by Lakeland during an invasion as part of irregular forces. There will be no medieval longbow battles with both sides loosing volleys at each other, but a few archers running around the woods doing hit-and-run ambushes on convoys and low-flying drones can be devastating.

In years past I used to see signs posted on utility poles around my home advertising house calls made by the Sewing Machine Doctor. I never used this service, but there are still places to go where I live to get a sewing machine fixed. My recent experience was with two Phaff machines, one 60+ years old and one maybe 30 in two different stores. Guess which was was able to be repaired. The older one, all metal parts. The newer one had nylon gears that were cracked and it would not be able to be repaired. I think there is a real place for sewing machine repair that could make someone a living even now. Also maybe even machining new gears to replace plastic ones could be another job. Forget electronic ones. I have never thought they were as good as the built-like-a-brick mechanical ones.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-neglected-technologies.html#c5290316846997983906 title="comment permalink">1/1/16, 11:56 AM</a><br><br>

Man-lifting kites have proven dangerous to the point of being suicidal, and it's hard to see them working any better for any mission in an era of powered aircraft and rifled firearms. But wind permitting, a thousand kids flying a thousand ordinary box kites could interdict drones from an airspace at least a mile square, below 500 feet or so. There would have to be a good reason, and a limited time window, because that's also a lot of effort (kids' time presumably not being considered worth less than nothing in Lakeland as it is in the present-day U.S.).<br><br>In RetroCartoonTopia, you could put a wig, dress, and false eyelashes on a drone, and use it to lure all the attacking drones away.<br><br>Obviously, the Lakeland Republic has reformed our present tort system.

Interstellar travel even with a probe in a human time scale would take so much energy and money that I doubt any government or corporation would bother to even try that either. Renewable energy may be renewable but renewable technologies arent. From the looks of things I'm not sure if there is enough economically extractable rare earth metals (among other things) to power the world on renewables at U.S levels, at least not for very long anyway.

Or 186 to 192 MHz in the band plan of that locale/era. <br><br>The antenna was connected with a coax. This differs from a waveguide in that there is a center conductor. In the VHF band, a waveguide would be prohibitively large, awkward, and expensive. It was a pipe, because there was a smaller pipe in the center. The center was also a pipe to save weight and expense, though there must have been a fortune invested in copper going up that 1000' tower. In a coax, the current runs in opposite directions in the center and outside conductors, so that everything cancels and no energy escapes along the length of the coax. A single pipe would radiate along its entire length at that wavelength. <br><br>The STL was microwave, I don't remember which band. It used a little TWT amplifier, and its signal went through waveguide indoors, and a parabolic dish formed a beam from/to a similar dish and transceiver at the studio. Pretty much bog-standard microwave communication. The telco uses similar things today for long-distance high-speed links, but the TWT has been replace with some solid-state thing, though I'm not sure what.<br><br>When the wavelength is short enough, the center conductor becomes redundant, or an impediment. Then one simply uses a hollow tube. At even shorter wavelengths, one uses an optical fiber.

The burdens on JMG, as a weekly essayist, are surely severe. We do best not to imitate his heroic literary example in its full severity when launching our own venture. <br><br>We should be announcing blog-launch details here on ADR later in January. <br><br>The envisaged blog will be open to courteous, germane comment from anyone, whether Catholic or not, subject only to the same rules regarding courtesy and relevance that JMG himself successfully enforces on ADR. <br><br>As I have remarked before, the envisaged blog gives us a chance to air topics of current theory-of-catabolic-collapse interest, as raised on ADR, from a rather Roman perspective. We will be able to do so without fearing that we clutter JMG's good Web space with billowing, intrusive clouds of Roman incense. <br><br>Is Byzantium an example of a jurisdiction that managed catabolic collapse successfully? How does one start reading Augustine, and how closely does his situation parallel our own? How does one battle temptations to despair, as one probes the hollowness of the COP21 Paris agreement? What parts of <i>Laudato Si'</i> now most urgently require rereading? Why, oh why, does it seem such fun in an era of social decline to work with beeswax, or to ponder bookbinding, or to listen to chant from Silos? Is Opus Dei a Good Thing? How should a Catholic respond to that ancient debating-club resolution, 'That America is a Good Thing, and ought to be kept'? Is pacifism mandatory for Catholics contemplating drone-shoots? Ours will be the place to thrash such things out. <br><br>My next task tonight is to send an e-mail to all the relevant people. I believe that my duty is to write tonight to the following: the Catholics Brien (in North America), Andrea J. (in a large, warm, normally dry European Union country), and Brian (in a small, cool, damp European Union country); and additionally a theological dissident, not presently in formal communion with Rome, who blogs on ADR under the name 'Nestorian'. If I have everything right, that means one e-mail transmission from my desk tonight, going out to four people. <br><br>I would be keen to be told urgently <i>(a)</i> if I have missed anyone, and <i>(b)</i>if any additional individual would like to take this late opportunity to add himself or herself to our little blog-seeding collective. (I mean, in other words, to take this late opportunity to become a potential blog administrator or blog essayist, as opposed to a mere blog commentator. Once the blog is launched, mere commenting will - to reiterate - be open to all and sundry.)<br><br>Any urgent communications asking to be added to the collective of blog-seeders are best made via private e-mail to Toomas(dot)Karmo(at)gmail(dot)com, or by dialling my (Canadian) cellular phone (647-267-9566). <br><br>Now let me try to sum up the key point as that feisty ecclesial Latinist Reginald Foster perhaps would: <i>Nuntio vobis gaudium magnum - habemus, vel habebimus, tabulam interretialem sententiarum scribendarum (anglice 'bloggum').</i> - <i>I announce to you a great joy - we have, or will be having, an Internet table-for-the-writing-of-opinions (in English, a "blog")</i>. <br><br><br>Gaudens, <br><br><br>Toomas = Tom (Karmo) <br><br>in Richmond Hill, Ontario<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-neglected-technologies.html#c4338688817196599348 title="comment permalink">1/1/16, 8:38 PM</a><br><br>

When the local junior college got rid of all the useful hands-on blue collar "trade" classes like clothing design and metal and woodworking in favor of sexy "IT", all the associated machinery was sold off for pennies on the $ or even given away. I scored a beautiful industrial Consew complete with built-in table at price of $0. It only does a straight stitch, but for 90% of jobs that's enough. For the rest, I've got an old all-metal domestic Singer which, with its replaceable "cams" and various levers, can do about 25 different stitch patterns. <br>The modern "electronic" machines are mostly plastic throwaway crap with heaps of useless "features". The all-metal machines tend to last for many years if properly lubricated. <br>Adjusting a sewing machine when it goes "out of timing" is fairly easy, and the basic principles are relevant to almost all simple single needle machines. <br>My mom taught me to sew when I was around 11 (she thought it was appropriate for a boy bless her heart), and the skill has come in very handy over the years, especially in my 17 years sailing around the pacific on my 3 cruising yachts. <br>There definitely is a niche for sewing machine repair.

My comment about blondes had obviously to do with changing sexual steretypes over times. I found this quote by wikipedia on the play:<br><br>Influence on 20th-century theatre<br><br>By the close of the 19th century, melodrama began to disappear from the theater. More and more, the focus was on a style of acting called dramatic naturalism.[6]<br><br>By the time A Streetcar Named Desire was written and produced, melodrama was in its last stages and Blanche DuBois's memorable personality used it to illustrate exactly how misleading melodramatic acting could be.<br><br>Exaggerated sighs, unnecessary screams of distress, and fluttery hand gestures are all employed by Blanche throughout the play. Dramatic lines about needing rescuing (which are now often seen as clichéd) are an internal part of Blanche's working. They veil her true personality (that of a sick, unbalanced woman) and allow her to play with men like Mitch, who falls for her histrionics and becomes convinced he will be her savior."<br><br>I saw on New Year's Eve the 4th part of Panem hunger games with my family. This could arguably be a sort of post PO future novel. The wikipedia comments that sex differences are deliberately eliminated with only a couple of steretypical female figures.

I see that in just 40 years car use has weakened individuals globally to where obesity and diabetes are global epidemics and finding good candidates for military service among young US males or slim sexy mating partners in younger age groups is becoming difficult on a staistical basis according to my reading in US. I recall reading of the extremely brutal transformation of life in early industrialized England and we have seen similar happen since 1979 in China. Parallels in changes in tech to body public can be expected again. I sat for years in an office and now have been a labourer for some years. One changes.<br><br>Will we become healthy, slim, sexy and return to stereotypical sexual historical norms when kitchen and house work is deautomated along with clothing and food production? This is controversial of course and perhaps not to the topic. When I read such a blog entry though, although I enjoy the technical part, I cannot help myself thinking of naive star trek episodes playing hundreds of years in the future with mini skirts from 60s. In other words current social norms are taken on without criticism to avoid controversy. Here in the schools girls are encouraged to do technical careers and boys to become kindergarten teachers. Needless to say this sort of thing only goes so far. <br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-neglected-technologies.html#c2162075775338333918 title="comment permalink">1/2/16, 7:35 AM</a><br><br>

I've noticed that a light lofted by a kite at night creates a strong illusion of being a much larger object at a much greater distance, and therefore of moving very quickly. And because even single-line kites tend to move in ways that are impossible for most free-flying aircraft (because the aerodynamic forces on them are levered against the tension of their tether), they make a very strange impression. Quite a few UFO accounts describe lights low above the horizon in the distance, hovering and "darting" about with rapid changes of direction, and I've always wondered whether the "aliens" have historically preferred windy nights for engaging in such displays.<br><br>Aha... now I've got to turn into an Uncle's Mile story. :D<br><br><a href=retrotopia-neglected-technologies.html#c329001597055402703 title="comment permalink">1/2/16, 2:12 PM</a><br><br>

I start with tabula retialis, with the "inter" part understood, and hope for a rule that elides the r between a short "a" and a long "e".

I have trouble gauging how much support these "sovereign" militia types really have, even among the ranching community.

'Interrete' is a now generally accepted term for 'Internet'. 'Interretialis' (in masculine and feminine nominative singular; for neuter nominative singular, 'interretiale') is a correct form for 'of or pertaining to the Internet'. 'Tabula' can, as you remark, mean a plank or a table, for example for eating on, and has also a legal or literary meaning: a 'tabula' can be a rather formal list, or publication, or plaque, or noticeboard, including a noticeboard onto which some public authority has put some proclamation - and of course your 'log', in the special sense of 'formal, and rather public, record'. 'Tabula interretialis' is 'Internet noticeboard' or 'Internet thing-put-up-for-citizens-to-read'. <br><br>Yes, you are quite right: 'blog' is barbaric. We have this kind of struggle nowadays in Estonian (where people say 'okei' to signify assent, where 'hea k¨ll' would do perfectly well, and 'sorri' to convey an apology, where 'vabandust' would do perfectly well; what the USSR could not do in a half century of Rule by Frankenstein, America seems to be achieving without trying). As you point out, French has similar miseries - I recall <i>Schweppes, le drink des gen raffinés</i> ('Schweppes, the drink of refined folk') from dreary 1970s magazine adverts; also 'le smoking' (for 'dinnerjacket', or in America English 'tuxedo'), and 'le parking'. <br><br>I herewith resolve to abandon 'blog' in Latin. The authority in Polska at <a href=http://www.obta.uw.edu.pl/~draco/docs/voccomp.html rel=nofollow>http://www.obta.uw.edu.pl/~draco/docs/voccomp.html</a> reflects the cyberculture of the 1990s, not of 2016, and so fails to provide a substitute. The problem has likely been solved by the guys over in Suomi doing those Latin news broadcasts, or by some similar recent authority, but I have not yet started digging. <br><br>By the way, soomlased/suomalaiset/Finns have in their own language (as opposed to the Latin in which they have been doing the just-cited broadcasting) setting the Nordic world at least one conspicuous example of good practice. The eestlased say, alas, 'telefon'. They OUGHT to say 'kõnetraat', for 'speech wire'. The soomlased, by contrast, stay pure, saying 'puhelin', for 'speech wire' or 'speech thread'. - Ancient, pre-war, Estonian play, much imitated in 1960s exile by Mum and Dad: the hero, on the phone, to the heroine, 'Teile räägitakse telefoniga' ('You are being spoken to via telephone', when the hero has to explain, perhaps from Stage Left, something to the Naive-Blonde-Lady heroine, standing at Stage Right); she replies into her handset, in ecstasy, 'Oi, TELEFONIGA', as she realizes that she, too, is participating in technology. So this particular philological mess is old, old, ancient, 1930s or worse. <br><br><br>Hastily, resolutely, <br><br><br>Tom <br><br>(Estonian diaspora, near Toronto in Canada) <br><br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-neglected-technologies.html#c7009160181530604448 title="comment permalink">1/3/16, 7:04 PM</a><br><br>

We may hope that you can later continue discussing the status of Lakeland science. <br><br>If Lakeland has made such a large advance with masers, might it also have some physicists, perhaps working on topics other than masers, in some equivalent of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Studies, or of the Perimeter Institute here in Ontario? The old Soviet model, on which much research was put into Institutes as opposed to universities, MIGHT have something to recommend it in Lakeland. <br><br>Also of conceivable Lakeland interest is the old Soviet approach to high-school education: the State was continually on the prowl for brilliant youngsters, and would put them into several special gymnasia, in half a dozen or so <i>akademgorodoki</i> ("Academic Cities" - i.e., think-tank campuses) across the Union. If you went to such a gymnasium, you would be away from Mum and Dad and siblings for literally months at a time, literally breathing the air of Nobel laureates, and with your future mapped out for you. This, I would suggest, is Heaven on Earth. <br><br>Interestingly, the Union did pay a proper regard for USA achievements, with Feynman's multi-volume physics lectures readily available in Russian, to young book buyers even in remote places east of the Urals. <br><br>With the Union now kaputnik, many of those former brilliant young people have emigrated. I understand that Russia's loss has become in many instances America's gain, as the post-Gorbachev brain-drain plays out.<br><br>In the corner of the Union which was occupied Estonia (the 'Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic', with the unwanted red bedsheet on every flagpole, to universal derision), things were not quite so good in secondary education. **BUT** the ESSR still had a computer - a vast, hot-running, late-1950s vacuum-tube 'URAL' - in the Nõo gymnasium by around 1965, and this was the first in any Union gymnasium. I am pretty sure that Nõo inherited it from Tartu University, when the university undertook a system replacement, going from first-generation mainframe to second-generation mainframe. <br><br>These days, Nõo apparently remains as one of the three Estonian gymnasia particularly tasked by the Ministry of Education and Research with encouraging hard science. It is, admittedly, awkward that pupils going to remote and rural Nõo have to stay on overnight, as boarders in a dorm. <br><br>I think your eventual discussions of Lakeland curriculum are awaited in various quarters of the blogosphere. We may hope that some further particulars on Lakeland science emerge at that time, if indeed not earlier. <br><br><br><br>Cheerfully, respectfully, <br><br><br>Tom<br><br><a href=retrotopia-neglected-technologies.html#c6112862496282508422 title="comment permalink">1/3/16, 7:54 PM</a><br><br>

If you want a really good gaeng fak, I know some really nice people in Krabi, Thailand, but if you would like to do it for yourself, take a good yellow Thai curry and replace the potatoes with the richest squash you can get. Big improvement right away. They also add young pumpkin leaves. The Japanese for pumpkin is "kabocha" which derives directly from "Cambodia" quite a while back.

The problem is that inflation is stubbornly staying below the Federal Reserve’s benchmark of 2%. The FED finally quit waiting for it to get there and began the extremely slow and cautious process of raising interest rates back to historic levels last month.<br><br>As far as another commenter’s note (Celt’s Garden) about some venture capital drying up last March or April - that’s when the market started taking seriously the possibility that the FED would start raising interest rates. I’m not at all surprised that it would cause some venture capitalists to look for less speculative investments. Since the market has already priced two more rate increases this year, I don’t see that causing a lot more turbulence. The current rate increase seems to have passed without any noticeable effect.<br><br>The reason I’m pointing this out is that the more serious part of the financial press seems to be quite well aware of many of the upcoming issues, and people seem to be making long term adjustments.

And how does that rhyme with availability from different sources? I think that is part of what is behind current development of "windmill style" tide power. It is intermittent but predictable. The issues of energy storage are perhaps nicely illustrated by the electric car industry. What is the cost of electricity versus the cost of wear and tear on the battery? I could imagine compressed air energy storage (CAES) may beat that. There are two large scale plants in operation (McIntosh and Huntorf). I believe they would be interesting for the other options they allow in terms of rounding off the tech suite. Perhaps more so than another battery formulation. <br>One more word on the tide power - I think this is a "trick rich" technology and I have some hope that with a few decades of tinkering something can be designed that is viable also in significantly scarcer times than the large wind power plants. Reasons being: energy density in water is higher so you need less gigantic structures. Also the logistics may be more manageable in the long term. Critical issues are of course noise and corrosion/fouling. <br>@GHung: I recommend sd-cards in addition to dvd. I really don't trust digital optical drives to last long where you'd want to read these books. Sd-cards also need refreshing, but at least they store better and there are far fewer moving parts involved. <br>Re drones: Drones are very much a product of the "economics by different means paradigm". With the caveat that we are currently awash in electronics, so you can save a lot of money by not training a pilot, and designing for short lifetime from the get go. They are quite flimsy but aerodynamically efficient. I am not sure regular .50 cal would generate enough spalling to bring one down without hitting critical systems or at just the right angle. And to hit those your markswomen should better use the right support (bipod at least). Last bit - you may want to mention the distinct sound that most small grain canister shot makes.<br>In general I would expect quite a few people training war animals at the proof-of-concept range. I saw a bunch of seagulls going after a small drone on the beach this weekend. I doubt these things would be reliable by 65, but domestication of other (war)animals than the current staple strikes me as one key technology(?)which may hold quite some potential yet. <br>By the way ground ECM is currently routinely used for anything above a walk in the park. It uses some power though and does not seem to be terribly reliable.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-neglected-technologies.html#c965711518621999902 title="comment permalink">1/4/16, 1:29 PM</a><br><br>

They aren't integrated into the force structure for anything but harassing poor people at the moment. <br>Consider a near peer conflict, securing landing zones and drop zones, urban operations, policing, arty spotting, probing, feints and ruses. I don't think helis (or transport gliders) will travel without drones much longer. <br>Of course they'll have to adapt to their mission much better than now - and probably also be intermodal. But speaking as the Atlantic Republic, unless you have penal battalions to burn, why would you not use a drone (or rather 3 of which 2 are dummies) as fast and cheap recon unit - until your subsidized economy dictates otherwise of course. Also once you went through a near peer conflict I assume drones are pretty much what is left (or rather rebuilt) of your air force. <br>I wonder, does any armed force still use (functional) body armor?

A lot of them have to do with starting mechanisms for large internal combustion engines. The engine has an attached pump which tops off the compressed air in a tank whenever the engine is running. That air is then used to power a compressed air starting motor when needed. It has various advantages over an electric starting motor/alternator/battery system, but one drawback is weight, especially of the storage tank which has to hold high pressure (think scuba tanks). This is no problem in stationary systems or large ship systems. <br>As will all systems, the energy losses in both the pump and the air motor have to be factored in; you can never save and use all that original energy you generated say in a windmill or other intermittent source.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-neglected-technologies.html#c3893209786149182076 title="comment permalink">1/4/16, 3:23 PM</a><br><br>

As far as After Progress, it's based on the posts here (I think of this blog as an old-fashioned serial), so if you've read all the posts, you're up on things, but it's always worthwhile to buy the books and have hard copy!<br>As for "self-described 'conservative'", I'm not necessarily a "self-described 'conservative'". I pretty much subscribe to JMG's view that both "sides" (pseudo conservative vs faux left) are intellectually bankrupt and have nothing to offer. The Suicide of the American Left and the post about pseudo conservative Satanism pretty much sums it up. As a disillusioned Democrat, I'm probably more small-c, Burkean (of who I need to read). Right now, I'm reading I'll Take My Stand, and enjoying it thoroughly! I wish the South could be refashioned (restored) in its image, and set aside the whole financial/industrial experiment as a bad nightmare!<br><br><a href=retrotopia-neglected-technologies.html#c5902362058552899110 title="comment permalink">1/5/16, 7:13 PM</a><br><br>

It saw the rise of rock'n'roll, but was before the days of the incessant and intrusive soundtracks that accompany all aspects of life today. Then I remembered something called the Wall of Sound - an invention that came out of rock'n'roll and was widely greeted with great praise, and started to wonder why.<br><br>Now, I hate the incessant soundtracks, and movie soundtracks that drown out the dialog, and "wall of sound" music feels like the tortures of hell to me. So why was it so avidly welcomed, and why do people like it today and even insist on it? <br><br>I applied Miller's Law: assume it's true, and figure what it could be true of. A comment by an Ayn Rand character - she DID have her moments! - came to mind. "Don't bother to examine a folly. Just ask what it accomplishes." And that one was easy. "I can't hear myself think."<br><br>Today's blasts of sound from every amplifier on the planet is designed to keep people from thinking, and they welcomed it because it did drown out their thoughts. That's the only answer I can come up with. For what it's worth.<br><br>Now, Lakeland obviously does not have that. Does the Atlantic Republic? Or did that vanish in the Troubles of our own day? There is no sign that Peter Carr misses the noise, for what that's worth. But, it;s a thought. <br><br>P.S. Now rereading COLLAPSE NOW AND AVOID THE RUSH.

I haven't been so riveted to the page/screen since your series on the Civil Religion of Progress. <br><br>I wonder what your Archdruidical intuitions say regarding Trump's magical abilities; he seems to work a quite respectable spell. As you pointed out, media figures generally set out to deride him but tend uncannily often instead to play into his hands (if not eat out of them). I believe he said he has barely had to spend on advertisements, due to the immense free publicity this provides. <br><br>Regarding the "salary class"--it may have fared better than the wage class so far, but even supposedly elite professionals are now feeling a squeeze. I know many people with PhDs, and hours are becoming extreme, competition more rapacious, and the hiring system itself dominated by sudden layoffs and favoritism. Gluts of professional degrees like PhDs and J.D.'s have driven starting salaries down and led to big pools of un(der)employed people with advanced degrees. In medicine, administrative and profit-seeking pressures are creating widespread misery--do not ask a doctor about whether to go to med school today unless you have a stiff drink handy. Collapse may have begun with the wage class, but it appears to be well afoot elsewhere too.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-neglected-technologies.html#c4650050607288039083 title="comment permalink">1/20/16, 8:00 PM</a><br><br>

No species has a fitness that can be valued in an isolated way. The fitness of any species is determined by its ability to derive energy to live from the ecosystem it lives in and the ability not to get eaten by predators, parasites or other organisms that choose the considered species as a source of energy. <br><br>Similiar, no technology has an intrinsic value, but technology has always to be judged by the ecosystem it lives in. Technological items have to be developed, produces, maintained, supplied with flows of energy and or material or information to work with and of course technology needs able people to create and use it. All those things have to be provided be the ecosystem the technology lives in. For example in today's ecosystem, every room in every building is connected to the electric grid. Thus any household appliance that uses electricity can easily create advantages. In medieval times, every farmer was able to do basic woodcraft, so every technology that was based on woodwork (tools, buildings, ...) could be easily maintained by the farmer himself. <br><br>My thoughts about retrotopia are, that you basically moved a past ecosystem into the future. As intriguing as the idea of a less complex future is (and i agree totally with you an that) i think the future will in no way resemble the past, because technological evolution, like biological evolution, can not run backwards. There will never be dinosaurs again, because the ecosystem they evolved in is gone forever, and no future technological ecosystem will be the same as past ones. <br><br>I see some current technologies that will survive a long time, because they are very powerful. One are electrical engines. Electrical motors and generators are extremely simple devices of wrapped copper wires. Every 18th century instrument builder could have made them, if they were known to them. Yet they show efficiencies of above 90% and have almost no mechanical wear. Another thing that will be around for some time is the ecosystem needed to create military missiles. Even tiny isolated North Korea managed to build them, and their military value is unmatched. Same is true for a wide range of sensors based on different EM-waves.<br>Today computational power is roughly 250 Million times cheaper then in the 80s. So when the fossil fuel subsidies for electronics vanish and their cost would even rise by a factor of some hundred millions due to that, we could still maintain the level of automation we had in the 80s. <br><br>So i agree that a future technological ecosystem will be much less complex then the current one, but i think that we will not go back to the mechanical age, but instead fall back to a less complex electronical age. I can even imagine, that in analogy the the blacksmith, who maintained the technologies around iron even for the most remote villages in darkest medieval times, future darker ages may have in small towns a craftsman for electrical and electronical devices, keeping alive pumps, generators, lamps and the sensors and communications for the towns defence.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-neglected-technologies.html#c114893749498580387 title="comment permalink">4/26/16, 1:43 AM</a><br><br>
