According to an assortment of recent news stories, this Thursday, June 18, is the make-or-break date by which a compromise has to be reached between Greece and the EU if a Greek default, with the ensuing risk of a potential Greek exit from the Eurozone, is to be avoided. If that’s more than just media hype, there’s a tremendous historical irony in the fact.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>June 18 is after all the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo, where a previous attempt at European political and economic integration came to grief. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course there are plenty of differences between the two events. In 1815 the preferred instrument of integration was raw military force; in 2015, for a variety of reasons, a variety of less overt forms of political and economic pressure have taken the place of Napoleon’s Grande Arm<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"'>é</span>e. The events of 1815 were also much further along the curve of defeat than those of 2015.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Waterloo was the end of the road for France’s dream of pan-European empire, while the current struggles over the Greek debt are taking place at a noticeably earlier milepost along the same road. The faceless EU bureaucrats who are filling Napoleon’s role this time around thus won’t be on their way to Elba for some time yet. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“What discords will drive Europe into that artificial unity—only dry or drying sticks can be tied into a bundle—which is the decadence of every civilization?” William Butler Yeats wrote that in 1936. It was a poignant question but also a highly relevant one, since the discords in question were moving rapidly toward explosion as he penned the last pages of
<i>A Vision</i>, where those words appear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Like most of those who see history in cyclical terms, Yeats recognized that the patterns that recur from age to age<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>are trends and motifs rather than exact narratives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The part played by a conqueror in one era can end up in the hands of a heroic failure in the next, for circumstances can define a historical role but not the irreducibly human strengths and foibles of the person who happens to fill it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus it’s not too hard to look at the rising spiral of stresses in the European Union just now and foresee the eventual descent of the continent into a mix of domestic insurgency and authoritarian nationalism, with the oncoming tide of mass migration from Africa and the Middle East adding further pressure to an already explosive mix. Exactly how that will play out over the next century, though, is a very tough question to answer. A century from now, due to raw demography, many countries in Europe will be majority-Muslim nations that look to Mecca for the roots of their faith and culture—but which ones, and how brutal or otherwise will the transition be? That’s impossible to know in advance. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are plenty of similar examples just now; for the student of historical cycles, 2015 practically defines the phrase “target-rich environment.” Still, I want to focus on something a little different here. Partly, this is because the example I have in mind makes a good opportunity to point out the the way that what philosophers call the contingent nature of events—in less highflown language, the sheer cussedness of things—keeps history’s dice constantly rolling. Partly, though, it’s because this particular example is likely to have a substantial impact on the future of everyone reading this blog. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Last year saw a great deal of talk in the media about possible parallels between the current international situation and that of the world precisely a century ago, in the weeks leading up to the outbreak of the First World War.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Mind you, <a href=../../2014/07/in-handful-of-dust.html>since I contributed to that discussion</a>, I’m hardly in a position to reject the parallels out of hand. Still, the more I’ve observed the current situation, the more I’ve come to think that a different date makes a considerably better match to present conditions. To be precise, instead of a replay of 1914, I think we’re about to see an equivalent of 1939—but not quite the 1939 we know. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Two entirely contingent factors, added to all the other pressures driving toward that conflict, made the Second World War what it was. The first, of course, was the personality of Adolf Hitler. It was probably a safe bet that somebody in Weimar Germany would figure out how to build a bridge between the politically active but fragmented nationalist Right and the massive but politically inert German middle classes, restore Germany to great-power status, and gear up for a second attempt to elbow aside the British Empire. That the man who happened to do these things was an eccentric anti-Semite ideologue who combined shrewd political instincts, utter military incompetence, and a frankly psychotic faith in his own supposed infallibility, though, was in no way required by the logic of history. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Had Corporal Hitler taken an extra lungful of gas on the Western Front, someone else would likely have filled the same role in the politics of the time. We don’t even have to consider what might have happened if the nation that birthed Frederick the Great and Otto von Bismarck had come up with a third statesman of the same caliber. If the German head of state in 1939 had been merely a capable pragmatist with adequate government and military experience, and guided Germany’s actions by a logic less topsy-turvy than Hitler’s, the trajectory of those years would have been far different.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The second contingent factor that defined the outcome of the great wars of the twentieth century is broader in focus than the quirks of a single personality, but it was just as subject to those vagaries that make hash out of attempts at precise historical prediction. As discussed in an earlier post on this blog, <a href=../../2012/04/america-eagle-and-lion.html>it was by no means certain that America would be Britain’s ally</a> when war finally came. From the Revolution onward, Britain was in many Americans’ eyes the national enemy; as late as the 1930s, when the US Army held its summer exercises, the standard scenario involved a British invasion of US territory. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All along, there was an Anglophile party in American cultural life, and its ascendancy in the years after 1900 played a major role in bringing the United States into two world wars on Britain’s side. Still, there was a considerably more important factor in play, which was a systematic British policy of conciliating the United States. From the American Civil War on, Britain allowed the United States liberties it would never have given any other power,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When the United States expanded its influence in Latin America and the Carribbean, Britain allowed itself to be upstaged there; when the United States shook off its<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>isolationism and built a massive blue-water navy, the British even allowed US naval vessels to refuel at British coaling stations during the global voyage of the “Great White Fleet” in 1907-9. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This was partly a reflection of the common cultural heritage that made many British politicians think of the United States as a sort of boisterous younger brother of theirs, and partly a cold-eyed recognition, in the wake of the Civil War, that war between Britain and the United States would almost certainly lead to a US invasion of Canada that Britain was very poorly positioned to counter. Still, there was another issue of major importance. To an extent few people realized at the time, the architecture of European peace after Waterloo depended on political arrangements that kept the German-speaking lands of the European core splintered into a diffuse cloud of statelets too small to threaten any of the major powers.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The great geopolitical fact of the 1860s was the collapse of that cloud into the nation of Germany, under the leadership of the dour northeastern kingdom of Prussia. In 1866, the Prussians pounded the stuffing out of Austria and brought the rest of the German states into a federation; in 1870-1871, the Prussians and their allies did the same thing to France, which was a considerably tougher proposition—this was the same French nation, remember, which brought Europe to its knees in Napoleon’s day—and the federation became the German Empire. The Austro-Hungarian Empire was widely considered the third great power in Europe until 1866; until 1870, France was the second; everybody knew that sooner or later the Germans were going to take on great power number one. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
British policy toward the United States from 1871 onward was thus tempered by the harsh awareness that Britain could not afford to alienate a rising power who might become an ally, or at least a friendly neutral, when the inevitable war with Germany arrived. Above all, an alliance between Germany and the United States would have been Britain’s death warrant, and everyone in the Foreign Office and the Admiralty in London had to know that. The thought of German submarines operating out of US ports, German and American fleets combining to take on the Royal Navy, and American armies surging into Canada and depriving Britain of a critical source of raw materials and recruits while the British Army was pinned down elsewhere, must have given British planners many sleepless nights. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
After 1918, that recognition must have been even more sharply pointed, because US loans and munitions shipments played a massive role in saving the western Allies from collapse in the face of the final German offensive in the autumn of 1917, and turned the tide in a war that, until then, had largely gone Germany’s way. During the two decades leading up to 1939, as Germany recovered and rearmed, British governments did everything they could to keep the United States on their side, with results that paid off handsomely when the Second World War finally came. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s imagine, though, an alternative timeline in which the Foreign Office and the Admiralty from 1918 on are staffed by idiots. Let’s further imagine that Parliament is packed with clueless ideologues whose sole conception of foreign policy is that everyone, everywhere, ought to be bludgeoned into compliance with Britain’s edicts, no matter how moronic those happen to be. Let’s say, in particular, that one British government after another conducts its policy toward the United States on the basis of smug self-centered arrogance, and any move the US makes to assert itself on the international stage can count on an angry response from London. The United States launches an aircraft carrier? A threat to world peace, the London <i>Times</i>
roars.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The United States exerts diplomatic pressure on Mexico, and builds military bases in Panama? British diplomats head for the Carribbean and Latin America to stir up as much opposition to America’s agenda as possible. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s say, furthermore, that in this alternative timeline, Adolf Hitler did indeed take one too many deep breaths on the Western Front, and lies in a military cemetery, one more forgotten casualty of the Great War. In his absence, the German Workers Party remains a fringe group, and the alliance between the nationalist Right and the middle classes is built instead by the Deutsche Volksfreiheitspartei (DVFP), which seizes power in 1934. Ulrich von Hassenstein, the new Chancellor, is a competent insider who knows how to listen to his diplomats and General Staff, and German foreign and military policy under his leadership pursues the goal of restoring Germany to world-power status using considerably less erratic means than those used by von Hassenstein’s equivalent in our timeline. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Come 1939, finally, as rising tensions between Germany and the Anglo-French alliance over Poland’s status move toward war, Chancellor von Hassenstein welcomes US President Charles Lindbergh to Berlin, where the two heads of state sign a galaxy of treaties and trade agreements and talk earnestly to the media about the need to establish a multipolar world order to replace Britain’s global hegemony. A second world war is in the offing, but the shape of that war will be very different from the one that broke out in our version of 1939, and while the United States almost certainly will be among the victors, Britain almost certainly will not. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Does all this sound absurd? Let’s change the names around and see. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Just as the great rivalry of the first half of the twentieth century was fought out between Britain and Germany, the great rivalry of the century’s second half was between the United States and Russia. If nuclear weapons hadn’t been invented, it’s probably a safe bet that at some point the rivalry would have ended in another global war.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>As it was, the threat of mutual assured destruction meant that the struggle for global power had to be fought out less directly, in a flurry of proxy wars, sponsored insurgencies, economic warfare, subversion, sabotage, and bare-knuckle diplomacy. In that war, the United States came out on top, and Soviet Russia went the way of Imperial Germany, plunging into the same sort of political and economic chaos that beset the Weimar Republic in its day. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The supreme strategic imperative of the United States in that war was finding ways to drive as deep a wedge as possible between Russia and China, in order to keep them from taking concerted action against the US. That wasn’t all that difficult a task, since the two nations have very little in common and many conflicting interests. Nixon’s 1972 trip to China was arguably the defining moment in the Cold War, the point at which China’s separation from the Soviet bloc became total and Chinese integration with the American economic order began. From that point on, for Russia, it was basically all downhill. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the aftermath of Russia’s defeat,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>the same strategic imperative remained, but the conditions of the post-Cold War world made it almost absurdly easy to carry out. All that would have been needed were American policies that gave Russia and China meaningful, concrete reasons to think that their national interests and aspirations would be easier to achieve in cooperation with a US-led global order than in opposition to it. Granting Russia and China the same position of regional influence that the US accords to Germany and Japan as a matter of course probably would have been enough. A little forbearance, a little foreign aid, a little adroit diplomacy, and the United States would have been in the catbird’s seat, with Russia and China glaring suspiciously at each other across their long and problematic mutual border, and bidding against each other for US support in their various disagreements. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
But that’s not what happened, of course. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What happened instead was that the US embraced a foreign policy so astonishingly stupid that I’m honestly not sure the English language has adequate resources to describe it. Since 1990, one US administration after another, with the enthusiastic bipartisan support of Congress and the capable assistance of bureaucrats across official Washington from the Pentagon and the State Department on down, has pursued policies guaranteed to force Russia and China to set aside their serious mutual differences and make common cause against us. Every time the US faced a choice between competing policies, it’s consistently chosen the option most likely to convince Russia, China, or both nations at once that they had nothing to gain from further cooperation with American agendas. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What’s more, the US has more recently managed the really quite impressive feat of bringing Iran into rapprochement with the emerging Russo-Chinese alliance. It’s hard to think of another nation on Earth that has fewer grounds for constructive engagement with Russia or China than the Islamic Republic of Iran, but several decades of cluelessly hamfisted American blundering and bullying finally did the job. My American readers can now take pride in the state-of-the-art Russian air defense systems around Tehran, the bustling highways carrying Russian and Iranian products to each other’s markets, and the Russian and Chinese intelligence officers who are doubtless settling into comfortable digs on the north shore of the Persian Gulf, where they can snoop on the daisy chain of US bases along the south shore. After all, a quarter century of US foreign policy made those things happen. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s one thing to engage in this kind of serene disregard for reality when you’ve got the political unity, the economic abundance, and the military superiority to back it up. The United States today, like the British Empire in 1939, no longer has those. We’ve got an impressive fleet of aircraft carriers, sure, but Britain had an equally impressive fleet of battleships in 1939, and you’ll notice how much good those did them. Like Britain in 1939, the United States today is perfectly prepared for a kind of war that nobody fights any more, while rival nations less constrained by the psychology of previous investment and less riddled with institutionalized graft are fielding novel weapons systems designed to do end runs around our strengths and focus with surgical precision on our weaknesses.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meanwhile, inside the baroque carapace of carriers, drones, and all the other high-tech claptrap of an obsolete way of war, the United States is a society in freefall, far worse off than Britain was during its comparatively mild 1930s downturn. Its leaders have forfeited the respect of a growing majority of its citizens; its economy has morphed into a Potemkin-village capitalism in which the manipulation of unpayable IOUs in absurd and rising amounts has all but replaced the actual production of goods and services; its infrastructure is so far fallen into decay that many US counties no longer pave their roads; most Americans these days think of their country’s political institutions as the enemy and its loudly proclaimed ideals as some kind of sick joke—and in both cases, not without reason. The national unity that made victory in two world wars and the Cold War possible went by the boards a long time ago, drowned in a tub by Tea Party conservatives who thought they were getting rid of government and limousine liberals who were going through the motions of sticking it to the Man. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I could go on tracing parallels for some time—in particular, despite a common rhetorical trope of US Russophobes, Vladimir Putin is not an Adolf Hitler but a fair equivalent of the Ulrich von Hassenstein of my alternate-history narrative—but here again, my readers can do the math themselves. The point I want to make is that all the signs suggest we are entering an era of international conflict in which the United States has thrown away nearly all its potential strengths, and handed its enemies advantages they would never have had if our leaders had the brains the gods gave geese. Since nuclear weapons still foreclose the option of major wars between the great powers, the conflict in question will doubtless be fought using the same indirect methods as the Cold War; in fact, it’s already being fought by those means, as the victims of proxy wars in Ukraine, Syria, and Yemen already know. The question in my mind is simply how soon those same methods get applied on American soil. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We thus stand at the beginning of a long, brutal epoch, as unforgiving as the one that dawned in 1939. Those who pin Utopian hopes on the end of American hegemony will get to add disappointment to that already bitter mix, since hegemony remains the same no matter who happens to be perched temporarily in the saddle. (I also wonder how many of the people who think they’ll rejoice at the end of American hegemony have thought through the impact on their hopes of collective betterment, not to mention their own lifestyles, once the 5% of the world’s population who live in the US can no longer claim a quarter or so of the world’s resources and wealth.) If there’s any hope possible at such a time, to my mind, it’s the one W.H. Auden proposed as the conclusion of his bleak and brilliant poem “September 1, 1939”: </div>

Even the ones that are seemingly worldly and educated have a badly outdated and simplistic view of Russia, China and their potential cooperation. They think of Russia as a crude collapsed country with outdated technology and China as a large but compliant vendor who only wants to please it's biggest ( in thier mind) market and sell us more stuff. The idea that the two countries could get together against us is considered absurd, and they think I have been brainwashed by RT when I describe the theoretical effectiveness of Chinese and Russian missile technology. My only hope is that a large scale proxy war will be avoided because that nuts and bolts generals in the Pentagon know the real score ( in spite of clueless leadership) and will throw an wrench in the works. But that of course has not stopped stupid politicians in the past and it may not in the future. Or perhaps Russia and China will be satisfied by sinking the petrodollar and then dumping all their U.S. treasury bonds on the market all at once, which may effectively destroy the empire, but at least with less bloodshed.<br><br><a href=#c2311531604329660278 title="comment permalink">6/17/15, 5:55 PM</a><br><br>

As for the possibility of missing the iceberg, it's rather late for that, because it's not just the elites who have bought into a delusional worldview. Most ordinary Americans would angrily refuse to accept the limits on the nation's global power and their own personal lifestyles that any meaningful evasive maneuver would require.

An alliance between China and Russia may well be what's needed to bring down the American Empire...but what about other minor players? Wouldn't the support or opposition of the EU, Japan, Brazil or India possibly tip the scales to either side's favor?

They look at the size of our forces and our military budget, which is as large as all other countries combined, and just laugh at the possibility. Of course, if the next conflict is one that we're not prepared for, then it doesn't matter how many weapons and troops we have. For example, if foreign powers try to abet domestic conflict and foment chaos, then all those weapons won't do any good.<br><br>That's already started. I mentioned the data breach blamed on the Chinese last week. That's just intelligence gathering.

One difficulty is that parts of the EU gained their economic dominance of much of the south through loans and the provision of goods. If Greece backs away from the EU, the loans may well have to be written off (there is a strong argument to say that that should happen anyway) and they will also lose access to markets for their goods. It is certainly a lose - lose situation and there is no upside at all. There is an element of responsibility on the part of irresponsible lenders when loans are defaulted upon - just sayin... Many pension and hedge funds will feel the bite from this one – eventually anyway.<br><br>That concept is hysterical: "staffed by idiots" and "packed with clueless ideologues"! Very, very, funny, except that it also reflects the current situation. Not so funny. I had to reach for a chamomile tea before reading the next bit, because the US foreign policy is making serious blunders that the British rather astutely avoided - although that lot did make some other rather serious errors of their own.<br><br>Incidentally, how come we don't hear any more about quantitative easing going on over in the US? It is not as if the fundamentals have been sorted out in the meantime. It has gone very quiet though on that front, especially once debt to GDP ratio's appear to have pushed past the 100% mark. There does seem to be some hypothetical talk of official interest rate rises which I don’t take very seriously as that would add to the burden of servicing the debt. It hasn’t escaped people’s attention that if the cost of borrowing is almost nothing, then borrowing seems to be OK. I noted that I spotted an article recently that stated that whilst Apple was apparently sitting on $200bn in cash reserves they appear to have borrowed funds to pay for the recent dividend to shareholders. Only in 2015 could such craziness appear to happen…<br><br>It is also worth noting that some of the countries mentioned are not shy of combat casualties either and thus are fighting under an entirely different psychology and sense of purpose.<br><br>Now back here, you may not be aware, but we appear to be suffering the same sort of fools - which is mildly unusual and disconcerting as we generally suffer a pragmatic bunch. This choice quote came out of the mouth of the Treasurer this week when prodded about the housing bubble and affordability issues for first home buyers: <a href=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/joe-hockeys-advice-to-first-homebuyers--get-a-good-job-that-pays-good-money-20150609-ghjqyw.html rel=nofollow>get a good job that pays good money</a>. I guess there is a certain sort of ruthless pragmatism inherent in that quote, but underlying that is a tacit acknowledgement that the door has finally closed for much of the population because not everyone can get a good job that pays good money (note that the two aren't one and the same either). Why young people aren't rioting in the streets is generally beyond my understanding - oh that's right they're being pacified with television and toys.<br><br>Oh yeah, I believe the China - Australia free trade agreement was signed this week. Have you noticed that the Trans Pacific Partnership was not signed this week? Some of the things the pharmaceutical industry is lobbying for in that agreement will cost us plenty. Interesting times, I really do have to put some thought towards learning the standard Chinese language...<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br>Oh yeah!

A point you made in Twilight' Last Gleaming is that the Chinese are very likely to know the importance of a light touch. We know this because of pat experience of their hegemony.<br><br>In contrast, the US national character is messianic, and with its foundations in slavery and genocide. It has always solved its social problems by dumping them on the frontier; the extreme social crisis from 1877-1914 was in great measure due to the loss of the escape valve of expansion against the Indians, eventually papered over by its replacement with expansion against the rest of the world. Thus the gaudy imperialisms of McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, and Woodrow Wilson - who came back from France in 1919 announcing that everyone now knew that America is the savior of the world. For a professing Christian to use those words was a remarkably explicit descent into a doctrine of antichrist.<br><br>For the Chinese to recognize their limits is something they've learned over thousands of years.

In Taiwan, the plague is more popular than the prospect of joining the PRC. The last time China (in this case, the Republic of China, not the PRC) took over Taiwan - which was in 1947, when most of the Taiwanese people were happy about joining China because they were expecting it to being an improvement over Japanese rule - things went so badly that, within years, most Taiwanese wished they had remained a part of the Japanese empire. The PRC in the 1950s tried to invade Taiwan by military means - which did nothing to improve the Taiwanese people's feelings about Taiwan. Ever since, China has constantly threatened to invade Taiwan and, seeing the way that the PRC treats Tibetans and Uyghurs and other groups, most Taiwanese believe that a PRC takeover would mean being stripped of their resources and losing most of their civic freedoms. Though Taiwan is often annoyed by the USA, given a choice between China and the USA, the Taiwanese people strongly favor the USA.<br><br>Most of Asia doesn't have as strong an anti-Chinese sentiment as Taiwan, but in my travels, people are consistently most antagonistic towards China than the USA, not because they like the USA, but because they consider China to be the greater evil. Though South Koreans have grievances against the USA, even 'anti-American' South Koreans are more scared of China than the USA (it doesn't help that China consistently supports North Korea). The people I met in Japan seem to be less concerned about China than the South Koreans I met, but I still got the sense that they prefer allying with the USA over China. I've never been to Vietnam, but I read that in recent polls, Vietnamese have more antipathy towards China than the USA - which is amazing considering how much pain the USA historically inflicted on Vietnam.<br><br>There is talk of many of these Asian countries banding together to form an alliance to protect themselves from China - and if enough countries with significant military and/or economic power join together, they probably can be as powerful as China.<br><br>Furthermore, there are outstanding territorial disputes over Arunachal Pradesh between China and India which, in short, discourage India from being friendly with China, without giving China much in return (okay, it may grant China more control over some of the water resources of the Himalayas).<br><br>This is not even considering internal conditions in China. China is facing its own legitimacy crisis, as the legitimacy of the PRC government rests on improving living conditions of ordinary people, and that hasn't been happening recently, between the massive environmental destruction and massive amount of political corruption, standards of living are not rising for ordinary Chinese (and there is a big stock market bubble which is at the stage where many ordinary Chinese people are buying stocks because bank accounts yield negative interest rates).<br><br>None of this is to say that American foreign policy has been good. My point is that China's foreign policy, at least with regard to its Asian neighbors, has not been winning it many allies.<br><br><a href=#c1131745256281414162 title="comment permalink">6/17/15, 7:22 PM</a><br><br>

As you suggest , like drones , they mindlessley implement deeply flawed and redundant ideologies , their most cherished aim being a certain type of "certainty " , where they can predict some type of outcome that they know they can "manage " , rather than blazing authentic and promising trails which lead off in certain intuitive directions , albeit with unknown outcomes . Above all , the system professes to be "risk averse " , which tends inevitably to stir up the quantum probablilities of "riskiness " . The espousing of "aggression " which is the mantra of every corporate leader these days also amounts to anything but .<br>Ego versus Will , both individual and collective .<br>Hitler himself bears some interesting comparisons to this ego driven system of governance , as the following insightful assessment on his old boss by no less than Field Marshall Erich von Manstein bears out - "Hitler as Supreme Commander "-. Have we collectively and individually , ( and cyclically as a species ) all become little Freudian Adolf Dictator Pygmies ? <br>" The Will , as he saw it , had only to be translated into faith down to the youngest private for the correctness of his decisions to be confirmed and the success if his orders ensured ....The will for victory which gives a commander the strength to see a grave crisis through is something very different from Hitlers will , which in the last analysis stemmed from a belief in his own "mission". Such a belief inevitably makes a man impervious to reason and leads him to think that his own will can operate even beyond the limits of hard reality .....Generally speaking , Hitler had little inclination to relate his own calculations to the probable intentions of the enemy , since he was convinced that his will would always triumph in the end . Hitler was disinclined to accept reports of enemy superiority out of hand or minimised them with assertions about the enemies deficiencies and took refuge in endless recitations of German production figures . In the face of his will , the essential elements of of the appreciation of a situation on which every commanders decision must based were virtually eliminated , and with that Hitler turned his back on reality .

The same man who after his successes in politics up to 1938 had become a political gambler , actually recoiled from risks in the military field . During the Russian campaign Hitlers fear of risk manifested itself in two ways . One - his refusal to accept that elasticity of operations which could only be achieved by a voluntary if temporary surrender of conquered territory . The second was his reluctance to denude secondary fronts in favour of the spot where the main decision had to fall. There are three possible reasons why Hitler evaded this risks ..First , he may have secretly felt he lacked the military ability to cope with them ; this being so , he was even less likely to credit his generals with having it . Two , the fear common to all dictators that any setback would lead to a loss of prestige , a practice bound to lead the man to military mistakes which damage prestige more than ever . Three , Hitlers intense dislike , rooted in his lust for power , of giving up anything on which he had once laid hands . <br>Whenever he was confronted with a decision which he did not like taking but could not ultimately evade , Hitler would procrastinate for as long as he possibly could ....The General Staff had to struggle with Hitler for days to get forces released to deal with crisis , usually too small a number too late , with the result that he usually had to commit several times what was originally required . ....His inflated belief in his own will power , a certain aversion to accepting risk when success could not be guaranteed in advance and his dislike for giving up anything voluntarily were the hallmarks of his military leadership .

So long as they continue to get the same sort of benefits they've received so far, they're likely to stay neutral -- which is precisely what would benefit the Russo-Chinese side most. <br><br>John, for the moment, that's about all any of us can do. <br><br>Pinku-Sensei, as far as I know, the DVFP is my own invention, and so is Ulrich von Hassenstein -- I figured that was probably better under the circumstances than trying to fit a historical figure into the necessary mode. As for Russia and China, of course the Chinese are the dominant partner -- and that's one of the reasons it would have been so easy to keep Russia out of that alliance. Playing second fiddle to China, though, is considerably more attractive to Moscow than being handed a kazoo by the US and being told to pay for the privilege of playing it. <br><br>Peakfuture, one does indeed wonder. <br><br>Cherokee, quantitative easing is still going full tilt over here; it's just become old news. I'm not sure whether this is still the case, but for a while there the Fed was manufacturing enough money each month to buy up the treasury bills sold that month, thus enabling the US government to go its merry way spending trillions of dollars it doesn't have. Do pick up a good Chinese phrase book, so you can sell fresh vegetables to Australia's new overlords...<br><br>Peter, you might consider talking to people from Tibet, and checking out the condition of China's ecosystems, before you dig yourself any deeper. Hegemony is hegemony. <br><br>Notes, that's one more parallel with the US in 1939; we had the same kind of bullying attitude toward our neighbors in those years, too. China's bad relations with its immediate neighbors is one of the reasons the Russian alliance, and similar though less critical partnerings with Pakistan and certain other countries, are so important to Beijing just now. <br><br>Doctor W., well, yes -- in the years immediately after the fall of the Soviet Union, the US treated Russia as a conquered province. I've heard plenty of similar stories. <br><br>HalFiore, no, that's just it. The logic of history didn't require the US to behave so stupidly.

With Russia bristling every time China encroached on Japanese sea lanes, and China bristling every time the Russians overflew the East China Sea, it would have been possible to keep the two rival nations so wrapped up in fist-pounding and angry diatribes that neither one would have had time to hassle the United States.

As Notes pointed out earlier, a lot of China's neighboring countries are constantly bickering with China about territory. Last year, Russia acknowledged that China has been assisting nature in changing the course of rivers which mark boundaries between the two countries in order to gain more of Russia's land. As was noted in the Strats article, China has a country deeply divided between have and have-not. The resources Russia has are greatly coveted by the Chinese, and China historically feels rightful ownership of much of the Russian Far East. <br><br>In my wife's reading of a man whom I would consider the Russian equivalent of JMG, for his historic insights of the future and deeply spiritual reverence of the natural world, by the name of Vadim Zeland, he suggests that Russia is being played as a pawn and fitting in exactly where the USA wants them, even taking a quote from Obama saying he "is not concerned with the situation" to imply that Russia is exactly where the US wants them. <br><br>Yes, US power is waning, and China is a great player in the up-and-coming battle of supremacy, but I think despite much of the ineptitude of US leadership, there still may be a transfer of power more the equivalent of UK to USA waiting ahead of us, or that something else is waiting out in the gray areas and thus will come in quite unexpectedly.<br><br><a href=#c333716557373649665 title="comment permalink">6/17/15, 11:29 PM</a><br><br>

I keep a wary eye on the bigger picture, but have stopped consuming the news, because its only purpose seems to be to make me worry. Instead, I read very widely and study human nature because it is so fascinating. And it seems to me that the people who are most happy and most free are those who don't have a stake in the status quo. Living quietly outside of mainstream society means neatly sidestepping a mountain of issues that lock people in to clinging to a way of life that is ridiculous, makes them unhappy and keeps them at an infantile level of dependence.<br><br>Diogenes was eating lentils for dinner when wealthy Aristippus strolled by and told him, "If you would only be subservient to the king, you would not have to eat lentils for dinner."<br><br>And Diogenes retorted, "If I eat lentils for dinner I do not have to be subservient to the king."<br><br>I am not very far down this track, but my life is headed only in the direction of lentils for dinner, and out from under the weight of subservience to the king. <br><br>Fear of the future does not get us very far down the track of living a splendid, subservience-free life.

And in the face of the uncertain future that we are dished up week after week here on ADR it is tempting to scramble to find a way to preserve all of it.. when really, the way to freedom is to step away from the cocoon, and work out how to live with the immense courage and resourcefulness that everyone else has always had to..<br><br>There is a wonderful Maori proverb - "He who climbs a cliff, may die on the cliff.

The stupidity displayed brings to my mind three possibilities, and I honestly can't decide which is true:<br><br>1. There are people in our government who, for whatever reason, want us to decline, for reasons benign or malicious;<br>2. The top brass are aware of a great deal more regarding Russia/China/etc. than they have let on, and we've properly concluded they're our enemies but can't disclose this for some strategic purpose;<br>3. They are just THAT stupid.<br><br>Obviously history argues for the third. Those who really, really hate Obama (or the previous/next figurehead) favor the first. I can honestly see the second being true, namely that at some point during or after the soviet collapse, Russia and China made common cause against us and we have become aware of it. But like cracking Enigma, we let bad things happen because we can't let them know we know, perhaps? I'm grasping at straws, of course. It's just hard to believe they are this stupid. Conspiracy can always provide a mental escape hatch, after all.<br><br>So proxy war is in our future, and this time our allies will be largely on the defensive. Russia and China are smart and will not fully play their hand until it is necessary to do so, and will use every form of carrot to lure those who don't require the stick. Thus anyone who can be won over will be. They promise Brazil and India equal footing and massive trade while providing the only viable financial system after ours falls, and they'll be on board. They promise to give half of the Middle East to the Caliphate (after Assad's fall) and the other half to Iran, and they're golden there. China has already courted Africa across the board. The proxy wars will only take place in the locations where it is both feasible and where it weakens us strategically, so Japan isn't doable (too homogeneous and unified politically).<br><br>So, uh, sorry about this then, Europe. Looks like you're the new SE Asia. Fomenting conflict in the US is possible, but any direct effort would be foolhardy. Simply collapse the economy in a coordinated effort (with plausible deniability due to external events, of course) and we'll be at each others' throats in short order. And if this collapses the Chinese and Russian economies as well, all the more reason for overt war. Taiwan, Ukraine, Georgia, perhaps parts of Japan, maybe even Poland all are prime targets. Heck, pressure on Australia might even go too far.<br><br>Europe in chaos, the US economy in ashes followed by civil war, the marching millions in eastern Europe and SE Asia, a dissolved EU, a solidified BRIC economic alliance... It's going to be very, very ugly. How will the US government handle all this? I can't see any response other than belligerence and bloodshed. They will not go quietly into that evil night. At which point, twelve well-aimed missiles (or sabatuers) can destroy our carrier groups and shut down the US grid.<br><br>What do you think, JMG? This sound like the most likely scenario to you?<br><br><a href=#c3078724894598107909 title="comment permalink">6/18/15, 12:15 AM</a><br><br>

Spain and Portugal joined the EU only after they had become democratic.<br><br>Mr Greer:<br><br>Governments do stupid things, yet the people who take those decisions are not stupid. Think of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The Japanese knew that the USA had ten times Japan's industrial capacity, and could therefore produce ten times more aircraft, ships, tanks, etc. They also knew that the USA had four times their population, and could therefore send four times more soldiers to the battlefield. And yet, Japan attacked the USA. Why? Because they were throttled by an oil embargo, and in the Samurai ideology, which the Japanese ruling class still adhered to, surrendering without fighting was simply unthinkable, because losing one's honor was worse than losing one's life. Even high IQ people can adhere to quasi-mystic beliefs.<br><br>In 1997, Zbigniew Brzezinski published a book in which he explained why it was in the USA's interest to prevent a Russia-China alliance at any cost. The book, "The Grand Chessboard", was an international best-seller and can be downloaded for free on the Internet. In spite of Brzezinski's notoriety and brilliancy, US policy, including the recent sanctions against Russia, has taken the suicidal course of pushing Russia, China and Iran into each other's arms. But I think that there are logical reasons for this.<br><br>To make a long story short: American leaders (Bill Clinton among them) didn't make geostrategic issues like preventing a Russia-China alliance high enough on their agenda. It was (and still is) more politically interesting for them to score domestic political points by putting Russia down. Putting Russia down, if it had succeeded, would have enabled US oil companies to control Russian hydrocarbons. Gazprom wouldn't exist, and all the Russian oilfields would belong to Chevron.<br><br>National companies like Gazprom controlling national fossil fuel resources means that, eventually, the 5% of humans who are American citizens will eventually have to stop consuming 25% of global resources, with all the dire consequences that evolution will entail (lower real incomes, more poverty, etc). All the American presidents since the collapse of the USSR, 24 years ago, have put the control of global resources higher on the agenda than anything else. They are struggling to do this, and often failing, but only because the US no longer holds all the cards, as it did in the 50's or 60's.<br><br>Similarly, putting Iran down is a must for American politicians who need the support of pro-Israeli donors. In fact, not being pro-Israel enough is often politically suicidal in the USA.<br><br>American politicians are like American car industry executives, who made SUVs long after everybody and themselves had understood that gas-guzzlers had no future, because their companies made more profits on SUVs than on cheaper cars, and if the quarterly profits had been reduced, the shareholders would have fired the executives. Understandably, the executives didn't want to lose their jobs to protect US car companies against their own shareholders. Toyota didn't have that problem, because its policies were still determined not by its shareholders' greed, but by the Toyoda family.<br><br><br><a href=#c7610675146122720898 title="comment permalink">6/18/15, 4:33 AM</a><br><br>

The American position is basically represented by the IMF, which has being taking a very hard stance. That's hardly surprising since there's quite a lot of money involved on the one hand, but equally the fact that the US has never been very happy with the emergence of the Euro as it poses a potential existential threat to the dollar as reserve currency. Nevertheless, you would think that the last thing the US would want would be for Greece to be 'saved' by the Russians. The Greek government has been trying to play this card, but so far it hasn't resulted in a relaxation from the IMF, let alone Uncle Sam stepping into the breach as every Greek's best friend.<br><br>Then there's Germany. On the other side of the divide as far as Greece is concerned, the German's can hardly be happy with a 'proxy war' being fought a hop, skip and a jump away from its borders. Moreover, Germany still needs Russian gas and would be shooting itself in the foot if it broke relations with Russia.

I talk openly about these things with my now-young adult children, but in the rest of the “real world” I am increasingly uncomfortable with attempting to discuss these things at all.

That's gone on long enough now that people are extending these habits of thought into all areas, apparently believing they have no need to concern themselves with physical/material realities at all.

Not that our fine leaders have caught on, of course; they're all determined that Britain is and will remain a significant global power, rather than a rapidly fracturing collection of nations bound together by political alliances which have outlived their usefulness (the first half being true of any polity large enough to encompass multiple regions and identities, and the second about to become more apparent across large parts of the globe). They should hope, instead, that we're irrelevant enough and far enough out of everybody else's way to avoid being caught in the worst of the coming turmoil, but that would require savvy beyond the kind of savvy peculiar to Oxford debating societies and career politics, which is rare enough in the current crop... <br><br>(My grandmother claims to be confident that we are mostly led by well-meaning people who are mostly sensible and know what they're doing. There must be a lot of people, particularly those of older generations who remember better times, who think that. I rarely meet them, and I'm sure they're fewer by the day.)<br><br>It's a strange sensation, trying to look at history both from inside and outside. We view the rise and fall of ancient civilisations as if from beyond: Greece, Rome, Persia, Arabia - they are the appearance and disappearance of great cities, of languages, of agricultural systems and technology and trade and empire. We see our own civilisation from within and we don't realise it's the same thing, the same patterns, reflected in the small things: to us, military bases and loan defaults and arguments with Moscow and China are not part of history; they're simply what we do. When we realise it's not one or the other but simply part of the whole it's easy enough to reconcile the two (but a strange, new way of looking at things, all the same) and that's what all good historians need to do. Some of the most dangerous people are the bad historians - the ones who think history is not any of this but simply the American Revolution followed by the American Civil War followed by two world wars and so on and so forth. Sheer ignorance is one thing; the ones to watch are the ones who have just enough education to convince others they're wise. (A little learning is a dangerous thing.) So of course they're the ones who end up in charge at times like these - the ones who would never think to compare the current triad of USA-Russia-China to the old one of Britain-Germany-USA, or any other point in history. Certainly, in debates over the finer points of economic theory, they miss the whole ebb and flow of time and the repeating patterns - the ways the citizens of Rome were exactly like us and the ways we are exactly like them - comprehension of which would be required to have any hope of navigating this whole mess with some semblance of competence.<br><br>I like "stunad", but may I suggest "glaikit" in addition? It's a Scots word expressing sheer gormlessness. It's not that they don't understand, but that they aren't paying enough attention to even realise there's something they should be understanding.<br><br>My own consolation lies not in Auden but in the thought that people have, throughout history, managed to be about as happy and contented pretty much regardless of where and when they lived. That is, some have always lived in luxury and some have always suffered cruelty, torment and painful death. Perhaps the balance swings further one way or the other at times, but our own civilisation is not (despite its decadence) a particularly happy one nor particularly horrific, and neither extreme ever lasts for long. People can be happy in the midst of prosperity, and even in the midst of the most terrible times they can find joy.<br><br><a href=#c1827930323597186897 title="comment permalink">6/18/15, 7:23 AM</a><br><br>

In my late 60s/early 70s, Right Wing, Bill Buckley-National Review-devouring youth, I learned lots about Commie propaganda [and indirectly Nazi propaganda because Commies were Nazis-lite] and the nature of totalitarian societies. I also learned a great deal about the cultural and political histories of Russia and China.<br><br>Nearly 20 years in Scotland and Germany from the mid 70s to mid 90s permanently immunized me to ideologies and broadened my knowledge of history and the psycho-dynamics of empire considerably. I returned to the US just in time for the GOP takeover of Congress under Gingrich and have since watched a parade of personality types in a profusion matched only by those in Shirer's <i>The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</i> and reports from Cultural Revolution China. Their historical ignorance and amnesia has had me permanently gobsmacked since.<br><br>Thus for 20 years I've been thinking of Thucydides and marveling at how some societies decide to go collectively crazy. Fear is certainly one factor: it's been both the mind killer and background hum to American foreign policy and political life for all of my 64 years. <br><br>Another is the need for enemies. Several months before the Wall came down in 1989 Shevardnadze gave an interview to a German weekly. At the end he said, 'We are not your enemy. We do not want to be your enemy. We will take your enemy away from you. What will you do then?' <br><br>I got my answer 5 years later when Liberals were the new public enemy number one and people like Ann Coulter could publicly advocate the murder of the president and his wife and get away with it. And I see further evidence of that today in friends, most of whose views are in alignment with those you express here, who need Putin to be our "dangerous enemy", the "KGB thug" and so on, ad nauseum. <br><br>An ancient Greek wrote "Those whom the gods would destroy they first make mad." Since I cannot discern, much less accept, the existence of deities that look all too much like human psychoses projected onto the physical world floating among the clouds playing games with societies and cultures, I am very curious about your understanding of the para-logic of the latest empire/society to go collectively gaga. It can't be in the water, can it? A side-effect of Monsanto's latest witches brew perhaps?<br><br>But as you are only the second person in my life to ever refer to Yeats' <i>A Vision</i>; William Irwin Thompson, the cultural historian was the other [back in the spring semester of 1973 in a class I took at Syracuse], I can't help but think that you'll be employing at least some of those excellent insights in that para-logic post whenever it shows up. <br><br>Thanks again and best wishes.

A bad situation with no easy solution. Meanwhile the NASDAQ has hit an all-time high today...<br><br><a href=#c2856727061775844190 title="comment permalink">6/18/15, 9:22 AM</a><br><br>

So you may not get it right in all its particulars but you can for sure get the broad stokes.<br><br>One of the broad strokes I was thinking about is this, even if demography doesn't put Muslims into majority status, it may not matter. <br><br>I can't remember where I read it but I read that the invading Turks numbered only about a hundred thousand when they took over Anatolia. And so the average Turk has only a great-grandparent's worth of genetic inheritance from those invading Asiatic tribes.<br><br>One county per year over about two hundred years, Angles and Saxons came to dominate Britain in the Dark Ages. Even so, they left only a slight genetic imprint, so small were their numbers in relation to the majority inhabitants. <br><br>Despite relatively small numbers of invaders, Turkish is the language of Anatolia, English in the UK. The Romans left their cultural and linguistic imprint all over Europe even though the originating population in Italy was minuscule.<br><br>I think the same may come to apply to Muslims in Europe. They may never be the majority but if they are convinced in the rightness of their religion and the superiority of their culture and are forthright in pursuit of their interests, they could dominate. It doesn't have to be violent either. <br><br>In this place we spent more than a generation strenuously eradicating Christianity from public schools to the point where you couldn't say "Merry Christmas". So what happens next? In one public school with a lot of Muslim students, they now have Friday afternoon prayers in the cafeteria. Ironic, no? <br><br>Muslims simply asked permission and, after a bit of bureaucratic folderol, were granted their wish. No problem. <br><br>It doesn't necessarily follow that what happens in one school can be scaled up to an entire continent. But maybe that's how it could happen, street by street, school by school, people appalled by their own history and unconvinced by their own religion and culture, give way to other people of differing heritage that suffer no such doubts.<br><br>There's another thing, in this time of economic upheaval, the existing powers-that-be make no bones about their preferred course of action being that which caused the mess in the first place. That course of action being, of course, more money for the rich and less for everyone else. <br><br>So picture this, contenders for power - Muslims - showing up with a helping hand and also a radically differing plan. When something stops working and people are hungry they look to new people with new ideas. There could be a willing audience.<br><br><a href=#c3365960445898118323 title="comment permalink">6/18/15, 9:33 AM</a><br><br>

They would build friendly relationships among the border crossers, who knew the back routes into San Diego county so well, occasionally helping a destitute family here and giving medical assistance there. And, if/when, the time came, they would be able to supply light arms and explosives to these strong, tough border crossers from easily pre-positioned caches. <br><br>That led me to discussions with my father who taught courses in political geography at SDSU. He took the discussion with me a bit further. We discussed what it would take to arouse anger in our neighbors to the south, even deep into South America, and how there existed the potential there to build and motivate a huge resistance against the United States, El Norte. <br><br>In a worst case scenario, we discussed how a growing wave of militancy and a growing population of those with a grudge, along with youthful adventurers and other opportunists, could be built deep in the south and propelled north to invade and conquer the once stolen lands of Greater Mexico. A movement such as that could, quite literally, be composed of millions. <br><br>Then, my father set me to imagining how I could stop "millions" of angry young men from making serious, deep incursions into American territory. Think it through long and hard - there aren't a lot of "good" answers - and I don't need to be reminded that the US Navy is in San Diego, because part of what would constitute the "right time" for such an adventure would be a time when our navy is tied down elsewhere in global conflict.<br><br>The potential for such a scenario today is much greater, partly due to our continued arrogance toward our neighbors to the south and also due the great increase in the "Hispanic" population in the US since then. Of course, fear about the potential for this kind of thing happening "Over Here, Over Here" does motivate those on the political right to want to militarize the borders and evict the "foreigners" - that only increases the pressure required to make their worst nightmares come true.<br><br>Russia and China are making major inroads in developing relationships in our southern hemisphere. There is no barrier against them undertaking the same kind of color revolution strategy that we are employing against them in Ukraine, Macedonia, Hong Kong. It would be silly to think that the work hasn't already begun, even as a revival of past cold war efforts. Engaging the US in numerous smaller and larger conflicts abroad can rapidly tie down the US military. And, we have no one else to blame but ourselves for the strong resentments that could easily be amplified among our neighbors. The point that I would like to make, is that we should fully embrace our hemisphere from Alaska to Tierra Del Fuego and make it right (really right) - now isn't too soon to start.<br><br><a href=#c1409780971820634116 title="comment permalink">6/18/15, 12:25 PM</a><br><br>

While I was still employed we had various of the researchers visit us twice and I hosted two of them on one of the visits. I had plenty of time to talk with the two men who came over when I was host and learn of the contrasts between their lives and my own. It was just as interesting to see how much good scientific work they could do with a tiny fraction of the resources we had available to us.<br><br>Count me among you and everyone else who is astonished by how badly we botched it with Russia after Communism ended. Bush the 1st was president then. He should have been quite open to counseling by, among others, the CEO of the corporation I worked for. He'd been Director of the CIA, a US Representative, and Vice President before becoming President, and foreign policy was his main interest as President. If any president would have realized the advantages of courting Russia, of suggesting something along the line of a Marshall Plan for Russia, it seems to me it would have been him. Clinton, on the other hand, had only been governor of Arkansas before becoming President. I wonder what the effect of Bush's winning the 1992 election might have been.

I will suggest a few reasons why:<br>First, BAU today has an aura of invincibility to it that the imperial order of the Great Powers had in the years leading up to the 'Great' War. <br>Second, the previous decade or so has seen repeated flare ups and hardening of the alliance system with the Russo-Chinese alliance on one side, and an American-European-East Asian entente on the other.<br>Third, the shakeup caused by the 'Great' War thoroughly broke the illusion of European Great Power system in a way that BAU has not been challenged in our time. My guess is a decade of proxy wars resulting in general military exhaustion and economic collapse (on the part of all belligerents), would go a very long way towards shaking people's faith in progress and BAU.<br>Fourth, such a shakeup would be similar to the interwar years in Europe, only this time, there would be no USA or colonial empires to prop up living standards in the industrial world. Thus, the war that would happen a generation or so after the first round of proxy wars (say about 2040 or so), would be the round two attempt on the part of the losing powers, to get some amount of revenge. Of course, by that point, resource constraints would quite probably make this the last 'World War' fought between major industrial powers.<br>The next would war would, in my mind, occur in 1500-2000 years or so, and probably involve tall ships, dirigibles, and maybe the rousing cavalry charge or two. Might be fought between the Caliphate of Norseland and the Teocracia Quebecois for control of the Artic Ocean?<br><br><a href=#c4993525000335754120 title="comment permalink">6/18/15, 2:06 PM</a><br><br>

Their mistake was trusting too much on abstractions, such as money.

A Russo-German alliance makes excellent sense for both parties -- just as it did in the years before 1914. (If Wilhelm II hadn't thrown away the excellent relationship with Russia Bismarck built so carefully, the First World War wouldn't have happened, and the Franco-German war of 1915 or so would have been one more German triumph.)<br><br>Marcion, yes, but he went to Elba first, and so will the bureaucrats. <br><br>Vilko, yes, but then stupidity is very often acquired rather than inherited. It's the details of how acquired stupidity comes about that have come to fascinate me of late. More on this in next week's post!<br><br>Hereward, no question, the EU will jump ship the moment Germany decides that the benefits outweigh the costs. <br><br>Dave, true enough. <br><br>Morgenfrue, I know the feeling. It's hard to see what's coming and have nearly everyone else totally oblivious to it!<br><br>Avery, yes, I heard about that. All I did in <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i> was put myself in the shoes of the Chinese government and say, "Okay, given the resources of the Peoples Republic, what can I do?" The answers were pretty obvious. <br><br>Rashakor, once again, they've got to head to Elba first! As for the collapse of the cloud, I was thinking of the collapse of a probability cloud ion quantum physics, where you go from a vague sense of "there must be a Germany in here somewhere" to "Here's Germany" -- but of course then you don't know where it's going and how fast.<br><br>Brian, no argument there. It amazes me that more people haven't noticed that a Brownback is always found in close relation to Brownshirts...<br><br>Mark, one of the real advantages of crisis is precisely that the ordinarily incompetent duffers who run nations the rest of the time very often get hauled away, feet first or otherwise, in favor of those who can actually do the job. So you may be right. <br><br>Twilight, a palpable hit! I sometimes wonder if, thousands of years from now, archeologists of a future civilization excavating the ruins of ancient American cities will find thousands upon thousands of skeletons in the ruins of homes, apartments, and condominiums, showing the telltale signs of death from hunger, still clutching the smartphones with which they were running virtual-food apps.<br><br><a href=#c10290836251919542 title="comment permalink">6/18/15, 3:46 PM</a><br><br>

I'm far from sure how it's doing elsewhere. Nature-centered spirituality -- well, obviously that's where my heart is, but I'd be surprised if it became more than a minority movement anywhere. But we'll see. <br><br>Chloe, thanks for taking that remark in the spirit in which it's meant! The smartest thing Britain could do, in my way of thinking, is to make itself as geopolitically irrelevant as possible, so as to stay out of the line of fire as things start coming apart in a big way. The same excellent common sense that induced Britain to let go of its empire without a fight, and spared it the fate of post-imperial Spain, would be well worth applying again. <br><br>Mr. G, thanks for the information! I'd suspected as much about Brazil, but it's good to get confirmation from someone who sees conditions on the ground. <br><br>Setik, remember that the US military still has an army of occupation in Germany. (Yes, I know, they don't call it that any more, but that's what it is.) Germany's freedom of action is somewhat constrained until the US no longer has a gun pressed to Berlin's collective back. <br><br>Grim, it's already being fought using other methods, including proxy wars, so you may want to widen the range of potentials you're assessing. <br><br>Robo, you're welcome and thank you. <br><br>Wizzard, whatever else is in short supply, potential sources of chaos aren't!

I have no doubt that you and your colleagues are human beings and not, say, cabbages or something, but the vast majority of the people who are affected by the regulations you promulgate, interpret, and/or enforce will never know that. All they see are a steady stream of edicts that, bureaucracy being what it is, will very often be out of touch with the realities of everyday existence, sometimes disastrously so. (The current mess in Greece is a case in point: the economic policies proclaimed by the IMF and the various EU financial bureaucracies as the way to a Greek recovery sometime in the future have never, not once in the history of market economies, resulted in anything but economic disaster and immiseration.) If people try to bring such mismatches to the attention of the bureaucracy, in most cases they might as well go talk to a cabbage instead. That is to say, your facelessness is not a personal issue but a fact of the structure in which you work; unfortunately that fact may not keep you from being sent to Elba or worse in due time. <br><br>Ben, one of the advantages of historical metaphor is that it's possible to apply several different examples to any given case. 1939 is one; 1914 is another; I just spent five weeks talking about 1929 and 1789 along the same lines. One doesn't exclude the usefulness of others!<br><br>Bruno, bingo. It was a classic American move: lucrative in the short term, disastrous in the long term, and plausible only because nobody ever took the time to think about the possibility that the rules of the game could be changed by the other side. <br><br>Ed-M, maybe we should just have a President Hillajeb and call it good. Or, rather, stunningly bad. <br><br>Jean-Vivien, I wonder how soon Ecnarf will be talking about improving ties with Aissur...<br><br>Scotlyn, heck of a good question. If the Pope starts excommunicating Catholics who engage in egregious abuses of the planet, that might make waves. <br><br>Rapier, the Chinese have already made it pretty plain that they're not willing to play the game by our rules -- pay attention to the AIIB, the artificial islands in the South China Sea, etc. A land route from Shanghai to St. Petersburg is enough for now; the extension to Hamburg can follow as soon as Europe implodes. Remember that the men in Beijing know how to play a long game, which is something the US forgot a very long time ago. <br><br>Denys, very good. Yes, that's basically the shape of it at this point. <br><br>Barthys, good. You're paying attention. I'm fairly sure that the propaganda end of things, always the crucial opening wedge, has been under way for well over a decade, and the sort of little random-seeming actions that push all sides closer to an explosion are happening as well.<br><br><a href=#c8958871114019268646 title="comment permalink">6/18/15, 4:48 PM</a><br><br>

As the main stream media has slowly become a corporate oligopoly its effectiveness at dispensing the chosen narrative has gotten better and better. This has been especially true of what reaches the media with regards to Russia's geopolitical position and Chinas military efforts. In Essence, the propaganda has gotten better and better. Because of this I think that the same thing is affecting the U.S. leadership that helped doom the German Leadership during WWII. They have begun to believe their own propaganda. We in on the fringes of the mainstream tend to think there are masters of the universe sitting in underground bunkers with massive computers giving them perfect knowledge of the world situation.

And just yesterday a young, white man at a prayer meeting in an African American church in Charleston, S. Carolina, shot many people, killing nine. This is so upsetting and, to me, anyway, is one more example of the decline of America and the coming disturbances and unrest. As for me, I seem to see death everywhere. My son in law committed suicide 2 1/2 years ago, my best friend died of cancer not long ago. Her vitals, apparently were good up to the end (she had cancer), and then she just died. I think just she got tired of fighting and wanted to go home. My cousin died not long at the age of 60, much too young, considering both of our mothers are still alive, old Irish American women in their 90s. And my other cousin's daughter died, she was only 33, about 6 weeks ago. And my sister got cancer a few months ago and my other sister is slowing dying of some weird mitochondrial mutation, which also killed her daughter at the age of ten. I'm healthy, at the age of 61, but I feel as if people are just giving up. I refuse to give up, I want to live to see how this all turns out!! I'm not worried at all about my future, I can cook, bake all our bread, can make a meal out of anything, spin, weave, knit, sew without patterns (or , better yet, WITH patterns, which I also know how to draft), and can live on next to nothing, which I've had to do several times in my life. And thank you so much for this wonderful space in which I can feel sane. And an early Happy Summer Soltice to you, Mr. Greer! BTW, I ordered one of your books for my son, who seems to be interested in what is REALLY happening in the world, not the lies we hear from the MSM.

Their advance towards Bagdad slowed down to a crawl and then halted completely once they ran out of disgruntled Sunni areas - in Bagdad, they wouldn't be in friendly territory, they'd be in ethnically cleansed neighborhoods consisting entirely of shia who'd probably give them the same sort of welcome they gave the americans.<br><br>If anything, the middle east is moving farther and farther from some sort of unifying idea of what islam is by the day; ISIS considers shia and other "takfir" to be the most pressing enemy, and they go about the task of killing other muslims with extreme gusto.<br><br>Another thing a lot of people miss is that suburbs in europe are <i>extremely</i> heterogenous. They're not filled with "immigrants" or "muslims", but with armenians, druze, shiites from lebanon, political refugees from Iran, and so on. The kids often inherit old family grudges and hatreds from wherever they came from, to boot.<br><br>Basically, I think the middle east generally is going to end up being just as "fratricidal" as Europe in the coming days, and you can already see how social stress is actually reigniting latent hatreds in the suburbs over here, not galvanizing kurds and arabs and iranians into an internal proletariat. <br><br>That being said, I also don't quite see the potential for islam as some sort of unifying religion at the bottom rung of society from another angle. I tend to think that the well has just been far, far too poisoned for most europeans to ever really consider islam, regardless of its merits or wheter it manages to get its act togheter and present some sort of universal appeal rather than the sectarian settling of old grudges we see today. European islamophobia is a beast that has been fed from almost every end of the political spectrum, and given the continent's penchant for religious and ethnic progroms in the past, well... I don't see a lot of good things in the future, to say the least.<br><br><a href=#c7008572962719752622 title="comment permalink">6/18/15, 8:46 PM</a><br><br>

The thing that fascinates me about all the people in the US right now who are claiming that China is about to fall apart is that all the same claims, for nearly all the same reasons, were being made in the 1930s and early 1940s about the United States, by the various fascist leaders in Europe. You'll notice how well that worked out. <br><br>Blueback, just don't lose track of the fact that traditional conservatives are just as vulnerable to ordinary human folly as the people you dislike. <br><br>Blue sun, the British had places to park their senile aristocrats and clueless nouveaux-riches that didn't give them access to power. We weren't so clever. <br><br>Gordon, now that would be a fascinating conversation! When I was in tenth grade, one of my teachers handed me a copy of <i>At the Edge of History</i> and said, "John, you have to read this." That was the same year I first read EF Schumacher and Theodore Roszak, so the timing was good. I haven't followed all of his later work by any means, but his earlier books were important formative influences for me -- as often as not because, disagreeing with him, I was forced to examine my own intuitions and give them clearer form.<br><br>Wizzard, I'm far from sure that labels such as "good" and "bad" mean much when applied to anything but human choices and their consequences. Chaos <i>is</i>; what we choose to do about it can be smart or stupid, graceful or clumsy, generous or selfish, or what have you. Certainly, though, we're going to see a lot of it.

Christianity in the Roman world is a great example, but it's not the only one by a long shot. The other factor to take into account is mass migration -- not the relatively modest influx Europe has seen so far, but tens of millions of people flooding into Europe out of the Middle East and Africa, driven by economic implosion and shortages of food and water. As I've noted here in the past, that's pretty much baked into the cake at this point, and it's going to have profound effects on the demographics and cultural makeup of European nations (as well as the current US, of course). <br><br>Angus, oh, I wouldn't expect a Chinese soldier on every street corner, though you may get a sharp uptick in immigration from China. If Australia switches masters in a timely manner, you may get to keep some of what you've currently got. I'll consider a post on the more general issue of what happens to the client states of major powers when the major powers implode, which should cover that in more detail. <br><br>Sardine, thanks for the links. <br><br>Vincent, I'm quite familiar with the workings of fiat currencies. The point at issue, of course, is that any currency -- fiat or otherwise -- works only so long as all participants act in accordance with the fiction that there's a meaningful connection between the abstract tokens we call "money" and the actual supply of goods and services money can buy. When a government starts paying its bills via the printing press, instead of participating in the normal circulation of money by taking in tax revenues and paying its bills from that sum, the social fiction that makes money work breaks down, usually via hyperinflation or some other form of currency collapse. That's where current US policy is headed. <br><br>Karim, given the forces pushing toward mass migration from the Middle East and Africa to Europe, no, I think it's pretty much a certainty at this point. <br><br>Gabriela, the Donbas war is a proxy war because it's being fought by proxies -- local militias on the one side, Ukrainian troops and local militias on the other -- rather than by the US and Russian armies directly. Of course there's a risk of spillover -- there always is, and that's usually the goal of at least one side in the game -- and of course things can go very, very wrong. <br><br>SMJ, I put that in <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i> purely as a roundabout way of critiquing the excruciatingly hamfisted US policies of today.

To me, though, Oswald Spengler and Thomas Kuhn make considerably more sense when they suggest that cultural and intellectual transformations, like biological evolution itself, are simply ramifying outwards through the space of available possibilities; they're not going anywhere in particular; if there's a narrative pattern that fits the world of our experience, it's something closer to one of those Native American tales where Coyote is strolling along and encountering one thing after another, or perhaps the dreamscape of <i>The Tale of Genji</i>, than it is a nice taut dramatic tale of how we descended into (insert equivalent of vale of tears here) and how we're on our way back out of it.<br><br>Mister R., I like it!<br><br>Scotlyn, many thanks for the links. <br><br>Dorda, I haven't read the book so will withhold judgment.<br><br><a href=#c3349426309498246153 title="comment permalink">6/19/15, 9:49 AM</a><br><br>

The limousin liberals of Europe don't mind islam at all, because they live in places that are hermetically sealed from ever meeting the sort of poor, angry people they embrace in theory.<br><br>It's actually quite interesting that the harshest, most unforgiving criticism of islamic radicalism comes from two places right now in Sweden: from the far right, and from the segregated suburbs themselves. I know you're fond of roman analogies, so you probably know that "the barbarian" was often a rhetorical figure in roman intellectual life, a sort of polemical "other" as much as it was an actual fact of life. So barbarians were unified when romans were divided, barbarians were simple, honest men when romans were conniving and dishonest, barbarian kingship was based on strength of character when in Rome it was simply a matter of greed and backstabbing, and so on.<br><br>The reason why I'm more sceptical about this has to do with the fact that "islam" itself is fracturing at a very decent clip, and that there's essentially zero impetus seen in the segregated areas today to really bury the hatchet on old hatred and ethnic, political and religious differences, these just keep getting worse and worse in tandem with the increasing fracturing seen in the rest of society. The large influx of immigrants is something I've been telling people is inevitable for quite a while now (and whatever else you can say about it, Europe helped make the bed with climate change and destabilizing interventions, complaining about having to lie in it does no one any good!), but if those are immigrants from, say, iran and saudi arabia, the chances of them turning into "muslims" rather than sunnis and shia hellbent on killing each other seems very slim.<br><br>Interestingly enough, the secretary general of Hezbollah himself, Hassan Nasrallah, recently spoke about how he honestly worries about the future of islam itself in a time where sectarian conflicts and brutal killings are alienating as many or more as it is enticing, and when the region seems headed for a thirty-year war in the name of islam rather than christendom. Over here in Europe, chances are good you might actually end up with a sort of mini-version of the same sectarian wars, and increased immigration is just going to increase that risk with time.<br><br>Maybe we can agree to disagree? In my mind, the jury is still out on wheter islam can actually get to the point of being relatively universal and relatively succesful at forming the new go-to faith among the budding internal proletariat. The fact that outright hatred of islam (or, at the very least, hatred of your direct neighbors interpretation of it) tends to grow stronger the farther <b>down</b> you go today makes me a little sceptical, and the risks of self-destruction are not small in a time where the principal focus of jihad has become facing your direct neighbor and uttering a modern day version of the old christian saw: <i>"Kill them all. For the Lord knoweth them that are His".</i><br><br><a href=#c7899898418284114986 title="comment permalink">6/19/15, 10:28 AM</a><br><br>

And especially the inability to learn from past mistakes. <br><br>Now, what makes me cringe is the mantle of towering moral and intellectual superiority that we take on in Canada - and that's especially true of our intelligentsia - when we're discussing American blundering and ham-fistedness. <br><br>I'm not an admirer of our misnamed "intelligentsia", in fact, I disparage it as not being all that smart or accomplished despite its pretensions. And, I'm telling you, for every idiocy you see hatched south of the border you see one to the north, sometimes different in nature, but equally addled. See, for one thing, Ottawa thinks its a good idea to follow the U.S. lead and send Canadian fighter jets to bomb ISIS. Boneheaded, you say?<br><br>So I'll try to steer away from the sniffy superiority. <br><br>There was a discussion on PBS News Hour recently about ISIS and what to do about it. <br><br>If you want to understand the mind-boggling misfires in U.S. foreign policy, you could do worse than watch this little talk. What were on full display were the many misapprehensions about the nature of the world and about the efficacy or lack thereof in U.S. military and diplomatic efforts. <br><br>I'll give Col Bacevich credit for having the clearest take on things, he seemed to understand, likely as a result of bitter experience, the limitations of what can be accomplished by Americans far from American shores. At the other end of the spectrum was Leon Panetta who seemed to be oblivious. In my eyes, Panetta represented, at their most disastrous, conventional American officialdom and their ways of looking at the world. <br><br>As is usual there was talk of American interests. Now, God Bless America, unlike up here, it's not considered unseemly to talk of your own national interests. But there didn't seem to be a corresponding appreciation of the fact that U.S. interests may not be anyone else's. <br><br>Because those damned foreigners may not give a fig about American interests. And it may not penetrate the impermeable intellectual carapace of the American foreign policy elite that those same damned foreigners may have interests of their own and may therefore not be amenable to taking direction from people like Ash Carter. <br><br>I'm sorry, I know there's nothing more tiresome to Americans than some smug, finger wagging foreigner like myself. But I'm not sorry about this: I'm going to break with traditional English-Canadian self-abasement and claim a NATIONAL interest and do the unthinkable, that is, talk about it openly.

It's in our national interest up here that the U.S. (and our own government) recognize that all they've been doing there is swatting a hornet's nest.

A lot of them were evident in Iraq, where it was obvious that US military thinking was still fighting WW2 and Viet Nam. It showed that most of the senior commanders were better at paper shuffling, powerpoint presentations and politics than creatively fighting a guerilla war. Ofcourse that was combined with a spineless retreat from "nation building", and a reluctance to commit sufficient troops to obtain an objective by W.<br> <br>In terms of weapons systems. the government has fallen into two traps. The first is that the massive spending on "defense" is such a political football<br>(jobs and spending in which state for political use) that the civilian politicians now determine what weapons systems will be developed and purchased, <br>and where they will be produced. This has lead to items that, because of per cent age cost limitations of Federal procurement, become the primary target of defense<br>contractors is to make items and systems cost as much as possible. An example - if A costs $300. and you can only make 10% or $30, then you would<br>rather the item costs $30,000. And the politicians are complicit in this. The only recent exception to this was the F-16 aircraft that was almost developed in <br>secret by a military procurement guy, Spinney.<br> <br>This emphasis on maximum cost then dovetails with the emphasis on superweapons that cost lots of money. Kind of like the Nazis in 1945 looking for the super weapon.<br>Many times the military has tried to kill projects that were not achieving good results and were overridden for political considerations.This results in the soldiers in the field, often being equipped with weapons that are very complicated, fragile and/or require a lots of maintenance (defense contractors love that). The costs have risen so high and the politics of weapons sales are so politally motivated, that recently Pakistan has partnered with the Chinese to create a fighter aircraft 80% as good as the US product (some avionics are a bit deficient) at 1/4 the price of a US aircraft. In theory then, 3 super duper F-22 will be facing 12 Chinese planes. Another note- a few years back a young fighter pilot of a Navy F-18 "got a little sideways" when landing on a carrier and ended up in the ocean. Cost of aircraft and Maverick missiles $17 million. And BTW a spark plug for an F-15 costs $15,000.<br> <br>I will give you two concrete examples. In 1973 I was assigned to a mobile battle field level anti-aircraft radar system. It was built to acquire incoming enemy aircraft and transmit the location information to other anti-aircraft units so they could shoot them down. Raytheon built the radar system, and GM built the Gamma Goat vehicle.<br><br>The electronics worked pretty well in the desert where we trained, but once in Germany, the moist climate made radar system breakdowns endemic. <br>The Gamma Goat was a poor choice of vehicle. In the European Completion for a combat vehicle the British entry was an amphibious, articulated, 6 wheel, 4 wheel drive, 4 wheel steered. vehicle it was claimed could climb a 30 " vertical wall. This was design was obtained and given to GM, who modified the original design to install a 2 stroke GM marine diesel engine. The theory was that this was a wheeled vehicle (cheaper to maintain) that could keep up with a tracked vehicle (tanks, armored personnel carriers - very expensive to maintain). For use with the radar system, it was given a trailer with an electric generator to pull (so much for climbing walls). By the time everything was assembled, the vehicle was grossly overload, so it was in no way amphibious anymore and had very poor performance, as the engine was too small and extremely noisy (could not keep up with tanks, etc.).Eventually the Army scraped the entire programs after deploying about 100 systems. I am sure a more expensive replacement has been built.<br><br><br><a href=#c4163540083803383112 title="comment permalink">6/19/15, 1:10 PM</a><br><br>

Everyone seems to be an expert and yet everyone seems to disagree. It's also different for me to read many comments quite clearly coming from a purely US-centric POV. I have to keep reminding myself of that, because it's just not where I'm coming from.<br><br>One facet, I can add to the noise that I don't see being considered here yet is this:<br>The constant (hopeful) predictions about China falling apart keeps looping, in part, I think, because in it's thousands of years of history, It has only really recently been an actually united country, and frankly; even now only loosely held together. Taiwan &amp; Tibet, even Hong Kong and Macau as cases in point , but many rural mainland provinces see themselves in a local sense first and foremost, nationally Chinese second, if that. BUT It's not really all that different to the united or divided states in the US; not totally different than the local identity vs. national identity issues found in Afghanistan. I think our local identities are stronger here than in the US, not nearly as strong as those in Afghanistan. Maybe we're 1/2-way in the middle, but it's a factor.<br><br>The CCP IS facing a constant although low-grade struggle to maintain it's power and relevance over the country as a whole - and even as described above to keep the country AS a whole in anything but name. I think this is and has been on-going and IMHO a very good thing for the ordinary people of China. For the past few decades, the CCP has done this with the carrot of economic uplifting of the masses, but this engine is slowing down and or stalled, even sliding back downhill for some. The catastrophic disaster of the Cultural Revolution did actually serve as a reminder of the potential consequences of stupidly ruling with an iron fist. The Tiananmen Square massacre is memorialized here annually with no interference from the Govt. Hu Jintao was the first president of China to have actually worked, as a child, on a re-education camp during the Cultural Revolution. The current CCP have a very different attitude towards control than did their predecessors. <br><br>Here in HK, last summer's 'Umbrella Revolution' was watched closely by Beijing, but not interfered with. IMHO, This is because after the first night, the student-protesters set up their tents and refused to disperse at the local Govt.'s behest. The police went in with tear-gas, (which was repelled by the students' ever-present sun umbrellas, hence "Umbrella Revolution"). Now MOST Hong Kongers did not and do not support democracy, as they look to the mess the West is in. They don't see it as the answer - yet when the TV showed tear-gas being sprayed on the 1000 to 2000 students - the streets filled in a few hours with 10's of thousands of angry residents from all demographics, Bankers in business suits, Ex-pat moms in yoga pants, grandma's, street-vendors, etc. The police did not intervene again, except to break up brawls between street vendors losing business, triads and protesters in Mong Kok; and the protests lasted another few months before they petered out on it's own. <br>Tear Gas night was briefly reported, stayed alive on social media for awhile then was not discussed much after; but I think this was showed massive turning point in policy for Beijing.<br><br><br><a href=#c4870262782978272148 title="comment permalink">6/19/15, 7:02 PM</a><br><br>

It's not that they are NOT corrupt - but it's different. They do scramble for power and their enemies curiously end up dead, but I think at this stage of China's ascent - there is still more of a thrust for power, glory and legacy than simply retiring obscenely wealthy - asap.<br><br>But The other consideration to your post this week is what we've been talking about all along: Any of these international political war-games are going to be radically trumped, the apple-cart upset and the best laid plans gone awry due to larger global forces; Climate change and unpredictable, harsh weather, diminishing energy to fill the tanks and keep the war-games going. Doesn't it stand to reason, that if China or a Sino-Russian compact are the next hegemony, it will be a very short-lived one? You just can't exert influence if you don't have the gas in the tank to get to your 'spheres of influence'. <br><br>Personally, I think all of our great and massive nations, nation-states, Blocs, etc. are soon unravelling into smaller localized entities. This may take a bit longer here in China, but maybe not. <br><br>That's my 2-cent's worth. :)<br><br><a href=#c7245301307619162398 title="comment permalink">6/19/15, 7:02 PM</a><br><br>

People from far, far away just arrived. They included soldiers with weapons superior to the locals and cheap labour. They started small, got a foot hold and through a combination of guns, germs and steel plus sheer weight of numbers came to dominate the entire continent well within a century.<br><br>I could imagine a Chinese "free trade zone" somewhere in the North, as the foot hold. Likely centered around mining and agriculture. <br><br>After initial success (that is, billions being made by the people who matter) the free trade zones proliferate. The locals don't particularly like it but they don't have the power to stop it and there are trinkets and treats to ease the pain.<br><br>Around the trade zones all sorts of systems are created to deliver services familiar to the Chinese workers, management and security. A financial boom ensues. New towns grow like mushrooms. Existing towns become cities.<br><br>The locals are progressively forced off their land, mostly via lack of affordability.

These brushes were made of whiskers of steel. The Marines, being Marines, were ordered to clean their rifles at every opportunity and keep them spotless.

There is a reluctance to contemplate a conflict without it. As we have seen in various other countries<br>(Viet Nam, Iraq) a US trained army seeming to hold it's own collapses when air support is withdrawn. So what would threaten this superiority? As I previously mentioned, the Pakistani/Chinese fighter (80% as good, 1/4 cost)would. So would a fuel shortage. Weather is always a problem. If a pre-emtive attack on aircraft ocurs, that would. <br><br>Another major weakness is shortage of strtegic items and materials. At present, virtually no transformers for power grids are manufactured in the US.

Virtually every weapon (with the exception of rifles, artillery and mortars, etc.) and weapon system depends on power. When my mobile anti aircraft radar battery went to the field, we burned up 10,000 gallons of diesel fuel a week. US tanks get around 5 mpg. And using drones requires a USAF base, safe from the fighting and well supplied with power. These are some of the reasons the US military loves to fight in fuel rich environments (Iraq?). <br><br>So go back to the battle of Stalingrad. A battle tested army with superior weaponry and smaller numbers was defeated by a larger army of poorly trained men and inferior weaponry. <br>This then returns us to the procurement issue. As current military costs continually escalate<br>fewer and fewer units are manufactured - the best example is aircraft. I have heard the claims that US planes are so superior they can engage 20 aircraft at once. But they only carry 4 missles. <br><br><br><a href=#c3800569876449358430 title="comment permalink">6/20/15, 10:38 AM</a><br><br>

I'm thinking, if the Chinese government is facing a crisis of legitimacy due to stagnating wealth of ordinary Chinese and environmental pollution, that's all the more encouragement for them to get to business with replacing the USA as the dominant global empire. That would bring more wealth to the Chinese and make it easier for them to improve the pollution in their country (they could more easily externalize the pollution to poorer countries).<br><br>One difference between Chinese hegemony and American is the much greater population of China itself, and I wonder how that will affect things. I can imagine a large number of Chinese moving to other parts of the world and staying, in much greater numbers than American expats, more like what happened during European global dominance. As some of the comments have been indicating, Australia may be one place this happens.<br><br>Another candidate could be Canada. Canada has a small population and lots of land that will become more and more valuable as the climate changes and the Arctic melts. I could see Canada as a Chinese client state retaining some semblance of first world conditions for a while after the USA goes down to third world levels, the catch being thaey have to receive an influx of Chinese immigrants, which could quickly dominate the increasingly valuable northern regions and eventually even be the majority in the country as a whole.<br><br>I also wonder if the context of all the issues humanity ias a whole is facing at the moment (peak oil, climate change, environmental destruction etc.) will make China's era of dominance considerably shorter than the USA or Britain had, but even an era of Chinese dominance that's half as long as the USA's was would be one of the defining features of the 21st century.<br><br><a href=#c6063182021616222915 title="comment permalink">6/20/15, 1:02 PM</a><br><br>

However the geopolitical maneuvering plays out, it will take considerable amounts of no-longer abundant energy (and of course, the energy needed for the maneuvering and combat will usually be given priority over other uses.)<br><br>Meanwhile, we've had some dramatic examples recently of the principle that the population of a nation will put up with a large amount of oppression and exploitation -- until they can no longer count on the government to deliver adequate food and water (and of course adequate energy to supply them); then, a revolution becomes very likely.<br><br>As an thought experiment in the US: suppose that, in the near future, with a deepening drought, California can no longer supply its usual large part of the nation's food, and naturally, its economy collapses at the same time, with heavy effects on the rest of the nation's economy. How important will the "grand game" seem to our dear leaders at that point? I would imagine that similar examples could be found in other countries (certainly China is having major water worries among other environmental problems, and Brazil is in deep lack of water).<br><br>I'll leave it to others to suggest weather events on the scale of Sandy or the Australian drought in critical areas of the world, and/or to fold in the effects of other environmental time bombs that our industrial civilization strews around with great abandon.

It would have treated with foreign powers in ways unfavorable to the national interests of the Union. The War of 1812 was about the same distance in the past for them as the Vietnam War is for us.<br><br>After McKinley and TR built the Great White Fleet and opened the Panama Canal, the US had a century of mostly unchallenged control of the western hemisphere (Cuba was contained). This century will be different.<br><br>California is so very far away from Washington and New York that 9/11 had no direct effect on me. I believe this state's economy is less dependent on defense contracts and military bases than it was fifty or sixty years ago. Our domestic market is so big that for decades, we've been passing product safety and environmental laws in advance of Congress, and the manufacturers go along with it. I think our politicians are smart enough not to put California too openly at odds with federal policies on immigration, trade or military matters. As long as we stick by that, I can imagine California becoming a sort of warmer, drier Canada (our population is just about the same) while still flying the Stars and Stripes.

Why? Well, we're not dis-interested. Not even remotely. We have way too many ties, familial and business, in too many countries, especially in the US. We wouldn't fool anyone. And, if you want to know hypocrisy, come on up. We'll show you. <br><br>In any case, do people like Vladimir Putin and John Kerry (or anyone else for that matter) need some buffoon from Ottawa to explain things? <br><br>IMO, effective diplomacy (even for someone PRETENDING to be dis-interested) depends on a couple things which we don't have enough of: money and guns. Money for bribes and guns when bribery doesn't work. <br><br>For decades now I've watched our diplomats get elbowed aside or watched them make speeches to empty rooms at international conferences. Empty, that is, except for a huddle of Canadian cameras and news correspondents. All this posturing. It's an embarrassment. <br><br>Our preening political elites, especially of the "progressive" stripe, try to get a place at the councils of the mighty and claim to us knuckleheads back home that Canada, as the supposed bastion of justice and goodness, is listened to. Hard to believe it's serious. When Obama got elected he was invited to Ottawa. He came but he could hardly be bothered to get off the plane. <br><br>Deception is one thing. Sometimes it works to your advantage. But self-deception is something else, especially in the international arena.

Lots of similarities, parallels to 20th/21st century history coming out of geographical, cyclical developments. Napoleon, like Hitler largely defeated by overwhelming russian reaction. Occupation of eastern europe, suppressions of uprisings post ww2 and 1848/1849 by reactionary russian govt. Secret police, censure in russia holding population back. Existing order in both periods collapsing due to the suppression of creativity, openness in population which hindered technology, growth, efficient reforms resulting in military defeat (rimean war, cold war) and systemic implosion(communism, serfdom). Now as then the ukraine, black sea access issue is a trade/military issue but america intetests dominate western alliance. Russia has reformed and is on upswing so will not be weakened n this new 'crimean war'. Russia, as in 1812 is more simple than west. They burne moscow down and it did not matter as russia was primitive. Russia can survive sanctions, shrinking economy due to resilience. In the west debt makes growth a must. Russia has absorbed, as under Peter the Great and Stalin western modernizations and can wait for the next round of change in the west. Perhaps as against htler and napoleon russia will be seen as saving civilization against tyranny, this time american.<br><br><a href=#c833566579518063089 title="comment permalink">6/21/15, 1:08 PM</a><br><br>

A casual perusal of the US dollar index at [ http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=%24USD ]<br>shows stability of the US dollar over time; and the US Treasury does not have a problem selling new bond issues when looking at results of US Treasury Auctions <br>[ https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/press/press.htm ]<br><br>Security (stock) prices are rising because of investor preferences for seeking higher yields, which happen to be risky.

Did one group benefit at the expense of another group. Absolutely, with the 99% taking the brunt, but I don’t see anyone taking to the streets, except for Occupy, which was tolerated for only so long.<br><br>The US government has not lost its ability to tax and collect thereby giving credibility to the US dollar. Although I do not subscribe to your belief for a government that issues its own currency must have tax receipts equal to its expenditures, even that component of confidence building is displayed by the annual theatrics on the floor of the United States House of Representatives.<br><br>Delusional politicians with vested interests (mostly self) will rail against the budget and deficit with performances worthy of prime time soap opera, but in the end the budget is accepted and the depth ceiling is raised. All is well. And, the band played on.<br><br>These above monetary operations do not lead to hyperinflation or currency collapse, which is caused by external factors, most notably war, foreign denominated debt, or regime change. This scenario is more apropos to the end stages of the era of breakdown to the end of industrial civilization than the current situation.<br><br>For an excellent study of past hyperinflations and its causes, please read (short, succinct, instructive) Hyperinflation – It’s more than just a monetary phenomenon at [ http://www.pragcap.com/hyperinflation-its-more-than-just-a-monetary-phenomenon ]<br><br><a href=#c321497516544821837 title="comment permalink">6/22/15, 1:04 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c6017796987700827554></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/11910035260346318840 rel=nofollow>Janet D</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>One a side note: weather rant. <br><br>We've been running consistently 10-15 degrees above normal for at least six months here in much of the PacNW (we are supposed to hit 108 next week where I live) and mountain snowpack is currently 15% of normal. The dryland farmers in Oregon have pretty much already lost their entire wheat crop due to record desiccating heat in early June. (Some of you may also remember last summer when I posted that Idaho wheat farmers lost almost all of their wheat crop(s) due to 7+ days of hail and heavy rainstorms in the middle of August). Seattle for the past 7-8 years feels like SoCal during the 4 months that now constitute summer, and yet a Seattle maxim used to be that the sun never consistently showed its face until after the 4th of July (and that was my experience while living there for 20 years in the 80's and 90's).<br><br>Texas just finished an amazing drought with record flooding and homes being swept away. A Derecho is currently tearing through the Midwest. And yet we still have politicians (and plenty of people who support them) who claim that AGW is a hoax and the Pope is "Marxist" for even proposing that the issue is real. <br><br>It is difficult to face the reality of a shifting (and I would say vengeful) climate. I've believed in AGW for years, and done what I could to cut my own emissions, but living among the wreckage of shifting weather patterns is doing little to improve my mood or my tolerance for those who wish to proclaim that everything we're doing is just great/fine/wonderful. <br><br>On a practical note, I highly recommend ADR readers experimenting with non-grain-based staple crops: chestnuts, hazelnuts, acorns, etc (and get them planted now) as well as experimenting with amaranth, early potatoes, millet, sorghum, etc - multiple food stuffs that can help ease the years when wheat will be in short supply. Living in one of the top agricultural regions of the US, I'm seeing (and hearing) a LOT now from farmers struggling to maintain their production of annual crops amidst unpredictable weather patterns.<br><br><a href=#c6017796987700827554 title="comment permalink">6/22/15, 1:26 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c345035507921053804></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/11639355105948750191 rel=nofollow>maDrAkDus</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>I've been enjoying this blog for years now, but this is the first time I've felt I really had something to add, so here goes. I tried to keep this brief but didn't seem to manage it so I'm posting this in two parts.<br><br>Part 1 of 2. Moving to Europe<br><br>A year ago (almost exactly) I accepted a job here in Germany and so my wife and I packed up and moved from Canada's West Coast to the region just south of Frankfurt. I work in the entertainment industry as an artist. While in Canada (where we still own a home on a rural island) I enthusiastically followed your Green Wizard advice and became proficient at gardening and together with the active community there developed many self-sufficient skills. We look forward to returning someday. Of the many adjustments we've had to make living here (most of them positive) the one that stands out the most is related to some of the topics of this week's post.<br><br>In a nutshell, I had no idea how uninformed I was living in North America, particularly in regard to world events and what goes on beyond North American shores. I am shocked when talking to my friends and family in Canada to realize how unaware I was and how much I'd accepted the highly filtered news I was exposed to. The fact is, what finally makes it through to the public there is not only a fraction of what is going on, but highly distorted as well. I am eager to share with the readers of your blog (one of the last bastions of intelligent discourse still available online) a small sampling of what I've learned.<br><br>First off, before moving here I too was worried about the stability of Europe and the long term prospects. The reality however has little bearing on what is presented in NA media! I am surrounded by the most highly educated group of people I have ever met (university education in Germany is free!). I'm not talking about a small group - I mean almost everybody. From the depths of training and pride that the trades exhibit (construction workers, gardeners, plumbers, bakers, etc) to the artists, programmers and other 'professionals' that I work with, the results of a high quality education system are evident everywhere! This presents itself in a highly maintained infrastructure and efficient systems from social services (not a dirty word here) to public transportation. Almost everybody speaks two languages and many speak three or more. Across the entire age spectrum, people are in excellent health and it is common to see the elderly and pre-schoolers alike riding their bicycles everywhere! I could go on and on but suffice to say, if all the systems shut down simultaneously here and in North America, Europeans would fare better simply because they have so much more distance to cover before they hit bottom. The social conscience alone would help Europeans fare better, on top of a system of agriculture and services not dominated by mega-corporations. Of course, things are not perfect here but the point I'm trying to make is that it is a completely different world, possibly unimaginable to those who haven't lived here.<br><br>In the next part, what I've learned...<br><br><a href=#c345035507921053804 title="comment permalink">6/22/15, 2:09 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c2877165607971885515></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/11639355105948750191 rel=nofollow>maDrAkDus</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Part 2 of 2 - A European Perspective<br><br>What I have learned about the world since moving to Germany leaves me embarrased about what I thought I knew.<br><br>Regarding Russia, while nobody things Putin is a nice guy, he is not demonized and it is clear to most how much his behaviour is a reaction to outrageous American meddling in his back yard, with the situation in the Ukraine as the most obvious example. Imagine the USA's response if Russia (or China) started investing heavily in Mexico and becoming involved in its politics and you have some idea of what is going on in Russia. There are major American corporations staking claims in the Ukraine and influencing the politics there to serve their free-market capitalist ideologies. Any move that Putin makes is then presented in North America as an act of aggression whereas from a European point of view he is recognized as a caged wolf being poked with sharp sticks.<br><br>China has also been quietly busy building relationships with Europe. Last summer a trade center opened using the Yuan and Euro as its active currencies. There is a 10 year project building a high speed railway from China to Berlin underway. In fact China hardly makes the news here at all except in regard to trade deals as mentioned or other common news items such as weather or political goings on. China is not seen as a threat but as a developing trading partner.<br><br>News out of Africa is common here too. I don't mean just the scary grief-porn of Ebola and Boko Haram but regular news about regular stuff. Things I never heard about in Canada. The same is true regarding the Middle East. The reporting is much more balanced, not simply demonizing those that oppose the US or Israel's interests but looking at both sides of the conflicts and getting into the lives of the people on the ground. The NA bias that I used to believe as fact simply doesn't show up here. I feel like I've been on another planet for most of my adult life. I have learned more about Africa and the Middle East in the past year than in the rest of my life!<br><br>I could go on but I hope I've made my point. Things in Europe are not as they appear from a North American perspective. The social fabric and infrastructure is strong and far more able to withstand the current influx of refugees and economic turmoil than implied by the likes of CNN and Faux news. <br><br>BTW, CNN is a completely different station here, sharing the logo but little else. Fox New doesn't exist, thankfully.<br><br>If you've gotten this far, thanks for reading and if you're living in Canada or the USA, take everything you read or hear with a generous dose of skepticism! My wife and I are enjoying ourselves but look forward to returning to our garden and community in Western Canada in a few more years.<br><br><a href=#c2877165607971885515 title="comment permalink">6/22/15, 2:09 PM</a><br><br>

Per my observation anyone trying to separate from the collective morality is punished by the collective and pushed and pulled to get back in line, deviation from the collective moral norm towards individuation raises a red flag.<br><br>Simple examples from the area I live in the West related to government regulators. <br><br>• Those in the neighborhood who have a rain barrel attached to a roof rain downspout are preyed upon by city inspectors, same with large gardens (Got to fine you for that water barrel, you have to get rid of it /got a permit for that garden?) Clover/dandelions in the lawn along with grass? (Oh My! We should fine you). <br><br>• All is legally and morally fine if one wants to dump a couple tons of herbicide/pesticide on the lawn yearly and have it wash into the watershed. (no permit for chemicals needed) as long as we keep the turf of moral mono culture going green all is well. <br><br>• What difference does it make if “I” pollute? “We” will take care of the problem with some grand solution “I” will have to pay for even if “I” did not pollute or cause one whit of input to the problem “We” have? <br><br>In the paternalistic morality of the collective: Self Sufficiency = Bad, Dependency = Good. CLOVER = BAD, HERBICIDE = GOOD! Use only city water! Good citizen! Nice little piece of garbage! Stay dependent on the collective; there you go, doesn’t that feel that better?<br><br>In my opinion it should be against the law to dump chemicals <br><br>The West’s moral system in my view is all about collectivism of the “We” of dependency. I hope “We” are reaching peak “We” from a moral perspective. I believe collectivism has diluted personal responsibility resulting in the tragedy of the commons we see now. <br><br>The collective will make “me” conform even if it makes life support problems worse as long as such contributes to continuation of the norm no matter how horrible the norm is to everyone from a life support perspective. Human Nature is about getting others to be like US the “WE “should be the “I”. <br>As long as “They” don’t get with the program, “We” have a problem. <br><br>Derv. Thanks for your comments, helped me hone my values. Sure I can’t tempt you into more individuation? OMG I’m turning into a collectivist! :&gt;) best !
