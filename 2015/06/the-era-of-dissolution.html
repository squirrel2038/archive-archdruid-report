<div class=MsoNormal>
The last of the five phases of the collapse process we’ve been discussing here in recent posts is the era of dissolution. (For those that haven’t been keeping track, the first four are the eras of pretense, impact, response, and breakdown). I suppose you could call the era of dissolution the Rodney Dangerfield of collapse, though it’s not so much that it gets no respect; it generally doesn’t even get discussed. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To some extent, of course, that’s because a great many of the people who talk about collapse don’t actually believe that it’s going to happen. That lack of belief stands out most clearly in the rhetorical roles assigned to collapse in so much of modern thinking. People who actually believe that a disaster is imminent generally put a lot of time and effort into getting out of its way in one way or another; it’s those who treat it as a scarecrow to elicit predictable emotional reactions from other people, or from themselves, who never quite manage to walk their talk. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Interestingly, the factor that determines the target of scarecrow-tactics of this sort seems to be political in nature. Groups that think they have a chance of manipulating the public into following their notion of good behavior tend to use the scarecrow of collapse to affect other people; for them, collapse is the horrible fate that’s sure to gobble us up if we don’t do whatever it is they want us to do. Those who’ve given up any hope of getting a response from the public, by contrast, turn the scarecrow around and use it on themselves; for them, collapse is a combination of Dante’s Inferno and the Big Rock Candy Mountain, the fantasy setting where the wicked get the walloping they deserve while they themselves get whatever goodies they’ve been unsuccessful at getting<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>in the here and now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Then, of course, you get the people for whom collapse is less scarecrow than teddy bear, the thing that allows them to drift off comfortably to sleep in the face of an unwelcome future. It’s been my repeated observation that many of those who insist that humanity will become totally extinct in the very near future fall into this category. Most people, faced with a serious threat to their own lives, will take drastic action to save themselves; faced with a threat to the survival of their family or community, a good many people will take actions so drastic as to put their own lives at risk in an effort to save others they care about. The fact that so many people who insist that the human race is doomed go on to claim that the proper reaction is to sit around feeling very, very sad about it all does not inspire confidence in the seriousness of that prediction—especially when feeling very, very sad seems mostly to function as an excuse to keep enjoying privileged lifestyles for just a little bit longer.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So we have the people for whom collapse is a means of claiming unearned power, the people for whom it’s a blank screen on which to project an assortment of self-regarding fantasies, and the people for whom it’s an excuse to do nothing in the face of a challenging future. All three of those are popular gimmicks with an extremely long track record, and they’ll doubtless all see plenty of use millennia after industrial civilization has taken its place in the list of failed civilizations. The only problem with them is that they don’t happen to provide any useful guidance for those of us who have noticed that collapse isn’t merely a rhetorical gimmick meant to get emotional reactions—that it’s something that actually happens, to actual civilizations, and that it’s already happening to ours. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
From the three perspectives already discussed, after all, realistic questions about what will come after the rubble stops bouncing are entirely irrelevant. If you’re trying to use collapse as a boogeyman to scare other people into doing what you tell them, your best option is to combine a vague sense of dread with an assortment of cherrypicked factoids intended to make a worst-case scenario look not nearly bad enough; if you’re trying to use collapse as a source of revenge fantasies where you get what you want and the people you don’t like get what’s coming to them, daydreams of various levels and modes of dampness are far more useful to you than sober assessments; while if you’re trying to use collapse as an excuse to maintain an unsustainable and planet-damaging SUV lifestyle, your best bet is to insist that everyone and everything dies all at once, so nothing will ever matter again to anybody. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
On the other hand, there are also those who recognize that collapse happens, that we’re heading toward one, and that it might be useful to talk about what the world might look like on the far side of that long and difficult process. I’ve tried to sketch out a portrait of the postcollapse world in last year’s series of posts here on Dark Age America, and I haven’t yet seen any reason to abandon that portrait of a harsh but livable future, in which a sharply reduced global population returns to agrarian or nomadic lives in those areas of the planet not poisoned by nuclear or chemical wastes or rendered uninhabitable by prolonged drought or the other impacts of climate change, and in which much or most of today’s scientific and technological knowledge is irretrievably lost. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The five phases of collapse discussed in this latest sequence of posts is simply a description of how we get there—or, more precisely, of one of the steps by which we get there. That latter point’s a detail that a good many of my readers, and an even larger fraction of my critics, seem to have misplaced. The five-stage model is a map of how human societies shake off an unsustainable version of business as usual and replace it with something better suited to the realities of the time. It applies to a very wide range of social transformations, reaching in scale from the local to the global and in intensity from the relatively modest to the cataclysmic. To insist that it’s irrelevant because the current example of the species covers more geographical area than any previous example, or has further to fall than most, is like insisting that a law of physics that governs the behavior of marbles and billiards must somehow stop working just because you’re trying to do the same thing with bowling balls. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A difference of scale is not a difference of kind. Differences of scale have their own implications, which we’ll discuss a little later on in this post, but the complex curve of decline is recognizably the same in small things as in big ones, in the most as in the least catastrophic examples. That’s why I’ve used a relatively modest example—the collapse of the economic system of 1920s America and the resulting Great Depression—and an example from the midrange—the collapse of the French monarchy and the descent of 18th-century Europe into the maelstrom of the Napoleonic Wars—to provide convenient outlines for something toward the upper end of the scale—the decline and fall of modern industrial civilization and the coming of a deindustrial dark age. Let’s return to those examples, and see how the thread of collapse winds to its end. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As we saw in last week’s thrilling episode, the breakdown stage of the Great Depression came when the newly inaugurated Roosevelt administration completely redefined the US currency system. Up to that time, US dollar bills were in effect receipts for gold held in banks; after that time, those receipts could no longer be exchanged for gold, and the gold held by the US government became little more than a public relations gimmick. That action succeeded in stopping the ghastly credit crunch that shuttered every bank and most businesses in the US in the spring of 1933. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Roosevelt’s policies didn’t get rid of the broader economic dysfunction the 1929 crash had kickstarted. That was inherent in the industrial system itself, and remains a massive issue today, though its effects were papered over for a while by a series of temporary military, political, and economic factors that briefly enabled the United States to prosper at the expense of the rest of the world. The basic issue is simply that replacing human labor with machines powered by fossil fuel results in unemployment, and no law of nature or economics requires that new jobs can be found or created to replace the ones that are eliminated by mechanization. The history of the industrial age has been powerfully shaped by a whole series of attempts to ignore, evade, or paper over that relentless arithmetic. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Until 1940, the Roosevelt administration had no more luck with that project than the governments of most other nations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It wasn’t until the Second World War made the lesson inescapable that anyone realized that the only way to provide full employment in an industrial society was to produce far more goods than consumers could consume, and let the military and a variety of other gimmicks take up the slack. That was a temporary gimmick, due to stark limitations in the resource base needed to support the mass production of useless goods, but in 1940, and even more so in 1950, few people recognized that and fewer cared. It’s our bad luck to be living at the time when that particular bill is coming due. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The first lesson to learn from the history of collapse, then, is that the breakdown phase doesn’t necessarily solve all the problems that brought it about. It doesn’t even necessarily take away every dysfunctional feature of the status quo. What it does with fair reliability is eliminate enough of the existing order of things that the problems being caused by that order decline to a manageable level. The more deeply rooted the problematic features of the status quo are in the structure of society and daily life, the harder it will be to change them, and the more likely other features are to be changed: in the example just given, it was much easier to break the effective link between the US currency and gold, and expand the money supply enough to get the economy out of cardiac arrest, than it was to break a link between mechanization and unemployment that’s hardwired into the basic logic of industrialism. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What this implies in turn is that it’s entirely possible for one collapse to cycle through the five stages we’ve explored, and then to have the era of dissolution morph straight into a new era of pretense in which the fact that all society’s problems haven’t been solved is one of the central things nobody in any relation to the centers of power wants to discuss. If the Second World War, the massive expansion of the petroleum economy, the invention of suburbia, the Cold War, and a flurry of other events hadn’t ushered in the immensely wasteful but temporarily prosperous boomtime of late 20th century America, there might well have been another vast speculative bubble in the mid- to late 1940s, resulting in another crash, another depression, and so on. This is after all what we’ve seen over the last twenty years: the tech stock bubble and bust, the housing bubble and bust, the fracking bubble and bust, each one hammering the economy further down the slope of decline. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
With that in mind, let’s turn to our second example, the French Revolution. This is particularly fascinating since the aftermath of that particular era of breakdown saw a nominal return to the conditions of the era of pretense. After Napoleon’s final defeat in 1815, the Allied powers found an heir to the French throne and plopped him into the throne of the Bourbons as Louis XVIII to well-coached shouts of “Vive le Roi!” On paper, nothing had changed.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In reality, everything had changed, and the monarchy of post-Napoleonic France had roots about as deep and sturdy as the democracy of post-Saddam Iraq. Louis XVIII was clever enough to recognize this, and so managed to end his reign in the traditional fashion, feet first from natural causes. His heir Charles X was nothing like so clever, and got chucked off the throne after six years on it by another revolution in 1830. King Louis-Philippe went the same way in 1848—the French people were getting very good at revolution by that point. There followed a Republic, an Empire headed by Napoleon’s nephew, and finally another Republic which lasted out the century. All in all, French politics in the 19th century was the sort of thing you’d expect to see in an unusually excitable banana republic. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The lesson to learn from this example is that it’s very easy, and very common, for a society in the dissolution phase of collapse to insist that nothing has changed and pretend to turn back the clock. Depending on just how traumatic the collapse has been, everybody involved may play along with the charade, the way everyone in Rome nodded and smiled when Augustus Caesar pretended to uphold the legal forms of the defunct Roman Republic, and their descendants did exactly the same thing centuries later when Theodoric the Ostrogoth pretended to uphold the legal forms of the defunct Roman Empire. Those who recognize the charade as charade and play along without losing track of the realities, like Louis XVIII, can quite often navigate such times successfully; those who mistake charade for reality, like Charles X, are cruising for a bruising and normally get it in short order. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Combine these two lessons and you’ll get what I suspect will turn out to be a tolerably good sketch of the American future. Whatever comes out of the impact, response, and breakdown phases of the crisis looming ahead of the United States just now—whether it’s a fragmentary mess of successor states, a redefined nation beginning to recover from a period of personal rule by some successful demagogue or, just possibly, a battered and weary republic facing a long trudge back to its foundational principles, it seems very likely that everyone involved will do their level best to insist that nothing has really changed. If the current constitution has been abolished, it may be officially reinstated with much fanfare; there may be new elections, and some shuffling semblance of the two-party system may well come lurching out of the crypts for one or two more turns on the stage. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
None of that will matter. The nation will have changed decisively in ways we can only begin to envision at this point, and the forms of twentieth-century American politics will cover a reality that has undergone drastic transformations, just as the forms of nineteenth-century French monarchy did. In due time, by some combination of legal and extralegal means, the forms will be changed to reflect the new realities, and the territory we now call the United States of America—which will almost certainly have a different name, and may well be divided into several different and competing nations by then—will be as prepared to face the next round of turmoil as it’s going to get. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Yes, there will be a next round of turmoil. That’s the thing that most people miss when thinking about the decline and fall of a civilization: it’s not a single event, or even a single linear process. It’s a whole series of cascading events that vary drastically in their importance, geographical scope, and body count. That’s true of every process of historic change. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It was true even of so simple an event as the 1929 crash and Great Depression: 1929 saw the crash, 1930 the suckers’ rally, 1931 the first wave of European bank failures, 1932 the unraveling of the US banking system, and so on until bombs falling on Pearl Harbor ushered in a different era. It was even more true of the French Revolution: between 1789 and 1815 France basically didn’t have a single year without dramatic events and drastic changes of one kind or another, and the echoes of the Revolution kept things stirred up for decades to come. Check out the fall of civilizations and you’ll see the same thing unfolding on a truly vast scale, with crisis after crisis along an arc centuries in length. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The process that’s going on around us is the decline and fall of industrial civilization. Everything we think of as normal and natural, modern and progressive, solid and inescapable is going to melt away into nothingness in the years, decades, and centuries ahead, to be replaced first by the very different but predictable institutions of a dark age, and then by the new and wholly unfamiliar forms of the successor societies of the far future. There’s nothing inevitable about the way we do things in today’s industrial world; our political arrangements, our economic practices, our social instutions, our cultural habits, our sciences and our technologies all unfold from industrial civilization’s distinctive and profoundly idiosyncratic worldview.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So does the central flaw in the entire baroque edifice, our lethally muddleheaded inability to understand our inescapable dependence on the biosphere that supports our lives. All that is going away in the time before us—but it won’t go away suddenly, or all at once. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Here in the United States, we’re facing one of the larger downward jolts in that prolonged process, the end of American global empire and of the robust economic benefits that the machinery of empire pumps from the periphery to the imperial center. Until recently, the five per cent of us who lived here got to enjoy a quarter of the world’s energy supply and raw materials and a third of its manufactured products. Those figures have already decreased noticeably, with consequences that are ringing through every corner of our society; in the years to come they’re going to decrease much further still, most likely to something like a five per cent share of the world’s wealth or even a little less. That’s going to impact every aspect of our lives in ways that very few Americans have even begun to think about. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All of that is taking place in a broader context, to be sure. Other countries will have their own trajectories through the arc of industrial civilization’s decline and fall, and some of those trajectories will be considerably less harsh in the short term than ours. In the long run, the human population of the globe is going to decline sharply; the population bubble that’s causing so many destructive effects just now will be followed in due time by a population bust, in which those four guys on horseback will doubtless play their usual roles. In the long run, furthermore, the vast majority of today’s technologies are going to go away as the resource base needed to support them gets used up, or stops being available due to other bottlenecks. Those are givens—but the long run is not the only scale that matters. </div>
<br>It’s not at all surprising that the foreshocks of that immense change are driving the kind of flight to fantasy criticized in the opening paragraphs of this essay. That’s business as usual when empires go down; pick up a good cultural history of the decline and fall of any empire in the last two millennia or so and you’ll find plenty of colorful prophecies of universal destruction. I’d like to encourage my readers, though, to step back from those fantasies—entertaining as they are—and try to orient themselves instead to the actual shape of the future ahead of us. That shape’s not only a good deal less gaseous than the current offerings of the Apocalypse of the Month Club (internet edition), it also offers an opportunity to do something about the future—a point we’ll be discussing further in posts to come. </div>

Things look like they've returned to normal, but it's a completely new normal.

Each time, the most important issue of the crisis was solved, more or less, but the unresolved issues formed the seeds of the crisis of the next cycle. That's what I expect of this crisis, too. As long as we have a representative republic with single-member districts and first-past-the-post winners, <a href=http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2014/07/duvergers-law-works-response-to-kunstler.html rel=nofollow>Duverger's Law will prevail</a> and your prediction of a "shuffling semblance of the two-party system" re-establishing itself will come true.

The first is to learn to use the Versalog 1460 slide rule that I acquired online complete with the excellent instruction manual "Versalog II Slide Rule Instruction Manual and Applied Text" by George John Zanotti. What hours of enjoyment and research I've had in renewing my understanding of the problems the slide then assists in solving. Heck I even got sidetracked into the Khan Academy courses in calculus when Zanotti began applying the rule to differential equations. The cracks we can wiggle through to a whole new world of wonder! <br><br>The second task is learning morse code. I've finally found a use for my gifted iPad. A free app for teaching code using the Koch method is finally paying dividends. This has been the most difficult of the tasks partially as a result of a bad start. My advice to any others who would learn this is to start with a 26 character speed and a 15 word per minute overall speed. You are then learning rhythms with no chance of a cruch of a mental look up table. I'm not near as bright as I look and after six months I've mastered only 27 of the 43 characters at this speed. But it's a daily ritual as predictable as breakfast and it feels good. My goal is to be able to words, even phrases much as we do when we speak.<br><br>The last task is one I've just started and that is to build a simple radio from scratch. I finally found an instruction manual that promises to teach me. But the spring gardening chores have this project on hold. Winters are long here in the interior of BC, so the project waits on my workbench until then. <br><br>I credit this flurry of activity and the resulting sense of purpose to your writings and encouragement. I've even introduced a friend to your blog who has in turn all of his adult children reading it. He too has been motivated to act and is now the proud owner of a pair of bolt\ chain cutters. He figures that in the future there will be a lot more locks and will be ready for them. It's a start.<br><br><a href=the-era-of-dissolution.html#c2654632293686404941 title="comment permalink">6/10/15, 9:17 PM</a><br><br>

Of course they were dismissed as hopeless naysayers peddling pointless doom and gloom. I don't happen to know whether they had many equivalents in 1780s France, though Talleyrand noted at the time of the Diamond Necklace scandal in 1785 that it might overturn the throne. (A good many historians have suggested that he was right, at least to the extent that the scandal finished off whatever remaining credibility the French monarchy had left.)<br><br>JoHio, okay, now please take a moment to notice how exactly your two options match the standard Hollywood cliches about catastrophe. The answer, of course, is none of the above; people in collapse situations generally act like people in every other situation, that is to say, with the mixed motives and unpredictable responses for which our species is generally noted. <br><br>Pinku-sensei, "return to normal" is only one of the ways the era of dissolution can unfold. It can also take the shape of a prolonged period of business as <i>un</i>usual, as (for example) the US from 1937 or so until the 1950s boom. As for the end of US hegemony, that's happening so quickly right now that I don't think there'll be any need to worry about delay. I suspect future historians will consider 2015 the year that the cracks gaped wide -- between the accelerating failure of US stealth interventions in Syria and Ukraine and the rise of the new Chinese-led AIIB bank, the writing is right there on the wall. <br><br>IR Orchard, that's a question a lot of us need to be asking ourselves right now. <br><br>David, delighted to hear it.

Now this has changed for me.<br><br>Like many, I have become disenfranchised with the narrative that I was brought up with. It seems so cold, disheartening, and incomplete. In searching for a new narrative with which to live my life from. I've walked down many roads that I would never have dreamed of entering even five years ago. I've considered new age religion, I've crossed cultural and personal boundaries in trying out psychedelics, I've considered the occult and other fringe ideas. Things have changed so much that if I was to go back in time and met myself ten years ago, the fellow wouldn't recognize what I have become. <br><br>Surely, as the religious head of the Druids of America you've likely expected that some of your readers would tune into your thinking, and even consider 'converting' to becoming druids? (Not that I'm at that point right now) Still it has occurred to me that attracting a popular following to Druid culture is at least a partial personal motivation for writing this weekly blog. <br><br>There is an old story of a Zen master who lived at the top of a mountain, who would offer to teach anyone who asked of the Zen knowledge and practices that he performed. One day a warrior king approached him and sought to know Zen, and like all others, the Zen master welcomed him in. The warrior king sat at his table and the Zen master began his teaching by pouring the warrior a cup of tea. He filled the warriors cup to the brim, and then allowed it to overflow, on to the table and on to the floor. He kept pouring and eventually the king shouted, 'You fool, your spilling the tea onto my garments'! At which point the Zen master stopped and told the warrior king that his mind is like the tea cup, overflowing. That he could not teach Zen to someone who's mind is already full, and that he should only come back when his cup was empty.<br><br>This was me in many ways. I'd say my cup was full, but now it's empty and I'm looking for a new way of being. However there is such a great amount of 'bad ideas' out there in society right now that I don't know where to begin? Take the fellow in the video below, he believe in a combination of Christianity, Buddhism, new age religion, scientific quantum probability and what have you..., yet he is fully convinced that his way is right. Where to begin in pursuing a new narrative?<br><br>https://youtu.be/St8Nr_wghQw<br><br><br><br><br><a href=the-era-of-dissolution.html#c6140671621317205726 title="comment permalink">6/10/15, 9:29 PM</a><br><br>

There is no chance of stopping the runaway boulder at all, but it is possible to redirect its path off to the side and away from here. Massive wildfires can be approached with a similar strategy.<br><br>Mind you, I don't expect goodies as a result of the actions being taken here. Goodies are an end point anyway so shouldn't really be a proper goal for anyone, I'm looking for future local energy flows when other people have difficulty accessing the declining centralised energy flows that they've become so used to.<br><br>Rodney Dangerfield, Caddyshack - nuff said. Some amusing and memorable quotes but overall it makes for very uncomfortable viewing. Some films translate well across time, but that was not one of them.<br><br>Very amusing: "the sort of thing you’d expect to see in an unusually excitable banana republic." I'm still chuckling to myself about that one. Nice work.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br>PS: There is a new blog entry up <a href=http://ferngladefarm.blogspot.com.au/ rel=nofollow>Ripped off</a> where I reveal exactly how I was taken by people whom I'd known for years. The conclusion I took from that experience is to be wary because people are catabolising social capital in order to maintain their own wealth. Not good. I'm preserving heaps of olives. More firewood has been stored for the winter. More concrete stairs were constructed. Tomatoes are now pretty much at the end of the season (it is early winter here) and I show the solar power system statistics for the week. That winter solstice is fast approaching. Plus more house construction stuff. Lots of cool photos too.<br><br><a href=the-era-of-dissolution.html#c7364001852159333965 title="comment permalink">6/10/15, 9:40 PM</a><br><br>

For the <a href=http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2012/07/longterm-unemployment-burtless rel=nofollow>Long-Term Unemployed</a> collapse is not a pretence. Collapse they may not understand; it is already experienced by them as day to day pain. A fact of life that coexists with another fact of life. There are still people doing quite well to whom goodies of the extractive pyramid flow freely. People in this category should they understand collapse deserve your censure, they imagine a Dante’s Inferno / Big Rock Candy Mountain fantasy. <br><br>If someone unemployed is lucky enough to climb out of being socially cast out and not having any resources. Say by getting a dream job; their situation is still like a survivor from a sinking ship. Plucked from the ocean into a lifeboat the first thing to do is get warm. Time and effort to get out of the way of collapse must wait for some. Collapse happens, but before planning for the far side of collapse, the near side of collapse and immediate circumstances may be quite enough to worry about. <br><br>There is a historical side to collapse; but the reductions in population you describe will not just happen like words on a page. There will be tragedy and pain along the way. There will be no promised land at the end of our collapse journey. No land of milk and honey awaits. All that awaits is a chance for simple survival. Getting out of the way may be hard for someone already experiencing the effects of the era of dissolution. Business as usual for some and pain and suffering for others.

I have taken some steps - more serious food gardening, learning some crafts so I can make rather than buy some of the 'stuff' that I need, buying older technology second-hand to simplify my life. In order to expand my pool of ideas of what might be possible I have started a survey of the novels published between 1890 through 1950s in my bookcases. When reread as anthropological studies, they offer a fascinating window into living better with less.<br><br>From Nevil Shute characters who routinely bicycle an hour each way to meet up for picnics and fishing, to Anne of Green Gables who chops the heads off chickens between being overly dramatic and quoting lots of poetry, and who also lives, perfectly happily, in houses without running water until her late twenties, to Agatha Christie characters who attend to the beehives in their back gardens in between murdering their neighbours, it is such an insight into what may soon become the 'new normal'.<br><br>I think this exercise is most useful, because it illustrates that life without all our 'goodies' can go on and be rich and various and interesting, and that living without cars, electricity, phones or running water doesn't mean we will all become vagrants or barbarians.<br><br>Thanks for the continual reminder that there are more than two options for the future; continued technological progress or descent into complete chaos. I for one am happy that learning to knit socks and braving up to keep chickens and make cheese, whilst still reading poetry and solving murder mysteries are another option for my future..<br><br><br><a href=the-era-of-dissolution.html#c5317431944673937957 title="comment permalink">6/10/15, 10:43 PM</a><br><br>

The importance of that cannot be overstated considering the gigantic amount of manure currently being shoveled out as "Appropriate responses", mostly by the corporations intent on selling their disaster preparedness products. Spending every penny on a fully stocked concrete bunker with two dozen firearms and 100,000 rounds of ammunition makes perfect sense, except if you built it in California's central valley. Constructing a medieval type castle in Florida, complete with catapult, as one "Prepper" did may seem reasonable, until rising sea level leaves them ankle deep in alligators. <br>I am not picking on "Preppers", but on the stomach-churning manner said corporations exploit their concern regarding a worrisome future.

The ability to do so is confounded by the fact that collapse, measured by whatever metric one chooses, is expected to be fractal like and step like. Being “fractal like” just means that the curve looks the same independent of scale – just like stock market graphs for a month look much the same as for a day. <br><br>If you are in the middle of things, this is very disorienting.<br><br>Basically the steepness of the curve is obscured by random jittery noise. Only when you step back and look at it on a long time scale of decades and centuries will one see the overall shape of the curve and then be able to label it using your schema of Pretense, Impact, Response, and Dissolution.<br><br>Being fractal, each step down will also contain its eras of Pretense, Impact, Response, and Dissolution but on a smaller time - and likely geographic - scale.<br><br>I expect the question for me to be always, “How far down are we going this time?”. There is no clear answer except, “Not all the way. This is going to take time.” Having some idea of the extent of the next drop is important for planning to surf one's way down. For instance, I'm banking on small engines being useable and maintainable in the short term. If they won't be, I'll be cold and hungry for real. <br><br>“Collapse now and beat the rush.” is good advice, but the pressing issue for those capable of responding to it is, “OK, but collapse how much?” There is a long way from here (a fully industrial life style) and say whatever end point seems most likely to you on whatever time scale you care to choose. If I restrict my time frame to a decade or two, I'm guessing low tech small engines (stuff I can repair myself - assuming the parts are still available) and plenty of hand tools seems a good bet for now. Does this sound about right?<br><br>This sort of planning is crucial for those, like myself, with children. I'm still straddling the fence on career advice for my kids. All the issues of values, expectations, hopes, fears, entitlement, unresolved desires etc. come lumbering out of their dank caves in one's subconscious when discussing direction for children. Its not some intellectual game when you try to give good advice to those you love. So I followed last weeks discussion along those lines with interest. <br><br>All I've come up with is very practical education (trades and the basic – i.e. real and enduring - professions) seems to be the ticket for now vice say a full commitment to pottery, archery, animal husbandry, and gardening. Should trades/profession fail, the kids can always come home to pursue pottery, archery, animal husbandry, and gardening. Again, does this sound about right for now or am I being too sanguine?<br><br><a href=the-era-of-dissolution.html#c4502251994570168084 title="comment permalink">6/10/15, 10:47 PM</a><br><br>

I am going to suggest a set of rules that I think such a community would have to follow. I hasten to say that I do not understand these rules as predictions; I am not interested in foretelling the future. If these rules have any validity, it is because they apply now.<br><br>Supposing that the members of a local community wanted their community to cohere, to flourish, and to last, they would:<br><br>* Ask of any proposed change or innovation: What will this do to our community? How will this affect our common wealth?<br>* Include local nature -- the land, the water, the air, the native creatures -- within the membership of the community.<br>* Ask how local needs might be supplied from local sources, including the mutual help of neighbors.<br>* Supply local needs first (and only then think of exporting their products, first to near by cities, and then to others).<br>* Understand the ultimate unsoundness of the industrial doctrine of "labor saving" if that implies poor work, unemployment, or any other kind of pollution or contamination.<br>* Develop properly scaled value-adding industries for local products in order not to become merely a colony of the national or the global economy.<br>* Develop small-scale industries and businesses to support the local farm or forestry economy.<br>* Strive to produce as much of their own energy as possible.<br>* Strive to increase earnings (in whatever form) within the community, and decrease expenditures outside the community.<br>* Circulate money within the local economy for as long as possible before paying it out.<br>* Invest in the community to maintain its properties, keep it clean (without dirtying some other place), care for its old people, and teach its children.<br>* Arrange for the old and the young to take care of one another, eliminating institutionalized "child care" and "homes for the aged." The young must learn from the old, not necessarily and not always in school; the community knows and remembers itself by the association of old and young.<br>* Account for costs that are now conventionally hidden or "externalized." Whenever possible they must be debited against monetary income.<br>* Look into the possible uses of local currency, community-funded loan programs, systems of barter, and the like.<br>* Be aware of the economic value of neighborliness -- as help, insurance, and so on. They must realize that in our time the costs of living are greatly increased by the loss of neighborhood, leaving people to face their calamities alone.<br>Be acquainted with, and complexly connected with, community-minded people in nearby towns and cities.<br>* Cultivate urban consumers loyal to local products to build a sustainable rural economy, which will always be more cooperative than competitive.<br><br><a href=the-era-of-dissolution.html#c1353684959728591403 title="comment permalink">6/11/15, 1:37 AM</a><br><br>

I particularly enjoy these sequences of posts explaining the narrative and logic of collapse in various stages - it takes a chaotic and confusing process and explains it clearly. But stepping back into my day to day reality after reading I'm right back in the chaos and confusion. <br><br>I still have one last toe in the waters of mainstream business life and was last night at a dinner with some healthcare industry execs for an IT project I'm working on. The collapse-related data point I took away is that there is strong awareness by these movers and shakers that the current system is deeply unsustainable and can't be reformed; but they retain deep confidence in their ability to keep it all going in some way and to continue their careers anyway. It doesn't add up, but I see this time and time again- people who know abstractly that something is unsustainable, but nevertheless continue to act like it can be sustained. Very few seem to exit the stage in advance of the curtain coming down.<br><br>It seems easier for people to react to specific situations (eg. I lost my job or home, and now face a real personal collapse) rather than trying to anticipate in advance what collapse could look like and trying to position for it. The latter takes imagination and the willingness to risk stepping out and being wrong about the details. I've already made a series of errors, since I became "collapse aware", in terms of how I thought it would all play out. And it does make one feel a bit silly sometimes. So I do have sympathy with people who can see the storm coming but won't take shelter until it actually hits. Building useful skills may be the best thing to do - even if you decide not to change your life much until you have to, just knowing how to, say, garden at scale, will be very helpful once you actually have to react to collapse in the particular.<br><br><a href=the-era-of-dissolution.html#c6887330977229379416 title="comment permalink">6/11/15, 2:30 AM</a><br><br>

Even W Europe / EU must import the large part of primary protein, mostly Soya.<br> <br>Like many others I puzzle what to do <b>now</b> for children and grandchildren, (and for a worthwhile role and activity for myself) and employment is of central importance because of the need to access money, let alone a job worth doing.

I have several plan B professions bubbling in the background, and I am working to develop more awareness on dependency chains for the technologies we count on now. On a related note, I'm someone who's always lived near big cities (and my wife in big cities), and so although I've flirted with moving to the countryside, it's not in our plans. So I'm looking at how I can "make a go of it" while living in a major metropolitan area. Maybe I'm deluding myself? But I figure that large cities have been around for a long time, and so although things will get hard, there must be some way for me to make a living here, come what will.<br><br><a href=the-era-of-dissolution.html#c243826982129094730 title="comment permalink">6/11/15, 8:16 AM</a><br><br>

I responded, "Well, he's kinda like Gandalf, some would probably call him Gandalf Stormcrow - like Grima Wormtongue - but he tends to show up regularly when help is needed most." I think the wizardly comparison fairly apropos. <br><br>In continuing the Tolkien theme, I seem to recall how Tolkien felt that the greatest evil was the internal combustion engine. He saw industrialization dehumanizing, and made a number of comparisons between the orcs of Middle-earth and the industrial efforts of the day. <br><br>I teach junior high English in a inner-city school in Alberta. One of my greatest hopes mingled with some despair is the fate of many of the students I teach. They are being raised in first generation immigrant homes in hopes of grabbing part of the prosperity industrial Alberta has provided so richly for so long. Ironically, many of them are part of the first small waves of migrants - Chaldean Catholics by way of Syria, Eritreans from 20 year refugee camps, Sudanese boy soldiers, Filipinos, and many from Latin America (often economic refugees with ties to oil companies). I hope for a transition (or simply enough time) for many of these students to adjust to the new realities marching upon us. <br><br>On the other hand, in contrast of many of the harshest critiques of the province, Albertans have a very good history of banding together during tough times. We had a 100 year flood two years ago that had neighbor helping neighbor, and uniting the city behind a progressive mayor with a muslim background. And, there is a general blue-collar attitude of "git 'er done" that is more in tune with Midwest attitudes than "Texas North". These will provide some countervailing force.<br><br><a href=the-era-of-dissolution.html#c6973718305664643307 title="comment permalink">6/11/15, 8:26 AM</a><br><br>

I realize last week's comments discussed the pros and cons of sending one's child to college here in the states. The comments were broad and varied and generally quite helpful. I am still of a mind to send them to college, but only under a full or nearly-full scholarship and under no circumstances will any debt be incurred. If it can't be done very cheaply, they'll have to do something else. I've even thought about advising them to sign up for a branch of the military in order to use the GI Bill, but with the hot wars that are going on now, the chances they'll be put in harm's way soon are a bit too high for my risk-tolerance level.<br><br>As far as my own legacy, I am taking advantage of the fact that I'm at the tail-end of being a boomer and making a decent living. 13 years to go to pay off the house and 6 or so to pay off the 30 acres of timber property. I hope to leave a viable homestead free and clear to my kids, already up and running where they can simply take over the gardening and chicken coop. I've also offered to deed them each a 5 acre parcel from the 30 acres gratis. Then they can build small, energy-efficient homes which they can pay off in 10 years or less.<br><br>We're all in a collapse-now mindset, and frankly, we enjoy it much more than the BAU mindset. We all participate in producing food and doing repairs on the house and other chores, such as cleaning out the chicken coop and keeping them fed. A fast collapse may do us in as we have some armament and less than 1000 rounds of ammo, but our neighborhood is protectable with some cooperation. A slow collapse would fit much better with my plan, but as you say, none of us knows how or how fast it will all happen, only that it will.<br><br><a href=the-era-of-dissolution.html#c9082192505974597535 title="comment permalink">6/11/15, 9:52 AM</a><br><br>

When is was clear Jews in Germany were being targeted by the Nazis, only those with the resources (read money and connections) and wit (read knowledge and the will to apply it) were able to get out of harms way by emigrating. Similarly, as the Nazis approached Leningrad, only those with the resources and wit were able to leave the city before the siege began. Most people were tied to their location and circumstances by the simple need to get by. If wit is all you had/have, there were still things to do that might increase your chances of survival but your chances were/are still slim nonetheless. <br><br>This suggests a strategy a commenter remarked on some time ago: double down on your commitment to the system and do your best to ride it out. This may work if you are already well placed close to the sources of wealth and are strategic in your thinking of what part of the economy has some legs. So if you own business enterprises that are truly vital to the system, you may be best advised to stay the course. Similarly, I've seen people in a corporate environment who decided to place themselves more in the core part of the enterprise to avoid being laid off during a coming downturn.<br><br>Basically, if you are in, but have not built a war chest, get further in if for no other reason than to acquire the resources to “emigrate”. If you are out already, and getting in seem highly unlikely, all you have left is to make your own arrangements on the outside with what resources you already have. <br><br>The best case may be to play both games at once if possible. This is only really possible for those of largely “independent” means (i.e. reasonably assured income stream in the short term with little demands on their time and energy to maintain this stream). In most cases this means early retirees capable directing their resources and remaining energy to build an alternative life “outside” (i.e. “less dependent on”) a system that is failing. <br><br>Clearly, no one strategy fits all cases.<br><br><a href=the-era-of-dissolution.html#c1260708858407440759 title="comment permalink">6/11/15, 10:03 AM</a><br><br>

The Protectorate sounds a lot like a Breakdown era: Charles I's head has been removed, the monarchy abolished and England is under Lord Protector Cromwell (he's your talented despot). The end of Cromwell's Protectorate was followed by the Restoration of Charles II (son of Charles I who'd lost the Civil War and been executed). Charles II of England sounds quite a lot like Charles X of France in that they were both aware they were there on sufferance and managed to die of natural causes while still on the throne, but their successors weren't so careful and were removed. <br><br>In James II's case it was related to his religious choices (he was a catholic), and William of Orange and Mary were invited to take up the English throne, James fleeing. Due to the lack of deaths, this is sometimes called the glorious revolution.<br><br><a href=the-era-of-dissolution.html#c8801256363381304448 title="comment permalink">6/11/15, 10:11 AM</a><br><br>

A disagreement with a couple of my friends as to where Linus lived in Portland as a child brought on this bit of historical research on my part. What struck me about the early life of this great scientist and his family ( he was born in 1900) was the very unsettled and mobile life of his family in the early years of the new century. Moving from one place to another in the state for job opportunities, business failures, fires, living with relatives and unexpected deaths seemed to mark his childhood. <br> If the technological period around 1900 is our first destination after the first or second stairsteps of collapse then this is what awaits us in the future. Among the other fantasies that many of us have about the future of collapse, one of them might be that we are going to hunker down and ride it out in our stable homestead with family and freinds surrounding us. But this may not be realistic for more than a few and perhaps the future we must be prepared for is one of movement, change, adaptation and recovery from one failure after another. In addition to downscaling our living standards to beat the rush later perhaps we would also be advised to work on our adaptability and resiliance. Even though a carefull reading of JMG's work warns us that we must be prepared for such a future, most of us raised in the paradigm of industrial civilization tend to aim our preparedness towards aquiring material goods and land even if they are canning jars and garden plots instead of guns and barbed wire. But if history is any kind of a roadmap perhaps the ability to abandon your home and move on with nothing but your skills and a few tools or books on your back is the best adaptation. Perhaps the other take away from this small window in to the past is that we should also nuture a dispursed network of friends, family , and allies that we can trust and fall back on when we need a place to stay after our home is burnt down by the local warband.<br><br><a href=the-era-of-dissolution.html#c8562830853832521912 title="comment permalink">6/11/15, 10:52 AM</a><br><br>

The worst situation, in my opinion, is to be working long hours in multiple low paying jobs, trying to keep a last desperate foothold in a modern life. Sometimes it's better to just let go.<br>K-dog alluded to this: "but with limited options and desperate circumstances taking time and effort to get out of the way of the thundering storm of chaos and collapse on the horizon may be impossible."<br>It may be impossible because trying too hard to "make it" in a sinking economy leaves no time to think about the big picture, to read, to network and come up with alternatives. In trying to win today's battle, you lose the war. <br>I think there are millions of people trapped in this cycle of futility, of working too much to leave any productive time for themselves. They pour their energy into jobs that just suck the life right out of them, leaving them depressed and uninformed, and therefore even more ripe for exploitation.<br>So maybe there's another category of response to collapse: those who know their own place in the economy is collapsed but have nothing in their experience to suggest alternatives.<br>The people I know who have found some success, some quality of life outside the traditional economy, or on the edges of it, had the advantage of knowing a different way of life in their past, something beyond just having a job. They are already inured to the ideal of upward mobility and spent their lives learning trades, foraging, gardening, the things you can do for cash and barter. My own background of making up my own "career" instead of any traditional career puts me in this camp. So far, I've ridden the decline with a life that is interesting. I don't know about my future and am not implying that I have the answer. I just think that having the space to think and really talk to others about our conditions is crucial, and too many people don't have this time.<br>There is a lot of mythology that persists past its expiration date, about the work ethic in a purely exploitative economy. According to this thinking, the answer is always to work more, and it is sad to me when people trap themselves in this cycle.<br>I have a friend who works two jobs that both involve a lot of driving and working seven days a week. I am trying to convince her to quit both jobs, move to my small, walkable city which is cheaper, get rid of her car and all those expenses, and get by on one crappy job. Then she could take care of her mental and physical health.

I have no intention of quitting my job to collapse. I collapse on nights and weekends.

There is room for optimism in most models of change and we need to find it. Our 'collapse fantasies' are obstacles to genuine optimism.

One assumption this blog seems to make is that the machine age will disappear with the energy base that it rests upon. I'm not convinced that this is a good assumption. While it is true that the increasing scarcity of cheap and abundant energy will bring dramatic changes, the chances that it results in a return to the horse and cart is pretty slim.<br>Machines, especially prime movers, represent too much advantage. <br><br>There is a middle ground for machines and technology, however narrow, between the eternal progress myths and the doomed to the dark ages fears. It likely rests on the materials of the 19th century and the knowledge of the 20th. Examples abound but I'm primarily promoting a frame of mind here.<br><br>Perhaps one optimistic approach to an age of decline is to think in terms of an 'appropriate technology' movement geared to 'adapt now to avoid the rush'.

I'm seeing civilizations more and more as (to borrow another phrase from you) merely stories we tell ourselves about who we are, but with a lot of concrete props and dramatic enactments . . .<br><br>I really appreciated your explanation that "the breakdown . . . eliminate[s] enough of the existing order of things that the problems being caused by that order decline to a manageable level." This is, then, the narrative piece that matches, in the equation from "How Civilizations Fail," nC(p)&lt;M(p); the result is the conversion of capital to waste until (or unless) the remaining capital can actually be maintained by the resources available? And the further implication is that our current civilization is running the second of the two scenarios you illustrate in that essay, in which the demand for capital increases as supply falls *and* "C(p) tends to decrease faster than M(p)," resulting in the onset of a catabolic cycle? I'm not good with equations, and I'm worse at explaining them to others--but if this is even close to correct I'd appreciate knowing!<br><br><a href=the-era-of-dissolution.html#c8101914562535723823 title="comment permalink">6/11/15, 1:26 PM</a><br><br>

I'm the administrative head and chief bottle-washer for one of the dozen or so Druid orders in this country (and not the largest of them, by a long shot). As for whether I expect people to embrace Druidry -- well, it's been my repeated experience that nobody ever converts to Druidry; what happens is that people find out about it, do some reading, and say, "You know, that's kind of what I've believed all along, I just didn't have a name for it. I guess I might be a Druid." <br><br>Cherokee, exactly -- and none of us knows which way the boulder will bounce anyway. All we can do is try to get ready for as many possibilities as we can. <br><br>Ben, well, in my novel <i>Star's Reach</i>, set in a postcollapse 25th century, the more or less hereditary monarch of what amounts to the Midwest and shallow South (the deep South being deep underwater due to rising sea levels) is called the Presden of Meriga...<br><br>Zoroaster, as I noted in the post, there are various kinds of dissolution, thus various mottoes. In 1934-40 America it was "things will get back to normal someday soon," in 1815-30 France it was "everything's back to normal," and there are other variations. <br><br>K-dog, of course it's going to be messy. The point is that even as collapse happens -- and it's happening to a great many people in the US right now, of course -- there are more and less adaptive ways to cope, and for those who haven't arrived at that point yet, there's much that can still be done. <br><br>Jo, that's an excellent strategy -- I may quote you in an upcoming post, in fact. <br><br>Fudoshin, intellectuals in power are generally the worst sort of tin-pot despot. The kind of influence I want to wield is the kind that successful thinkers wield at their best: helping to define the terms of the collective conversation within which more practical people -- despots and others -- make their decisions. <br><br>John, that's an excellent point, of course. <br><br>Agent, excellent. Yes, these are all important issues, and there's no simple answer. I'd encourage you to make sure you have a few <i>very</i> basic skills -- for example, the ability to light a fire without matches, knowledge of makeshift shelters, etc. -- in case the bottom drops out completely in your area. After that, you choose whatever level you think is most likely to happen in your lifetime, and focus on that. Dissensus rules here as usual -- the more people choose different options, the wider the range of potentials for which there's some preparation on a collective level. <br><br>Omerori, thanks for the data point!<br><br>Ares, well, yes. Do you remember the posts I wrote a while back about how religion is the one reliable organizing force in a time of collapse?

But that silence is not so much an absence as it is the kind of deafening silence, when you notice that there are no sounds around you because the missing something is impossible to ignore any longer.<br>In other words, I feel it is weighing on everybody's minds, though most of us, even among the privilieged upper-middle class, are too busy pushing our daily cart forward to verbalize the big picture.<br><br>Maybe it is because we bathe in a culture which is less narrative than, say, the USA or England, and therefore we will not perceive the narratives described in this blog but rather a set of abstract problems (in economics, science and geopolitics).<br>It also has to do with the group behavior of humans : just like dogs, who act in sharply different ways between when alone and when in a pack, I feel that our individual worldviews do change when we are functionning in a group, like the office canteen or at a family dinner.<br>I am getting the feeling that when you talk to another person privately, it wouldn't be so difficult to corner her into accepting the concepts depicted in this blog, whereas not one person in their right mind would publicly acknowledge it.<br><br>So there we are, our feet deep in the mud of the Era of Pretense. Still, the generation of my parents has seen the last decades when a small provincial town would host a farmer's market with oxen-pulled carts. Hence it is yet another unmentionable of my times, that people would readily revert to a lower complexity lifestyle and it wouldn't be such a big deal. People are claiming the opposite in society, but in the case of France, I don't think the unspoken promise is just wishful thinking, we are still living under the great shadow of two world wars and the practical realities of collapse are not that hard to envision.<br><br>My guess is that there may not be an Era of Impact, just that everyone keeps worrying more and more about the future and each passing cycle of crisis will make it harder to conceal. And the use of Internet-based social media like blogs or meetups is one example of catabolic collapse : we use very complex technologies in order to plan for reverting to a set of much more simple tools and skills.<br><br><a href=the-era-of-dissolution.html#c737318251478437866 title="comment permalink">6/11/15, 2:29 PM</a><br><br>

Yes, that would follow, wouldn't it?<br><br>Joseph, Paul, Shhh, Jonathan, and Steve, yes, I saw that. It's typical that these days the Onion has the news and the mainstream news venues offer hilarious parodies.<br><br>Andy, that was C. Wright Mills' definition of "fate," too. <br><br>Phil, importing necessities while exporting jobs -- hmm. How could anything ever go wrong with that? <br><br>Dave, thanks for the data point. <br><br>Marc, good, but look at the bizarre phrase you've used for the process: "lose our connection with our future." What on earth does that mean? I don't ask that rhetorically -- what "future" are we connected with via global media, which after all only shows us a sanitized, digitized, and processed vision of small portions of the present? <br><br>Paul, it's good advice. <br><br>Dammerung, you really need to lay off the Austrian theory and get our more. Sure, in theory, every job that's taken away by automation frees someone to do something else; in the real world, by contrast, since the people thus laid off have only such access to capital and education as benefits the already wealthy, the only thing they're actually free to do, in most cases, is to stand in unemployment lines or starve in the gutter. By the way, shouting "Keynesian! Keynesian!" at the top of your lungs only impresses those who share your economic theology; in the real world, as I pointed out in response to one of your earlier comments, all the problems you blame on Keynesian economics and fiat currency were just as bad in the last quarter of the 19th century, when the US had a strict gold standard and Keynes was still in school. <br><br>Paul, it amazes me that no matter how many times I can say that running off to the country is a bad idea for most people, people keep on thinking that I must be talking about running off to the country. That is to say, of course you can make appropriate preparations in an urban or suburban area, and there are real advantages to doing so-- as I've discussed at length in earlier posts. <br><br>Philip, I bet your winter weather reports are sometimes pretty bleak, too. I don't know that it would be any kind of advantage if the media in Alberta adopted a policy of never reporting on the approach of bad weather...<br><br>Avery, possibly, but it's also possible that the religion of progress could lose its grip on a fairly large fraction of the population without too much trouble, if things break the right way.

Missing out on some big numbers for the AODA, still quality over quantity might be a good thought at this time. It takes some doing to not use the inherently fearful aspects of our collective future as a scarecrow when it comes down to it. I have certainly used it as such from time to time, but I think less often as time rolls on.<br><br>I am tied to the local food people in this community pretty tightly, hoping some of the sharper ones from it manage to be movers or shakers in some useful sphere, might get a roll as an adviser if the dice land box cars. Been questioning folks about adult education recently, feeling out what a niche might look like, and making other moves, trying to get positioned for the breaking of higher education. Lot's of folks could use a good education once their belief that they are educated, instilled by the University, gets measured against reality. <br><br>Right now I ain't too concerned about survival in a personal sense, too proud for that to be primary still... wonder how the shelf life on that pride is? Ain't got any kids, nor a wife to worry about, so I can afford it too. Here in Fort Collins there is some very good stuff happening in the local food movement, a lot of mindful people all knowing each other; and then there's the dozen myriad of 'wealthy refugees' who you don't see do much but eat, shop, and run or bike up and down steep things; each done in the most expensive way possible. If I were worried purely about survival I might, just might, be putting my eggs into the 'Lot' strategy, because I fear that this place could get very ugly having so far to fall, and such a large population of people who have never been poverty tested. Enough resources to fight over too, and deeply devided subcultures who currently do a good job pretending that each other simply aren't here. But I mentioned the local food movement here, and I think that I might be able to make a difference in that system. Take this farm (please!) its a good farm, the owners have deep roots in town, and we got some fine crops coming up, but there are also many forces and patterns present here which makes its survival far from certain if a crisis disrupts this region. I wish I were a mature Green Wizard, there would be something I could say about that stuff then, but as it stands my projects go up in smoke too often for my liking, and I struggle to put in as many hours in the fields I love as my friends succeed in putting into the jobs they hate. Isn't that weird? It ain't that I am lazy, I do work hard, but frustratingly I am too poor to work that long, I don't yet have the skills or the facilities to stay functional for full time field work. Just taking care of myself in my jankey farm camp is about full time, and alot of that is really dealing with loneliness of being the only human livestock on the farm. I choose that term for myself, livestock, 'consider the draft horse, he does not go to music shows nor drink craft brews, and yet is he not eager to work the land?' I have all the things a beloved livestock would need, and I want to learn that that should be enough, and to work with the strength of a ape and the sharpest wits I can hone. Still, don't you animal keepers know, never get just one of a herd animal? I wish those who have gifted me with meaningful work and the provisions to take to it would only gift another likewise.... HA well look at me ranting, guess I had something on my chest.

This seems to fit, as it is not a revolution (but some will occur), and it is not blanket dystopia (but there will be some) and it is not Mad Max, but that could happen in places for a time as well. What is happening is systematic breakdown of some very complex systems, and the knock-on effects are highly unpredictable. <br><br>Resource limits, population limits, governmental limits - everything is hitting against the edges of the petri dish, albeit some harder than others. Forget globalism - it is inherently doomed and a distraction. Corporations? Not with folks (consumers-yech) poor from wealth concentration - distraction too. We are at the point of waiting for the actual events and ramifications, as the multiple collapses are baked in already.<br><br>I think preparing is very much mental, and letting go of your present is very hard to do, but necessary to embrace a new future. You have to stop watching the train wreck and start making something new. Physically, the rules are the same - water, food, shelter - and then you are picking electives. Once you have a plan for the core curriculum, then you go for electives.<br><br>Humans have extreme difficulties with time - especially today when everything is instant. Things may happen quickly in a few locations, but this will literally take decades and generations. The inertia of what exists has to cease before change is preferred over clinging to an eroding status quo. Pain has to increase before humans can let go of the illusion of stability and seek new things. Everything unwinds at its own rate and with its own consequences - but the core requirements remain the same - water, food, shelter, same as ever.<br><br>It is this time-sense thing that makes it hard to collapse now, because all is slow motion. Tin-foil-hatters might make great friends, as we are trying to let go and just move on. Electives ought to be things of consequence for future generations - to enable the next climb up to be faster and sustainable. Just holding on to the concept of sustainability, even couched in a new-fangled religion or religious context, may be helpful. The younger bunch feels and senses it coming - and many are actually excited. Collapsing now feels better than waiting to see what happens next in DC or with the Kardashians...<br><br><a href=the-era-of-dissolution.html#c6633631194411571556 title="comment permalink">6/11/15, 5:51 PM</a><br><br>

I was lucky enough to go with my partner who grew up on a rural farm in Sichuan about 2 hours drive from Zigong. We spent a week in the area and I think some of the commentary speaks to your recent series.<br><br>The family farm was a government decision for her parents - they were forced to settle there in the late 60's. The basic instruction was "grow enough food to support your family; any extra is your income." The fields had to be cleared and the house if made from bricks that were hand-made from the red clay soil that is so common.<br><br>I wonder what the reaction in NA would be if people were similarly instructed by the government?<br><br>He father and mother retired to the city (in a condo bought by my partner) 6 years ago. However, family and friends still live and work there. Most people in the area are at least in their late 60's up to early 80's. But they were very gracious to invite us to their front porch to enjoy beer and home-made treats. They were proud to show us their fields (which are probably 2-3 acres per household not including rice paddy) which are planted using some of the latest techniques such as plastic to keep weeds away and moisture in the ground. The 80 year old spent a lot of time showing us his 5 piglets which are raised for extra cash.<br><br>These people are so happy but still, they are now surrounded by abandoned farms. There are no young people to be seen...<br><br>However, my partners peers are certainly interesting. One, a very successful stock broker, kept saying "I just want to lose it all and go back to the family farm. That work means something."<br><br>I think China will need to send young people back to the farms just as they did during the cultural revolution. This area is a bread basket for China and is not landscape that can be factory farmed. So China may be a bellwether for the changes to come here - I think that they will react much sooner than the decaying structure here.<br><br>But the transition may not be that difficult for them. Interesting times, no doubt...<br><br><a href=the-era-of-dissolution.html#c2113496847833791020 title="comment permalink">6/11/15, 6:14 PM</a><br><br>

The fall of Rome was driven in part by "peak slavery," and many agrarian civilizations have collapsed because their main energy source -- grain used to fuel human and animal muscle -- stopped being cheap and plentiful due to topsoil loss. As for 90%, that seems optimistic to me; I expect roughly a 95% decline over the next two to three centuries, as I've noted here before. <br><br>Wizzard, good. I hope more people start thinking "what a waste" when they see the latest frantic attempts at sustaining the unsustainable. <br><br>Denys, it's by no means certain the jackboots and armbands will end up in power; what's certain, I think, is that people will flock to some similar source of easy answers as things tighten up. <br><br>Zentao, fascinating.

If you follow your genetic and ancestral imperatives, you should be actively finding your own way forward. Not necessarily for yourself as much as for your children, grands and beyond. If the population declines by 95%, I certainly think my genes should move forward (I am a tad biased, after all...)<br><br>We are looking at a world where there is a quadrillion bucks of debt floating around, nuclear weapons, weaponized viruses, 7 billion people and insufficient resources for the population to remain static. Sure - you can avoid having kids, but it flies in the face of what we are. It will be a competition - it is the nature of life. Bend or break, adapt or die. Foregoing procreation is not a survival strategy - look at every other life form on the planet.<br><br>As a father and grandfather, it is my DUTY and privilege to try and help my family. Letting them be blindsided by this, stick their head in the sand or other forms of ignorance to our situational environment should not even be on the table. There is a window of relative stability that is closing in these next few years and we should all be taking advantage of what we know, resources we currently have and all our learning.<br><br>If nothing else, a library of last century technical books printed on acid-free paper would be a giant step for any family in 200 years. And then you have to make the library to save it in, and it has to be made of stone, dry, bug free.... Things can be done now, and you simply need to believe in your own view of the future. We are all talking about 'common sense' here - the key word being common, because we all realize what the inevitable is or we would not be on your site. We may not all see the same demon, but we all see the dark shapes looming in our future.<br><br>Fight or flight are natural - rolling over and exposing your throat is a learned behavior. Sorry if anyone finds this offensive, but things are not as gray or complex as many seem to think. The primary problem is that change is terrifying to most people, as they have avidly avoided it their entire lives...<br><br><a href=the-era-of-dissolution.html#c6724570729814356418 title="comment permalink">6/11/15, 9:17 PM</a><br><br>

The dilemma has resulted in a tendency to devolve into self-absorbed rants after reading your posts, which I'm grateful keep me thinking over how to respond to the situation, in my own way.<br><br>I don't think I am ever going to create my own farmstead or home economy (half of this is personal proclivity, half resource access - much of which is human!), but I might be looking into how to join one some day in the future and the prospect is daunting, given I feel like a stranger everywhere. <br><br>I do wonder how much of the "population bust", as you term it, will be due to suicide, drug abuse, and murder. Suicide and murder have always been around, but designer drugs are a most troubling prospect, as can be inferred from the situation in Russia with "krokodil": how many people already dealing with substance abuse problems (or never thought about it before? :() will resort to these kinds of "cheap high" poisons once economic crisis hits their part of the world. If you haven't heard of krokodil, look it up, it was introduced to poor heroin addicts - is apparently insane in its addictive power, and gives users a life expectancy of 1-3 years. It's already been found detecting spreading rapidly to other parts of the world. Imo, it makes meth look harmless. <br>One thing that can definitely be expected is for impoverished, extremely miserable masses to seek an escape of some kind. I don't think it will be easy to watch at all.<br><br><a href=the-era-of-dissolution.html#c5726499895064189363 title="comment permalink">6/11/15, 9:47 PM</a><br><br>

I have no words of wisdom about the future of dentistry, or, really, any of the themes discussed here, but do have a suggestion; next time, you might try eating oregano twice a day until you can get to the dentist. It's a powerful antibiotic, according to a study by Cornell University. This spring, I used it to reduce my husband's pain from a tooth abscess to a bearable level, until he could get a root canal done. We used fresh, but I don't think it matters if all you have is dried. Thyme is another alternative.<br>As for preparing, I don't know anyone, including spouse, who's on this boat with me -- though at least he does like doing things for ourselves. I just keep sharing extra vegetable starts, trying to get people to garden, cook and preserve, even if only on a very small scale, so they'll have at least a little practice at doing, and thinking about it. And trying to learn more myself. Currently struggling to figure out larger-scale gardening. Farming, and presumably gardening, cause desertification, over some millennia. Permaculturists argue that keeping the ground in green mulch helps prevent that. In Cascadia, green mulch is a welcome mat to slugs and voles. So is any other cover, such as straw, assuming you can even get your hands on organic straw. The main alternatives I've seen suggested are dust mulch (isn't that a contradiction in terms? But it works! At least for deterring those particular pests. And for dryland growing), and plastic "mulch" -- gah. Gardening is one darn thing after another, too. But at least you get to eat some of the things. I do want to run off to a farm, mostly because I grew up on one and miss it. But the finding is proving tough.<br> Back to trying to figure out what I'm doing...<br><br><a href=the-era-of-dissolution.html#c8495695985987232255 title="comment permalink">6/11/15, 10:15 PM</a><br><br>

I've been living in China for almost five years now and I would say that lifestyle in Chinese cities is not that different than in America and most other Western countries, with the number of cars on the road increasing daily, and a large populous of people glued to and hugely influenced by electronic entertainment. <br><br>The 1960s Cultural Revolution was riding on the coattails of a big change in China after decades of fighting which had left people unsure about their futures, and not with luxuriant lifestyles. Forcing people onto farms where they could ensure food would be put into their mouths was probably something many were willing to do.<br><br>Move forward to the future now, where many of the young kids I teach call each other farmers as if it is an insulting term, and one realizes that forcing them back to a lifestyle that their families lived 3 or 4 generations ago would result in uprising. Most young people don't know how to farm, and most young people would rather lounge about their parents house until they get the opportunity for a white collar job. <br><br>A few weeks ago a lot of discussion in the comments was on revolution. From some reading I did because of the discussion, and probably as noted elsewhere on this blog or in the comments, one of the precursors to a revolution, in the East or the West, is to force a drastic change in lifestyle on a people. China, like the USA, would likely face revolution if the young were enslaved into farm labor like your wife's family were, until such a time as living conditions make working a farm look appealing.<br><br><a href=the-era-of-dissolution.html#c4522137663186006387 title="comment permalink">6/12/15, 12:22 AM</a><br><br>

It's happening in Greece, in Spain and, funnily enough, in the UK but for reasons that are totally different.<br><br>The eurozone is going to be torn apart soon. Even some of the most zealot of the proponents of the EU integration talk openly about the exit of Greece from the eurozone. This event would start a political withdrawal from other countries like Spain and maybe Italy and France.<br><br>There is a lot of mutual mistrust between the elites and the people. I'm not teaching you anything there :) But it has been put up to eleven by now. <br>For instance, more than 75% of the French distrust the President of the Republic and agree he's incompetent. Although the Prime Minister remains quite popular for now. Some bills have been passed about overall state security by data interception and analysis. This is the French NSA to make it short.

I was of the same opinion as Paul a few years ago and even stopped reading your blog! I started reading again mid-last year or so and I was able to understand what you were saying. My husband can’t understand why I went back to reading your blog and why it seems so influential for me (along with the commenters). I told him – when you read the blog, you read with what you bring with you. It’s like I couldn’t read your blog without putting a subconscious sheen over everything and therefore not understanding what you really were saying.

I’m very grateful for that!<br><br>Also on your comment about Druidry not being something you convert to, yes, that seems very true for me. When I tell close friends about my practice of Druidry, I say, I’m studying Druidry. For me it’s like saying, I’m studying the world around me and within me. How does one convert to that?

I am guilty of some amount of collapse wish fulfillment. As an urban cyclist I definetly hope ( realistic or not) that the next stage of collapse will drastically slim the heard of fossil fuel and battery driven motorist on the streets. Like any cyclists I have had my share of run-ins with careless, incompetent or malicious drivers and much of this is wish fullfilment. A recent crosswalk sting by Portland Police supports my opinion of car drivers and perhaps shows we are further down the road to collapse than many think. In a 4 hour period they issued the following citations ( in a middle class area too).<br><br>– 18 Failure to stop and remain stopped for a pedestrian<br>– 14 Operating a vehicle while using a mobile communication device<br>– 7 Passing a stopped vehicle at a marked crosswalk<br>– 2 DWS [Driving While Suspended] (violation)<br>– 1 DWS (Misdemeanor)<br>– 1 Careless Driving<br>– 2 Failure to obey a traffic control device,<br>– 3 No operator’s license<br>– 1 No proof of insurance<br>– 4 Driving uninsured<br>– 1 Failure to drive within lane<br>– 1 Operating without proper fenders or mudguards<br>– 1 Expired registration tags, 1 Obstruction of vehicle windows<br>– 1 Speeding<br>– 2 Failure to register vehicle<br>– 2 warnings<br><br>In addition ,my hope for the collapse of happy motoring is driven by my knowledge of climate change, impervious surface caused by roads and parking lots and the entire suite of externalities caused by the automobile. I realize that this next step down will cause untold hardship and may even claim me in the swirl of disease, famine, and violence that may ( or may not) accompany it. But I do try and put my emotional wish fulfilment on the back burner when making important decisions. At least mine is more realistic than those that hope that collapse will only effect those of the opposite ( fake) political party or racial group.<br><br><a href=the-era-of-dissolution.html#c8731653826189137124 title="comment permalink">6/12/15, 9:14 AM</a><br><br>

I'm not done yet, but recommend it as a historical analysis with relevance for modern and future times. Has anyone read this?<br><br>If not:<br>The Little Ice Age had civilization-altering effects. Parker gives a deeply and broadly comprehensive overview of a century full of climate-change-driven weather extremes (droughts, floods, extreme cold, failed harvests) and their results, including famine, disease, more wars and revolutions than in any historical period, and global depopulation by a third. He focuses on Europe, but includes Asia and Africa as well. The quotes he gives from people writing at the time are very affecting. <br><br>If a reader wants to know just how war, disease and famine cut birthrates; or how endless wars immiserated the villagers forced to give tribute and supply soldiers; or how the extreme pollution and crowding of London and other big cities turned them into population sinks dependent on constant in-migration for stable size; or how bad royal policy caused misery and upheaval--or any of a host of other relevant topics, such as what happens when the supply chains break down, it will be found in this large but quite readable volume.<br><br>One takeaway for now is that, as our host maintains, no matter where you are collapsing there will be misery, the politics will be dicey, and climate disruption and environmental degradation have vastly more power than our global civilization has yet faced up to. Yet, the total results were not entirely predictable--great art, music, writing, the beginning of the scientific method, a reconfiguration of the ideas of democracy and human rights all emerged out of the dreadful conditions.<br><br><a href=the-era-of-dissolution.html#c7625839316557102639 title="comment permalink">6/12/15, 9:52 AM</a><br><br>

This year is dry, one of the driest in the past few years. Smoke from forest fires in similarly dry British Columbia make a kinda of fog that can blot out the sun. Not much is made of climate change in the general media. Conservative heartland out here. But weather is a practical pastime, ironically. <br><br>Our winters are harsh, and where I grew up even harsher than in Calgary where I teach now. I can recall checking checking calves at night as a teenager in a February with -45 celsius (-50ish Fahrenheit) windchill. We have to check every hour when it's like that - the ears freeze off first, and sometimes the calves just don't get up. We'd put them in the barn with the heat lamp after we found them in the corrals. That was before my dad pushed the season the bulls were out to later in the year.<br><br>We experience more extremes in weather these years, from my lived experience and observation as a Millenial. In Calgary we say: "don't like the weather? Wait five minutes." <br><br>The farm is a marvel of light industrial technology, and I often think, when I'm not teaching in the city, about all the externalities and risk the farm is facing.

My father graduated from high school in 1929. The family had had a tough life and had knocked around in the teens and 1920's living, at one time, on a wheat ranch in Eastern Washington where the old man repaired equipment. It was not an easy time for the family and the 30's got even worse. There were many, many people out in the country side doing farming jobs because most farming was powered by animal and people power. Tractors and powered harvesters were just coming on.<br><br>To transition back to a more agrarian way of life from where we are today will be difficult for many to process. The mental and physical strain will be too great for many alive today who expect a life of middle class plenty forever.<br><br>Back then, at the Grange Social on Saturday night, hundreds would show up having walked for miles or having ridden in a wagon drawn by horses over unimproved dirt roads. Socializing off farm was special. People existed with few possessions and no coins in their pocket. The life in the country was hard and when my father graduated into a terrible job market he was prepared for continued hardship. The NW wheat ranches had hard working people, some recent immigrant families. That gave them a cultural model that went back to the beginning. Everyone was expected to work, which also meant growing extra garden food. Kids worked, did well in school and helped in the garden. Boys were expected to hunt and fish on the side for meat with whatever tools were at hand.<br><br>What we are approaching is a zeitgeist change where our present privileged attitudes will have to re-conform to a new reality. Our thought patterns cannot remain as they are now, in the present age of oil powered plenty, with our entrenched expectations of personal enrichment. Our inner dialog will have to change. We cannot demand to see someone in “customer service” when there is no food in the stores.<br><br>Dick Cheney said: “The American way of life in nonnegotiable,” when asked about getting by with less oil and trimming back. Yes, it will not be re-negotiated, our old way of life will be eliminated. Imagining the era of dissolution as a personal experience is hard to picture or anticipate. It can be likened to the difference between living on the streets forever instead of crashing at your folks for the night. A wet card board box instead of your parent's couch. The difference between a rock hard life and some easy mooching. So much of our cultural support system is going out of whack and incapable of helping people get by in desperate times, that a drastic attitude adjustment for all of us will be the first critical step.<br><br>The old wheat ranch ethic may slowly reemerge, but it will not be an automatic shift in values and attitude from today's “me” to tomorrow's “we.” People will have to work hard on it together as a community, in whatever location they find ourselves. We will have to reestablish sharing values and work with crowds of diverse strangers.<br><br>Imagine a future with acute food shortages, deep cold and no electricity, gas or fuel. Imagine limited health care. Most institutions will be over loaded and the economic system will not quickly adjust to the loss of our present forms of energy, money, society or employment. Even a return to the land will have high hurdles to scale. Widespread knowledge how to grow food has been lost along with much of the available, fertile earth close to urban areas. The way people relate to each other and how strangers work together on any team effort is dismal in our culture. <br><br>We are like a giant marching band that has never played together, doesn't know the tune and is out of step. Did I mention the horse patrol up ahead? Watch where you step. How we adapt and learn to work together will determine much of our happiness.<br><br>”Depend upon it, sir, when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully." – Samuel Johnson.<br><br><a href=the-era-of-dissolution.html#c8987092486286306360 title="comment permalink">6/12/15, 1:49 PM</a><br><br>

If you are averse to foul smells, hot entrails, calluses on your hands or sweating - then you might want to think about what you WOULD BE WILLING to do as the future becomes the present.<br><br>Most farmers would love to have a real hardware store or a local sawmill or a dry goods store within a half-day ride. But NONE of those exist today in the forms needed by farmers.

My partner introduced me to quite a number of her friends; they all met in university. Most grew up in the same environment that she did: on a farm out in rural areas (mostly Sichuan province). They all mentioned that they feel they are doing their kid (although one has two children) a disservice by not providing a solid foundation in very basic knowledge such as growing food. However, many also said that they are torn since they are presently sending kids to extra university tutoring all weekend and there is simply not enough time for teaching farming.<br><br>But at least they are thinking about it...<br><br>I was also lucky in the very candid nature of the discussion. Since they have known each other for so long they did hide commentary. Many mentioned that they are well aware of what their government does (hell, many regularly travel to NA and EU so they see things developing here) and that they all simply work around this. So much economy there is straight cash that it is very straight-forward to assist those who are friends with funds that are completely outside of government control.

I think there is still a lot of translatable and useful knowledge that we really don't want to lose, and that is not common knowledge to most of us today; mainly intricate understanding of how the systems of the body, (or in my immediate case the teeth and gums) are supposed to work, and what 'basically' needs to be done when they don't. <br><br>No doubt, there are a lot of high tech solutions today that simply won't be possible in a post-Industrial age. <br>OTOH: <br>Martin B's telling of the Ghanian dentist tapping the tooth open and filling it with gold flake is very heartening to me; as is N.

Not all, but a lot of vital things can and are being done without electric drills, x-rays and a distracting TV on the ceiling. <br><br>I've always been of the scavenger mind-set: I hate to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Don't like to throw the rubber ducky out either. Heck! Is that bathwater still warm? I can wash the dogs with it then sprinkle it on the plants!!<br><br>**What we'll really need is knowledge of medicinal herbs and plant properties, like the pre-christian witches and mid-wives, (and Druids?) to bridge the pharmaceutical gap.

From what I see here on the ground - the rapidity of growth and westernization / complexity has made a combination of completely willfully helpless, work-averse 'Little Emperors' and 'Little Empresses' and OTOH masses of people who will go through collapse largely untouched because they never got to go through the bubble to begin with! But most fascinatingly to me - SO many people I've seen and known who are a bizarre melding of the two. Beverly Hillbillies - Asian Edition. (I could provide volumes of crazy interesting anecdotal stories on this. (Although I'm not knocking them: I've also picked up a lot of great 'living with LESS' tips from people here, both rich and poor.)<br><br>Additionally, a draconian governmental body bent on controlling and shaping China's future as a whole, completely willing to steamroll individuals if need be; and an entrepreneurial and unruly populace that HAS never and WILL never trust them or behave and do as they are told, who will nod politely, then get around the rules if at all possible, (and it's quite often possible!). For most of it's history, China has not been an actually united country. Even under the heaviest oppressions of the communist party, (when it truly was communist), outer provinces were really run by local strong-arm authorities and the central communist government quietly accepted that as long as those local 'warlords' did not openly flout CCP official authority. They just took on the title of 'Mayor' or 'Provincial Governor' and kept on running the place as they had before.<br><br>"The mountains are high and the Emperor is far away".<br><br>On the issue of farming however: That IS very worrisome as historically, most provinces have never been great at sustaining their own populations. I don't know enough to speak authoritatively on it, but I've read in several sources that much of our land is simply not that arable. Can only hope that modern soil enrichment and best practice or permaculture farming techniques and knowledge can improve that. (?) Doubtful, eh? I really don't know.

Here's a take on the effect of automation that I don't see reflected in the usual debate. The usual debate seems to be between those who say that "automation produces miserable idleness in former workers" and those who say "automation frees workers for better happy labor". There is a third possibility. Since automation makes more goods for less labor, there will immediately be some labor displacement. But because there are more goods, the displaced labor (after a generation or two, perhaps) finds new jobs which enable them to acquire the cheaper goods. These new jobs may be in entirely new industries, such as the sport-industrial complex, or the available labor may expand old labor categories, such as retail sales (including prepared food, fast and slow). The problem, as I see it, is that secure occupations employ a shrinking fraction of the population. By "secure", I mean jobs which provide the necessities: staple foods, energy, and water. But the new occupations all support <b>discretionary</b> consumption, so these jobs can go to zero demand as quickly as consumer psychology turns against them. Civilization got along just fine without cable television (or its modern descendant: broadband Internet), and consumers could abandon them overnight. As long as there's enough production of necessities to go around, job-like ways will be found to control their allocation. But when the necessities get scarce, we'll find out which careers are discretionary.<br><br>Consumers can defer purchases of clothing, shelter, and transportation for a few months to years, but eventually the old necessities wear out and must be replaced.<br>Some level of financial services is probably necessary, but probably not CNBC. (That's cable TV cheerleading for the financial industry, for those who don't recognize the acronym.)<br><br>Sadly, most of the vendors that I see in our local "farmers' market" are discretionary: hand-thrown ceramics, wood craft, prepared food, decorative items. They're talented, local, earnest, and low-tech, but not necessarily resilient.<br><br><a href=the-era-of-dissolution.html#c6451495143502993397 title="comment permalink">6/12/15, 6:21 PM</a><br><br>

I grow a lot of shrubs which provide shelter and housing for the small birds here and they eat all manner of garden pests - in fact they do most of the pest control for me and spend all day everyday doing so. Slugs and snails escape from my worm farm sewage system all of the time, but they rarely make a living "on the run" because they get eaten. A build up of pests generally indicates a deficiency of predators and that is something you might want to think about addressing. Small birds often suffer horribly due to lack of habitat and shelter. People don't generally consider planting small dense shrubs because it takes up otherwise valuable garden space, but someone has to otherwise you end up living in an artificial environment. Any artificial environment ultimately takes more energy and resources to manage, but can have some serious advantages too.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=the-era-of-dissolution.html#c3512872076935994988 title="comment permalink">6/13/15, 3:39 AM</a><br><br>

And by the end of the 1970s there was only hers. Roads were good, gas was cheap and most people worked in town anyway, so there was no need for anything there except as a convenience store. Once they took the post office from the store, it was pretty much done. <br><br>But when roads aren't good, gas is expensive, and people are thrown back on their more local resources - then the person who can solve the problems of getting, transporting and marketing the things people require will play their role again.<br><br><a href=the-era-of-dissolution.html#c2148992798116970244 title="comment permalink">6/13/15, 4:53 AM</a><br><br>

But even a slowly reproducing species such as ours has its celibates and whatnot, who opted out early on for various reasons and devoted themselves to leaving legacies of different sorts. I have a cousin who was a Catholic nun, obviously never married, but now she has the time to write a family history. She is transmitting the knowledge of our family rather than the genes. Her genes (and mine for that matter) are well represented in dozens of other very nice people, some of whom have decided kids are right for them.

I have had clients send me extra money for doing a good job for them, but my bank has only offered me a toothy smile and a lime flavored tootsie-pop to hold my money while they lend it to others to make much more themselves.<br><br><a href=the-era-of-dissolution.html#c3974340056648659340 title="comment permalink">6/13/15, 3:51 PM</a><br><br>

Unfortunately the question becomes even harder to answer since there are several factors in play, all of which are moving (independently for some, and with co-dependence for others). <br><br>I'm guessing you pulled your 5% number, from share of the world's population that lives in the US (if not, please correct me). Not an unreasonable starting place, but in a collapse environment, the other components which will weigh in perhaps more so that relative population levels are: are those resources local or imported, what is the general world-wide (and local) level of available resources, what is the state of local economy, and what is the state of long distance transportation. No doubt there are other factors too.<br><br>Many possible answers as we bounce down the slope of de-industrialization. We could end up continuing to consuming 20-30% of the world's extracted resources in the future, but that level may well be 3-4% or less than what we have available now due to a global decline. Or we could bring our consumption in line with the size of our population, but that still does not guarantee sustainability, if the world as a whole is extracting at unrealistic levels. <br><br>Too many possibilities for an accurate prediction (IMO), other than to say most likely less than we have today. Perhaps too, one can likely bet that your standard of living will once again depend much more on the local resources (people, agricultural, mineral, energy, etc) available to you than on access to paper wealth, as it did for much of history before this recent era.<br><br><a href=the-era-of-dissolution.html#c3952173164803356465 title="comment permalink">6/13/15, 6:33 PM</a><br><br>

We have native slugs, but also a lot of imported ones; this region is slug heaven. Most people resort to hunting and killing them; I can't bear to, (terrific farmer material, yes?!) and we also object to the very-commonly-used slug bait. Some things do eat them, such as opossums, but due to our terrier, our yard is not a good place for opossums. I don't know whether any make it up from the river to the farm property I'm renting for the large garden; they'd have to get through various pastures, past various dogs.<br>There is a saying here; 'You don't have a slug excess; you have a duck deficiency.' Lol. I like it, but haven't so far been able to sell spouse on my need for ducks. Not for lack of trying! I hadn't thought about wild birds taking their place. <br>Our suburban back yard is in fact a small bird haven, which has not stopped it from also being a slug haven -- though I don't, here, tend to have things nearly as riddled with slug holes as the cabbage was; perhaps there's a connection here I hadn't seen. It should also be excellent garter snake territory, but I haven't been seeing nearly as many in recent years. I don't know if they're just hiding, or something has changed for them. <br>My new large garden, home of the slug-riddled cabbage, unfortunately, is, as mentioned, on someone else's land, so I don't have control over providing bird, snake and opossum habitat. Perhaps some more sunflowers, and some amaranth would help attract birds. <br>As for voles, well, for those there are dogs, which in my experience cause more damage than the things they're chasing, and raptors, for which you have to have tall trees or poles -- fine, again, if it's your own land.<br>But I've noticed that farmers and gardeners more experienced than I have the same problems with green cover. <br>All good things to consider for the future.<br><br><a href=the-era-of-dissolution.html#c454630523956198858 title="comment permalink">6/14/15, 2:14 PM</a><br><br>

In my novel, After the Last Day that covers the 60 years after a global ecomonic meltdown,I present a dentist in Port Huron Mich., nicknamed "Hambone". He was a Prof at the University of Michigan who fled internal conflict in the enclave of survivors at Ann Arbour. At Port Huron he set up a dental clinic in an abandoned muffler repair shop because, amongst other reasons, they had access to some solar PV that could power the air compressor. All of this will only be possible in the 'salvage phase' after any collapse. The sequel, that I am working on now, is set about a century later when most of the old salvaged technology has broken down. But, it will still be a world of uneven organisation with some small industrial enclaves struggling to live in a technical world surrounded by those learning to live on the natural loop.<br><br><a href=the-era-of-dissolution.html#c4576220718611274566 title="comment permalink">6/14/15, 5:06 PM</a><br><br>

This was caused by ore being dissolved in water and then concentrated when precipitated out in a large fracture cave. It reached critical mass and melted - sometime in the past - without any help from humans. There do exist ore bodies with 35-50% natural concentrations of U-238 (Cigar Lake is the most recent find).<br><br>My best guess is that, like Chernobyl and Fukushima, there will be contaminated zones where spent fuel rods are doing their "new natural" thing - cooling and releasing energy to revert to a stable state. As far as I am aware, current governments and powercos have NO plans in place that assume they cannot get fuel. They do not think in terms of societal or even supply chain collapse.<br><br>I do not know where the US stores spent fuel rods. If there is not a big cache of them in each power plant, then I agree there will be local hot spots eventually, if we have total systemic collapse. However, water tables are involved, and I have no idea about tritium concentrations and their effect on people drinking contaminated groundwater. The pile of a meltdown should stay in place, as the material is very dense and heavier than lead or tungsten. It is the water that concerns me, or airborne debris from explosive cooling as seen in both Chernobyl and Fukushima.<br><br>My solution was to go very far from any nuclear plant when buying my farm land. But again, this is unlikely to happen if there is a functioning government or MIC, even a local one.

From my vantage, if others don't elect to integrate this issue into their individual and collective plans and intents for humanity and the planet, then their models omit a key element. Perhaps my post was incomplete; decommissioning of nuclear across the planet must be priority one, if we seek to have any humans or other animals living on the planet in 100 years, or 1000. Many or most or all of the grids will go down at some stage and if the active nukes aren't cooled or the insufficiently packaged and stored nukes aren't mitigated, the contamination zones will be much more than 12 miles in most cases. The first action to be taken, the thing each may do, is admit the issue exists, because until there is a collective recognition, there will won't be political will power to press for solutions (as everyone kicks the can, screams not in my backyard to long term storage locations and generally worries more about coal plant pollution and fracking than they seem to about nuclear).<br><br><a href=the-era-of-dissolution.html#c270266726446469329 title="comment permalink">6/15/15, 7:17 AM</a><br><br>

The British army had intenive traning for its radio operators/repairmen. Everything from radio theory to working on almost every military radioset from the last 40 tears. They were taught how to re-wire and jury rig anything. As a result they could repair almost anything in the field given some wire and solder. Given three broken modern sets, they could make one operable one.<br><br>The US Army went another way. By the seventies, most recruits were not farm boys with lots of experience working on engines and vehicles. So all their extensive vehicle mechanic training revolved around a device called the low voltage circuit t6ester. But as I observed, most LVCT devices broke down quickly and you had whole motor pools where no one knew what to do, and vehicle parks full of non-functioning vechles (exacerbated by a complete inability to get spare parts). There was so much pressure from commanders to show operable vehicles, a bare chasis was called operable.<br><br>So, in a similar vein, go back to older, simpler tech (approprtiate tech), and you find low cost, easily fabricated solutions. For dentristy go back to pedal powered drills, for carpentry, check out the manual ways of "The Woodwright's Shop" (you do not need all those power tools they were shilling on "This Old House"). AS William Gibson says - basic tools will always be valuable.

When bombs and warheads are decommissioned, an international agency takes custody of the enriched uranium, mixes it with low grade uranium, and gives the resulting reactor fuel away to various countries. A lot of nuclear power plants are using the free fuel.<br><br>When that fuel runs out, there will be a financial incentive for nuclear armed countries to convert more bombs and warheads to reactor fuel, either openly or clandestinely. Maintaining nuclear weapons in working order costs money. As a deterrent, there is little practical difference between a hydrogen bomb that you suspect is a dud and an empty bomb casing. France has a lot of nuclear reactors and no uranium mines; I bet they will do it clandestinely.<br><br>During the Age of Scarcity I think most weaponized uranium will be converted into reactor fuel. Abandoned nuclear weapons stockpiles will be broken into by thieves, and in the process of extracting and transporting the uranium and plutonium, the chances of accidentally creating a critical mass are pretty high. If a stockpile is abandoned, the chances of containers and casings failing in ways that produce a critical mass are low but not zero; rising over time as more containers fall to bits, falling when all the vulnerable stockpiles have blown up and the rest of the fuel is no longer capable of sustaining a chain reaction. <br><br> There isn't much we can do about enriched plutonium except to stop making it.

Speaking as an electrical engineer, I can name a long and far-from-comprehensive list of failure mechanisms that are pretty much guaranteed to take out every computer in existence over a shorter timeframe than you probably imagine. Yes, of course, there is the failure of electrolytic capacitors due to drying-up of the electrolyte. Also, if they are not in constant use, they need to be carefully reformed before use. Tin whiskers grow all by themselves in modern electronic solder and eventually form shorts, especially with today's tiny geometries. Corrosion is an ever-present phenomenon. Any electronic device that stores its operating code in a semiconductor is subject to a long list of ways it can be corrupted, and that would include, um, well, anything with a microprocessor or flash memory, which is um, well, everything. Stray cosmic rays will scramble that code, same for random alpha, beta or gamma radiation...just one particle due to random atomic decay and its all over for your device. Flash memory can only be erased and rewritten a fixed number of times before it's useless, in fact some processors have an internal function to find and fix errors in the background when they are operating, and have a 1-2% chance per year of irretrievably corrupted code if they are turned off. Then there are things that hurt semiconductors when they are warm and operating like electromigration...And I haven't even gotten into mechanical wear on things like disk drives. <br><br>Trust me, the chance of having any computer 100 or 200 years from now that is still operational is pretty remote.

A capacitor is just two conductors separated by a thin layer of non-conductor. I've seen commercial capacitors which were little more than two strips of aluminum foil separated by two strips of waxed paper, wound together into a compact cylinder and dipped in wax to keep out the moisture. Aluminum foil, at some point, may be harder to get than gold foil, but either would work (or copper foil, though copper can corrode into a semiconductor, which would be bad in this application). Paper, beeswax... I think we're OK with those. Then, you need a way to reliably connect the foil layers to the wire leads to the rest of the circuit. We may be able to spot-weld the foil onto wire (as is done today) without too much energy, and salvage solder (lead and tin were used in ancient times).<br><br>But none of these improvised capacitors will provide the same performance in the same space as current products, so future equipment may be a lot less portable than we're used to.<br><br>Capacitors can also use air as the insulating layer, but then you may run into mechanical problems maintaining the proper spacing.<br><br><br><a href=the-era-of-dissolution.html#c2662007228178652691 title="comment permalink">6/16/15, 5:41 PM</a><br><br>

At an ancient univerity in England, there was an ancient, lovely oaked beam building called "College Hall". It had a dining hall in it and one day some students were up examining the workmanship of the beams, when they noticed a lot of wood beetles. Other people from the college were brought in and determined the beetles had made the beams structurally unsound. But where could the ever find trees big enough to replace the beams in modern Britain? They decided to ask the College forester for advice. He said he had been waiting for them to come around. Everyone knows oak beams get beetles, eventually. So when the hall was built a grove of oak trees was planted and each forester, down through generations was told, "Don't cut those trees, they are for College Hall". And so there were plenty of huge oak tress all ready for the job.
