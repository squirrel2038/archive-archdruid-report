I'm sure most of my readers have heard at least a little of the hullaballoo surrounding the release of Pope Francis’ encyclical on the environment, Laudato Si. It’s been entertaining to watch, not least because so many politicians in the United States who like to use Vatican pronouncements as window dressing for their own agendas have been left scrambling for cover now that the wind from Rome is blowing out of a noticeably different quarter. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Take Rick Santorum, a loudly Catholic Republican who used to be in the US Senate and now spends his time entertaining a variety of faux-conservative venues with his signature flavor of hate speech. Santorum loves to denounce fellow Catholics who disagree with Vatican edicts as “cafeteria Catholics,” and announced a while back that John F. Kennedy’s famous defense of the separation of church and state made him sick to his stomach. In the wake of Laudato Si, care to guess who’s elbowing his way to the head of the cafeteria line? Yes, that would be Santorum, who’s been insisting since the encyclical came out that the Pope is wrong and American Catholics shouldn’t be obliged to listen to him. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What makes all the yelling about Laudato Si a source of wry amusement to me is that it’s not actually a radical document at all. It’s a statement of plain common sense. It should have been obvious all along that treating the air as a gaseous sewer was a really dumb idea, and in particular, that dumping billions upon billions of tons of infrared-reflecting gases into the atmosphere would change its capacity for heat retention in unwelcome ways. It should have been just as obvious that all the other ways we maltreat the only habitable planet we’ve got were guaranteed to end just as badly. That this wasn’t obvious—that huge numbers of people find it impossible to realize that you can only wet your bed so many times before you have to sleep in a damp spot—deserves much more attention than it’s received so far. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s really a curious blindness, when you think about it. Since our distant ancestors climbed unsteadily down from the trees of late Pliocene Africa, the capacity to anticipate threats and do something about them has been central to the success of our species. A rustle in the grass might indicate the approach of a leopard, a series of unusually dry seasons might turn the local water hole into undrinkable mud: those of our ancestors who paid attention to such things, and took constructive action in response to them, were more likely to survive and leave offspring than those who shrugged and went on with business as usual. That’s why traditional societies around the world are hedged about with a dizzying assortment of taboos and customs meant to guard against every conceivable source of danger. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Somehow, though, we got from that to our present situation, where substantial majorities across the world’s industrial nations seem unable to notice that something bad can actually happen to them, where thoughtstoppers of the “I’m sure they’ll think of something” variety take the place of thinking about the future, and where, when something bad does happen to someone, the immediate response is to find some way to blame the victim for what happened, so that everyone else can continue to believe that the same thing can’t happen to them. A world where Laudato Si is controversial, not to mention necessary, is a world that’s become dangerously detached from the most basic requirements of collective survival. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>

<div class=MsoNormal>
For quite some time now, I’ve been wondering just what lies behind the bizarre paralogic with which most people these days turn blank and uncomprehending eyes on their onrushing fate. The process of writing last week’s blog post on the astonishing stupidity of US foreign policy, though, seems to have helped me push through to clarity on the subject. I may be wrong, but I think I’ve figured it out. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s begin with the issue at the center of last week’s post, the realy remarkable cluelessness with which US policy toward Russia and China has convinced both nations they have nothing to gain from cooperating with a US-led global order, and are better off allying with each other and opposing the US instead. US politicians and diplomats made that happen, and the way they did it was set out in detail in <a href=http://www.nationalinterest.org/blog/paul-pillar/the-odd-american-view-negotiation-13159>a recent and thoughtful article</a> by Paul R. Pillar in the online edition of <i>The National Interest</i>. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Pillar’s article pointed out that the United States has evolved a uniquely counterproductive notion of how negotiation works. Elsewhere on the planet, people understand that when you negotiate, you’re seeking a compromise where you get whatever you most need out of the situation, while the other side gets enough of its own agenda met to be willing to cooperate. To the US, by contrast, negotiation means that the other side complies with US demands, and that’s the end of it. The idea that other countries might have their own interests, and might expect to receive some substantive benefit in exchange for cooperation with the US, has apparently never entered the heads of official Washington—and the absence of that idea has resulted in the cascading failures of US foreign policy in recent years.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s only fair to point out that the United States isn’t the only practitioner of this kind of self-defeating behavior. A first-rate example has been unfolding in Europe in recent months—yes, that would be the ongoing non-negotiations between the Greek government and the so-called troika, the coalition of unelected bureaucrats who are trying to force Greece to keep pursuing a failed economic policy at all costs. The attitude of the troika is simple: the only outcome they’re willing to accept is capitulation on the part of the Greek government, and they’re not willing to give anything in return. Every time the Greek government has tried to point out to the troika that negotiation usually involves some degree of give and take, the bureaucrats simply give them a blank look and reiterate their previous demands. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That attitude has had drastic political consequences. It’s already convinced Greeks to elect a radical leftist government in place of the compliant centrists who ruled the country in the recent past. If the leftists fold, the neofascist Golden Dawn party is waiting in the wings. The problem with the troika’s stance is simple: the policies they’re insisting that Greece must accept have never—not once in the history of market economies—produced anything but mass impoverishment and national bankruptcy. The Greeks, among many other people, know this; they know that Greece will not return to prosperity until it <a href=../../2012/07/the-upside-of-default.html>defaults on its foreign debts</a> the way Russia did in 1998, and scores of other countries have done as well. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If the troika won’t settle for a negotiated debt-relief program, and the current Greek government won’t default, the Greeks will elect someone else who will, no matter who that someone else happens to be; it’s that, after all, or continue along a course that’s already caused the Greek economy to lose a quarter of its precrisis GDP, and shows no sign of stopping anywhere this side of failed-state status. That this could quite easily hand Greece over to a fascist despot is just one of the potential problems with the troika’s strategy. It’s astonishing that so few people in Europe seem to be able to remember what happened the last time an international political establishment committed itself to the preservation of a failed economic orthodoxy no matter what; those of my readers who don’t know what I’m talking about may want to pick up any good book on the rise of fascism in Europe between the wars.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s step back from specifics, though, and notice the thinking that underlies the dysfunctional behavior in Washington and Brussels alike. In both cases, the people who think they’re in charge have lost track of the fact that Russia, China, and Greece have needs, concerns, and interests of their own, and aren’t simply dolls that the US or EU can pose at will. These other nations can, perhaps, be bullied by threats over the short term, but that’s a strategy with a short shelf life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Successful diplomacy depends on giving the other guy reasons to want to cooperate with you, while demanding cooperation at gunpoint guarantees that the other guy is going to look for ways to shoot back. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The same sort of thinking in a different context underlies the brutal stupidity of American drone attacks in the Middle East. Some wag in the media pointed out a while back that the US went to war against an enemy 5,000 strong, we’ve killed 10,000 of them, and now there are only 20,000 left. That’s a good summary of the situation; the US drone campaign has been a total failure by every objective measure, having worked out consistently to the benefit of the Muslim extremist groups against which it’s aimed, and yet nobody in official Washington seems capable of noticing this fact. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s hard to miss the conclusion, in fact, that the Obama administration thinks that in pursuing its drone-strike program, it’s playing some kind of video game, which the United States can win if it can rack up enough points. Notice the way that every report that a drone has taken out some al-Qaeda leader gets hailed in the media: hey, we nailed a commander, doesn’t that boost our score by five hundred? In the real world, meanwhile the indiscriminate slaughter of civilians by US drone strikes has become a core factor convincing Muslims around the world that the United States is just as evil as the jihadis claim, and thus sending young men by the thousands to join the jihadi ranks. Has anyone in the Obama administration caught on to this straightforward arithmetic of failure? Surely you jest. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For that matter, I wonder how many of my readers recall the much-ballyhooed “surge” in Afghanistan several years back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The “surge” was discussed at great length in the US media before it was enacted on Afghan soil; talking heads of every persuasion babbled learnedly about how many troops would be sent, how long they’d stay, and so on. It apparently never occurred to anybody in the Pentagon or the White House that the Taliban could visit websites and read newspapers, and get a pretty good idea of what the US forces in Afghanistan were about to do. That’s exactly what happened, too; the Taliban simply hunkered down for the duration, and popped back up the moment the extra troops went home. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Both these examples of US military failure are driven by the same problem discussed earlier in the context of diplomacy: an inability to recognize that the other side will reliably respond to US actions in ways that further its own agenda, rather than playing along with the US. More broadly, it’s the same failure of thought that leads so many people to assume that the biosphere is somehow obligated to give us all the resources we want and take all the abuse we choose to dump on it, without ever responding in ways that might inconvenience us. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We can sum up all these forms of acquired stupidity in a single sentence: most people these days seem to have lost the ability to grasp that the other side can learn. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The entire concept of learning has been so poisoned by certain bad habits of contemporary thought that it’s probably necessary to pause here. Learning, in particular, isn’t the same thing as rote imitation. If you memorize a set of phrases in a foreign language, for example, that doesn’t mean you’ve learned that language. To learn the language means to grasp the underlying structure, so that you can come up with your own phrases and say whatever you want, not just what you’ve been taught to say. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the same way, if you memorize a set of disconnected factoids about history, you haven’t learned history. This is something of a loaded topic right now in the US, because recent “reforms” in the American<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>public school system have replaced learning with rote memorization of disconnected factoids that are then regurgitated for multiple choice tests. This way of handling education penalizes those children who figure out how to learn, since they might well come up with answers that differ from the ones the test expects. That’s one of many ways that US education these days actively discourages learning—but that’s a subject for another post.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To learn is to grasp the underlying structure of a given subject of knowledge, so that the learner can come up with original responses to it. That’s what Russia and China did; they grasped the underlying structure of US diplomacy, figured out that they had nothing to gain by cooperating with that structure, and came up with a creative response, which was to ally against the United States. That’s what Greece is doing, too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Bit by bit, the Greeks seem to be figuring out the underlying structure of troika policy, which amounts to the systematic looting of southern Europe for the benefit of Germany and a few of its allies, and are trying to come up with a response that doesn’t simply amount to unilateral submission. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s also what the jihadis and the Taliban are doing in the face of US military activity. If life hands you lemons, as the saying goes, make lemonade; if the US hands you drone strikes that routinely slaughter noncombatants, you can make very successful propaganda out of it—and if the US hands you a surge, you roll your eyes, hole up in your mountain fastnesses, and wait for the Americans to get bored or distracted, knowing that this won’t take long. That’s how learning works, but that’s something that US planners seem congenitally unable to take into account. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The same analysis, interestingly enough, makes just as much sense when applied to nonhuman nature. As Ervin Laszlo pointed out a long time ago in <i>Introduction to Systems Philosophy</i>, any sufficiently complex system behaves in ways that approximate intelligence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Consider the way that bacteria respond to antibiotics. Individually, bacteria are as dumb as politicians, but their behavior on the species level shows an eerie similarity to learning; faced with antibiotics, a species of bacteria “tries out” different biochemical approaches until it finds one that sidesteps the antibiotic. In the same way, insects and weeds “try out” different responses to pesticides and herbicides until they find whatever allows them to munch on crops or flourish in the fields no matter how much poison the farmer sprays on them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We can even apply the same logic to the environmental crisis as a whole. Complex systems tend to seek equilibrium, and will respond to anything that pushes them away from equilibrium by pushing back the other way. Any field biologist can show you plenty of examples: if conditions allow more rabbits to be born in a season, for instance, the population of hawks and foxes rises accordingly, reducing the rabbit surplus to a level the ecosystem can support. As humanity has put increasing pressure on the biosphere, the biosphere has begun to push back with increasing force, in an increasing number of ways; is it too much to think of this as a kind of learning, in which the biosphere “tries out” different ways to balance out the abusive behavior of humanity, until it finds one or more that work? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course it’s long been a commonplace of modern thought that natural systems can’t possibly learn. The notion that nature is static, timeless, and unresponsive, a passive stage on which human beings alone play active roles, is welded into modern thought, unshaken even by the realities of biological evolution or the rising tide of evidence that natural systems are in fact quite able to adapt their way around human meddling. There’s a long and complex history to the notion of passive nature, but that’s a subject for another day; what interests me just now is that since 1990 or so, the governing classes of the United States, and some other Western nations as well, have applied the same frankly delusional logic to everything in the world other than themselves. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“We’re an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality,” neoconservative guru Karl Rove is credited as saying to reporter Ron Suskind. “We’re history’s actors, and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.” That seems to be the thinking that governs the US government these days, on both sides of the supposed partisan divide. Obama says we’re in a recovery, and if the economy fails to act accordingly, why, rooms full of industrious flacks churn out elaborately fudged statistics to erase that unwelcome reality. That history’s self-proclaimed actors might turn out to be just one more set of flotsam awash on history’s vast tides has never entered their darkest dream. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s step back from specifics again, though. What’s the source of this bizarre paralogic—the delusion that leads politicians to think that they create reality, and that everyone and everything else can only fill the roles they’ve been assigned by history’s actors?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I think I know. I think it comes from a simple but remarkably powerful fact, which is that the people in question, along with most people in the privileged classes of the industrial world, spend most of their time, from childhood on, dealing with machines. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We can define a machine as a subset of the universe that’s been deprived of the capacity to learn. The whole point of building a machine is that it does what you want, when you want it, and nothing else. Flip the switch on, and it turns on and goes through whatever rigidly defined set of behaviors it’s been designed to do; flip the switch off, and it stops. It may be fitted with controls, so you can manipulate its behavior in various tightly limited ways; nowadays, especially when computer technology is involved, the set of behaviors assigned to it may be complex enough that an outside observer may be fooled into thinking that there’s learning going on. <a href=../../2012/01/myth-of-machine.html>There’s no inner life behind the facade</a>, though.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It can’t learn, and to the extent that it pretends to learn, what happens is the product of the sort of rote memorization described above as the antithesis of learning. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A machine that learned would be capable of making its own decisions and coming up with a creative response to your actions—and that’s the opposite of what machines are meant to do, because that response might well involve frustrating your intentions so the machine can get what it wants instead. That’s why the trope of machines going to war against human beings has so large a presence in popular culture: it’s exactly because we expect machines not to act like people, not to pursue their own needs and interests, that the thought of machines acting the way we do gets so reliable a frisson of horror. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The habit of thought that treats the rest of the cosmos as a collection of machines, existing only to fulfill whatever purpose they might be assigned by their operators, is another matter entirely. Its origins can be traced back to the dawning of the scientific revolution in the seventeenth century, when a handful of thinkers first began to suggest that the universe might not be a vast organism—as everybody in the western world had presupposed for millennia before then—but might instead be a vast machine. It’s indicative that one immediate and popular response to this idea was to insist that other living things were simply “meat machines” who didn’t actually suffer pain under the vivisector’s knife, but had been designed by God to imitate sounds of pain in order to inspire feelings of pity in human beings. </div>
<br>The delusion of control—the conviction, apparently immune to correction by mere facts, that the world is a machine incapable of doing anything but the things we want it to do—pervades contemporary life in the world’s industrial societies. People in those societies spend so much more time dealing with machines than they do interacting with other people and other living things without a machine interface getting in the way, that it’s no wonder that this delusion is so widespread. As long as it retains its grip, though, we can expect the industrial world, and especially its privileged classes, to stumble onward from one preventable disaster to another. That’s the inner secret of the delusion of control, after all: those who insist on seeing the world in mechanical terms end up behaving mechanically themselves. Those who deny all other things the ability to learn lose the ability to learn from their own mistakes, and lurch robotically onward along a trajectory that leads straight to the scrapheap of the future.</div>

Bravo! This why I so much look forward to the middle of the week. And yet, this can be viewed from another aspect too; mainly psychological. It seems to me that the majority of people's behavior and not just our "beloved" elites can be explained by two psychological concepts - delusion and self-centeredness. Self-centeredness is somewhat obvious. When you are only concerned about your own interests and goals to the exclusion of all else and never giving any thought to any probable responses or consequences which might arise from your actions.I see this countless times in people everyday. I, too, was guilty of this in my teens and twenties until it occurred to me that my life would go a lot easier if I recognize that other people have their own agendas and my actions will have consequences that I might not like if I continue ignoring this basic fact. Unfortunately, it looks like very few people come to the same realization. <br>Another realization I had was that at the core of self-centeredness is deprivation. The person is so deprived of authentic self-esteem that they have to have a substitute in order to get on in the world. And this is were delusion comes into play. They fashion an image of themselves that doesn't necessarily correspond to who they actually are but as they would like the world to see them. And, unfortunately for them, this image of themselves is not too stable and needs constant affirmations from others. But, it does convey one advantage to the person in that it makes them impervious to the truth. But for everyone else who has to deal with them, it leaves them baffled at their cluelessness.<br><br><a href=#c3494966307558606515 title="comment permalink">6/24/15, 4:50 PM</a><br><br>

As for climate refugees, I give it a year before they start moving in significant numbers. <br><br>Jim, excellent! Yes, you can define a machine in several different ways -- lack of will, lack of responsibility, lack of an inner life, lack of the capacity to learn, all are ways of talking about the same thing: the state to which a certain mode of thinking in the Western world would like to reduce the whole cosmos. More on this down the road a bit. <br><br>Tortoise, of course you're quite right; thank you. <br><br>Sage, yes, but you'll doubtless have noticed that delusion and self-centeredness are common to human beings everywhere, while the specific fantasy of reducing the cosmos to the status of a machine is more or less unique to the modern western world. I think the fantasy deserves study in its own right. <br><br>Center, you're welcome -- and be aware that the Fred Halliots of our future may in fact say that. BTW, it's "fascist" with two esses, not "facist" with one -- I'm pretty sure a facist is someone who has weird beliefs about other people's faces. ;-)<br><br><a href=#c812609524005494733 title="comment permalink">6/24/15, 5:04 PM</a><br><br>

Some of my nerd buddies were talking about the virtues of video games, and how they taught problem solving skills, which of course made our generation far smarter than any of the previous generations. Six or seven years ago, when was still living in the 'college machine' I would have been constructing crafty arguments to support their point, but since I started trying to live outside of the script I was given by the education system I have been unable to avoid learning better.<br><br>The point I wanted to make was that my generation (and if I am an exception it is in all too limited of contexts by all too narrow of margins) are on average quite idiotic; meaning to convey a touch of the old Greek flavor of that word for a person who is mentally disconnected from other. I also wanted to suggest that video games made it worse, and that they did so in a way that is very similar to the way that standardized tests make the problem worse; implying that it is only the fact that video games are addictive and tests are agonizing which makes one feel good and the other feel bad for learning.<br><br>With video games one does encounter interesting riddles and challenges and has an opportunity to experiment to discover solutions. This feels very much like learning, especially joined with a captivating (as in captive) narrative. And there are a certain subset of problems that one can learn to figure out by playing enough video games. The kind of problem that can be imagined, pitched, implemented and sold by human beings, who happen to be employed in the production of video games. Even games where unintended features become an important part of actual play follow this rule, because the unintended feature has to make sense in the context of the logic of the game space.<br><br>The kind of problems invented by a person with any motive other than creating entertainment of you, very rarely are encountered; the kind of problems that can exist in substantial portion of reality not subject to human ordering are unknown to the gamer. <br><br>Of course standardized tests are precisely the same thing, with the exception that inspead of being the kind of problems invented by the kind of human tasked with entertaining you, it is the kind of problems invented by the kind of human tasked with judging you like a show dog.<br><br>I think this is why so much of the thought around us exists in the context of deciding if something is entertaining, or worrying about being judged. I think those are the most mentally stimulating kinds of machine relationships most people are put into.<br><br><a href=#c8660994303302399581 title="comment permalink">6/24/15, 5:22 PM</a><br><br>

But the reason I was interested in the point is that our machine trained generation is capable of the innate human power of learning, and once thrown into reality can catch up on learning remarkably fast, but the learning curve at the beginning is brutal. Working with some very clever and interesting friends in the garden, college age, can be harder than most 5 year olds. If they do not have command line computer code clear directions they freeze up like a Windows ME machine at the slightest disruption, and often proceed to do counter productive things until you find them and reset them to a new task. If you make the slightest sign of being able to perceive their dysfunction the judgment code triggers and things can go down hill quickly.<br><br>I ain't trying to be mean here, shoot outside of a few contexts where I have been deprogrammed by the school of hard knocks this whole analysis could be applied to me; and besides I have seen many folk shake off the worst of this, and once most folk get a real good taste of actual learning, they are eager for more, because learning, real learning, feels real good.<br><br>As a final thought, I think that the severity of the problem I perceived is stronger correlated to social status during upbringing that it is to taste in video games; of course the social systems we live in are the most impactful game most people play, the games and gadgets are all mostly a diversion from the stuff that really move us... slightly different line of thought than your post, but games and machines are very similar in that both have to exist with in a human defined logical space... excepting the good games that are on the fly fun or the cool machines that are stuff rigger together on the fly to get something done.<br><br><a href=#c2155872747380570431 title="comment permalink">6/24/15, 5:26 PM</a><br><br>

And if they are shown to be wrong, they'll change.<br><br>2) On negotiation - At one point in my career, a company offered me a position, but no negotiation on *anything*. After things fell through (naturally!), it reminded me that the people who won't negotiate are treating you like that of two other groups - terrorists and hostage takers. No wonder why folks around the world feel slighted.<br><br>3) "Individually, bacteria are as dumb as politicians." Ha! Yeah, but politicians don't seem to learn, as they traditionally ignore the idea in item 1!<br><br>Although a lot of technical/computer types deal with machines, some of them (especially in maker/hacker spaces, as they evolve and get smarter!) are starting to learn the 'monkey' stuff of human interaction. A lot of this is realizing that people are not machines, and that when you do things like create rules, they have to be used by humans. This 'squishy' emotional stuff is sometimes tough to learn, but once you figure some of it out, it makes life *so* much easier - and fun. Being able to interact with people in my technical world as *humans* (with all the attendant emotions/ego) has not only made my life more pleasant, but people tend to hire folks who they can get along with.<br><br>I wonder if the folks who prefer machine-like/mathematical interactions have been introduced to the mathematics of chaos theory. It might just get their minds thinking that even systems that have very simple and well defined rules can go off the rails. There's a great short piece in the book _Jurassic Park_ on this. Controlling a chaotic system is not the same as controlling a linear one.<br><br>Your thesis does make a heck of a lot of sense. To play the part of the 'loyal opposition'; JMG (or anyone else) - can you see a weak point in this theory?

I guess it points to those difficulties with negotiation, and perceiving everything as soulless, mindless machines - including, I suspect, themselves. Theology has become something to be twisted into shape to support political programmes - that's not unique to our time, of course - but we should recognise those who do so as 'agenda-benders'... <br><br>Could Francis be the vanguard of a new religious sensibility that takes his church into the space it needs to occupy in a collapsing world?

But I'm not convinced it's the root cause, or at least there is twist to add to it. The twist is that the personalities of those who are able to climb the greasy pole of leadership in our highly complex, machine-enabled societies almost guarantee that they won't learn or reconsider. They just can't do quiet reflection and reconsideration. The words "oh dear, I messed up, I was wrong, how silly am I?" are just not in their vocabularies. <br><br>Now my own life, if I'm honest about it, has been a continual series of semi-failures in terms of my ability to really control events. Despite my awesome plans (in relationships, careers, children and certainly gardening) events usually unfold in ways that I hadn't anticipated. Not always bad ways, but certainly not what I was aiming for. At an earlier stage in my life, I found this deeply frustrating; but in later years I just came to enjoy the ride with all its ups and downs and round and rounds. (I think coming to that realization is one of the main high points of life, btw). Unfortunately, though, the types of people who are capable of running large organizations seem to be temperamentally the least likely to yield to this realization. So these driven, highly capable personalities continue to pretend, to themselves and others, that they can indeed control the world; and they also seem to have unlimited capacity for sweeping repeated failures under their psychological rugs. That's my theory, at least. So I think we're at peak Admiral Farragut in that regard.<br><br>In other news, we have finally found a new place to live.

I'll finish the rest afterward and maybe comment again (if you'll pardon me), but I had two thoughts.<br><br>First, as a sedevacantist Catholic, it doesn't matter to me what Bergoglio says, anymore than I would care about a declaration from the Coptic miaphysite pope or an imam. But I think I can understand where at least some of the annoyance comes from here. Obviously a huge portion of it is backlash against the encyclical on account of it contradicting the views of deniers. That's beyond dispute.<br>But another part has to do with the danger involved in the whole endeavor, and the feeling that Bergoglio has grossly overstepped his boundaries. The papacy is considered infallible by Catholics when it either speaks infallibly (ex cathedra statements, which are rare), or when it is laying down rules for universal practice (the ordinary and universal magisterium). Encyclicals, moreover, have been reserved exclusively to issues of faith and morals for a very long time. To many, this seems far too political and specific to fall under the scope of papal infallibility, and yet has been issued in precisely that form.<br>As unlikely as it is, for instance, let's say that one day it turns out there really isn't anthropogenic climate change. We would then be in a position where the supposed papacy's infallibility has failed, which is more than a little concerning.<br>Many would argue that the whole document is outside of the "faith and morals" sphere, which is their grounds for ignoring it, but this is of course contrary to Bergoglio/Francis' whole intention. He thinks it is very much a moral issue. So from the Catholic mindset, this is a huge, huge mess. The closest parallel I can even think of is Pope Leo XIII's declarations promoting unions, and it's not a perfect fit. The fallout from all this could be substantial.<br><br>Secondly, I think the reason we are blind to these dangerous shifts to our survivability is because the nature of the threats has changed. We as a species have rarely ever had to face the situation where our actions are so large that they begin to damage the very systems on which they depend. Understanding the threat of a jaguar is a thing we've long understood; understanding the threat of killing every jaguar is the kind of problem we've universally failed to deal with rationally. It's really the flaw of our whole era, from climate change to corporations so large they dwarf nations to overfishing and so on. We have a moral system in the West that is fundamentally individualistic, and a set of problems that are fundamentally collective in nature.<br><br>Just my two cents.

Instead, it's a concept from ancient Greece: hubris.<br><br>Learning is a two-edged sword: things which give you a short-term advantage can also lead to your long-term destruction. Consider, for example, the way that Republican politicians have learned not to make any concessions to Democrats. Those who compromise are not re-elected - and it's not at all clear that they'll keep winning elections via this tactic. It will, or course, lead to their ultimate destruction, either by the voters waking up, or a massive defeat when the rest of the world turns against their arrogance. (Imagine China dumping all their US Bond holdings, waiting a few months, and then invading Taiwan once the economic collapse reached a sufficient level of disorder.)<br><br>"Pride goeth before a fall" is another example of the arrogance problem in history. The myth of American superiority will at some point be busted... and although I expect the Republicans will successfully find a scapegoat to blame, they'll have an increasingly difficult time conducting necessary negotiations with other countries when their base demands a no compromise position.<br><br>In short, people in the US are in for an educational experience in the long-term effects of short-term thinking.

In a nutshell, metacognition assumes that human beings (and others beings, although you wont have many learning researchers admitting to that) can think about their thinking, can evalute their progress, adapt their behavior, and evalute outcomes after the fact. We know this concept is critical to effective learning (as is abstraction, which JMG mentioned in his post). As a learning researcher, I have witnessed so many times how terrible modern Americans are in being metacognitivey aware. Getting people to be metacognitive and self reflective--even in somethinig as simple as learning various subject matter in a college setting--is like pulling teeth. Most learners see exercises designed to teach metacognitive awareness as the most pointless exercise, busywork, useless. But without it, we cease to learn from our behaviors, we make the same mistakes over and over, and attribute the outcomes of those mistakes to others, and we fail to develop abstract understandings. That seems to be part of what is happening on a larger scale here.<br><br><a href=#c3475425027404972682 title="comment permalink">6/24/15, 7:59 PM</a><br><br>

I think the one I suggested actually explains our circumstance quite well. In the context of government, that's because we have a system that is, at its heart, a machine, I suppose. But this goes into what I mentioned, namely our blindness toward the whole systems effects created by our actions, which has led to everything from extinctions to revolutions.<br><br>When a government or set of rulers gets sufficiently large, and there is no real "king" of sorts, then there is no one doing the long-term planning. There are only people playing their roles. <br><br>1: My role as ambassador is to apply pressure to the Chinese government so that they cave to the policy set by the State Department. The big picture planning happens elsewhere.<br>2: My role at the State Department is to conceive of the ideal goals and outcomes of this relationship with China, and convey those. The big picture planning and implementation happens elsewhere.<br>3: My role as president is to follow the recommendations of my advisors and to act in the best interests of the United States in a way my constituents understand. The big picture planning is done by my staff and the American people.<br>4: My role as voter is to choose the candidate who best represents my interests. The big picture planning is done by them after they're elected.<br><br>And so on. NOBODY is planning. If anyone does, power is sufficiently distributed that inertia from other agencies prevents anything from getting done. Everyone plays their role in the system, expecting the system to then take care of itself, and none of them ever doubt that they're doing their duty and everything is fine - if something terrible happens, well, they did their part. Our system disposed of "true statesmen" because they aren't a useful part of the system. Instead those people write blog posts about where the true statesmen went.<br><br>In just the same way, a corporation can be comprised of thoroughly decent individuals, each doing their part as they see it, and the organization as a whole can be utterly evil in its actions. The people can try their best to live a morally and socially responsible life, and society as a whole can be a wasteful, unsustainable disaster. A woman can be murdered in the street, and if enough people are looking on, nobody does anything because surely someone already has.<br><br>We just don't think in systems, at all, especially not on the proper individual role within a system that's gotten bigger than it can be to function properly. It's only ever a learned behavior, and a difficult one to learn at that. We needn't worry about the fall of Rome because Rome is eternal and far bigger than you or me. <br><br>So no one worries about Rome.

In fact the more you deal with complex and tempramental machines the more you realize that care, patience and good karma are rewarded while haste, beligerance and ignorance result in messy failure. I think that the machine analogy only applies to those who are one step removed from machines and interact with them in insulated manner, such as riding in an elevator.<br> I would propose that another source of the clueless nature of the elites is the nature of the rackets and relationships they were involved with as they climbed to power. As the powerfull have successfully acheived monopolies or oligopolies in both business and government they have aquired the ability to dictact terms to those lower on the totem pole. A good example is commercial banking. If one takes out a business loan from a bank the bank is never interested in negotiating after the intial papers are signed. They dictate all relationships, terms and consequences from that point on regardless of the needs of the borrower. The same is true of insurance companies, airlines, large landlords, railroads, and most utilities. Theses attitudes have permeated the elites as they have moved from banking to statesmanship to politics. They assume that the citizens of Greece are just like someone who has not paid their mortgage, or taken an oversize bottle of shampoo in the TSA screening line. They then even assume that someone like Putin must be handeled in the same way you handle a malcontent at the DMV. I agree that they seem to miss that their opponents can learn, but they also ignorently assume a power position even if they don't have one.<br><br><a href=#c3296850922645205656 title="comment permalink">6/24/15, 9:25 PM</a><br><br>

All the problems in a computer game are created by human beings; they're designed to be solved, and to be entertaining, in the course of game play. Thus they differ in every imaginable sense from the real problems people face in the real world. <br><br>Bob, exactly. The widening chasm between appearance and reality is a huge issue here. <br><br>Dammerung, I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but please get some counseling. That really isn't a useful way of thinking. <br><br>Peakfuture, oh, there are lots of weak points. The one that I'm exploring right now is this: where did the idea of the machine come from? It's not an obvious or a natural thing, and the cultural forces that led an entire civilization to redefine the world in terms of this very odd concept need much more exploration before I can consider this more than a very tentative hypothesis. <br><br>Dave, thanks for the link. I note that the article states that the effect of a solar minimum would be a small fraction of the effect of anthropogenic greenhouse gases, so would mostly just add some unpredictability to what's already a highly unpredictable system. <br><br>Fudoshin, excellent! That earns you tonight's gold star. I wonder if any of the people who insist that human beings have the right to receive water from nature have ever wondered if there's anything that nature has a right to receive from human beings...<br><br>Pinku-sensei, yes, I saw your comments on that. It's really quite funny to watch the pseudoconservatives doing everything they accuse the liberals of doing. <br><br>Harry, that's fascinating. It suggests that the basic corporate mentality has shifted from "making sure we win" to "making sure that everyone else loses" -- and it's axiomatic in organizational theory that when that point is reached by competing interests in an organization, the inevitable result is total destruction of the organization.<br><br>Blueback, yes, I've watched the paralogic involved over and over again.

More on this in an upcoming post. <br><br>Rapier, Orwell had a point. As I noted above, the illusion of power -- which is what we're talking about, of course -- is addictive. <br><br>Otto, good. It's not accidental that Yesod is considered "the automatic consciousness," either -- one could as well term it "the mechanical consciousness"...<br><br>Cherokee, how big of a Roman Catholic population do you have in Oz? Here it's a quarter of the population -- thus the difference in media coverage, I suspect. <br><br>Denys, exactly. Next question: how might each of us best go to work getting rid of those counterproductive reactions in ourselves? <br><br>Ben, I'm sure that's also a part of it. There's a machine-mindedness that transcends any individual machine. <br><br>Tom, nicely put -- and I won't argue for a moment about the Kennedys. You could add several more examples to the list, of course. <br><br>Yupped, congrats on the farmhouse! As for the broader issue, I note that an ability to learn from failure is by no means absent from the ruling classes of other historical societies -- though admittedly it usually goes away for good about the time the whole shebang begins sliding toward the dumpster. <br><br>Spinny, and that's also an issue!<br><br>Derv, I certainly don't intend to argue about the legitimacy of an institution to which I have even less connection than you do! Still, I think you're missing a central point. What Francis is saying, and what I'm also saying, is that morality extends beyond the sphere of today's humanity. How we treat the biosphere is a moral issue; what kind of world we leave to futurte generations is also a moral issue -- one could argue, in fact, that it's among the most profound moral issues there is. The fact that our civilization doesn't get that, when so many other human societies have treated it as a matter of course, is to my mind something that needs careful examination. <br><br>RepubAnon, here again, hubris is ancient; the stunning blindness of today's Americans to the consequences of their own immediate actions is, I think, something at least a little unusual in history.<br><br><a href=#c6082282592073463567 title="comment permalink">6/24/15, 9:40 PM</a><br><br>

It would be most interesting to see whether there are studies exploring the correlation between inadequate metacognition and amount of exposure to certain technologies -- television, for example, or as Ray suggested above, video games. <br><br>Blueback, but most Americans these days <i>are</i> fragile hothouse flowers. They've been raised in a wholly artificial environment, sheltered from contact with reality, and fed a constant diet of artificial mental stimulants in the form of TV programs, internet content, video games, etc. Of course they crumple when they brush up against challenges to their frail self-concept -- so would anybody raised in those profoundly debilitating conditions. As a side note, btw, I grant you Conan, but Elric? He was another hothouse flower; without exotic drugs or the black sword Stormbringer, he was a weakling (which was one of Moorcock's very clever touches in those novels -- he really went to town, standing the cliches of Weird Tales-era heroic fantasy on their head.)<br><br>Bigsky, I don't know many engineers who are delusional about technology -- no doubt because they actually have to deal with its dysfunctions and bad habits, day in and day out. It's the people who don't know how to vacuum the dust out of the grilles on the back of their computers who seem to think that technology is as invincible as it is omnibenevolent. <br><br>Steve, I'm far from sure I buy the claim that sociopathy is any more common at the top of the social ladder than at its bottom. <br><br>M, the problem there is that the response to the events of 9/11 was a matter of defending business as usual against disruption. The challenge we face now is that of abandoning business as usual, because it's become the cause of its own disruption!<br><br>Lessertruth, Herbert was very much on the ball when he talked about machines. <br><br>Derv, and that's also part of the problem. I'm not convinced that it explains the peculiar detachment we see in today's Americans, though. What exactly is a corporation, by the way?

For example, having their only source of water cut off because they can't pay the bill, or a river dammed up, etc. When we demand our "rights," we're generally demanding something from other people, not from nature. It is often indigenous peoples (who tend to be much more aware of how nature works than industrialized peoples) who are deprived of their water rights *by other people*.

All traditional societies, plus Western European society up until the point of the Renaissance had a world view that centred around God/gods/spirits etc, with the community's needs coming next in order of importance, and then the needs of the individual coming in a distant third. The Renaissance was the beginning of the process of reversing that order until with the rise of humanism in the West, the individual became firmly established in the centre of the universe. <br><br>My question was this - did the cult of the individual, or the popularisation of the view of a mechanistic universe come first? But in writing this comment, an answer presents itself - in a traditional, pre-industrial society, a community must organise itself around the very real limits of its local environment. Its religion provides rules governing the distribution and preservation of its limited resources, so community MUST come before the individual.<br><br>The Renaissance saw the beginning of the Western European empire, where the global South was plundered to the very great advantage of the North. Once Western Europe had a huge and global resource base, it no longer required the local, communal, organic societal structure based on religion in order for it to survive. Thus there was almost a requirement for science to be 'invented', because the acquisition of wealth by individuals at the expense of the community is unthinkably immoral in a traditional society. The wealthy and powerful nouveau riche of the Renaissance were a completely new phenomenon in European history - they had wealth without responsibility, unlike the feudal lords before them. The invention of the mechanistic universe absolutely suited their agenda, because it removed any requirement for them to be responsible to or for the rest of their community. If this is indeed the case, then really, the rise of Science as we know it, ie, 'progress' and technology which is not tied to the limits of the natural world, or the good of the community in any way, was impossible without the wealth that the global South provided, and continued until now with the aid of the limitless(!) wealth that fossil fuels have provided. <br><br>This paved the way for the mess we now find ourselves in. If the individual is at the centre of the universe, then the earth is now host to billions of individual universes. Inevitably those little private universes bump into other private universes fairly frequently, at which point the mightiest universe wins. Currently we are all at the mercy of some very mighty individual universes indeed, who have been conditioned to believe that the individual's rights are paramount, but that some individuals are more individual than others..<br><br>And now, the cult of the individual is starting to crumble. It's a long way off yet, as you have noted in this series of posts: denial, etc - but already, the limits to growth are becoming uncomfortably apparent. Which means the end of the road for the individual. Because dividing scarce resources and observing the laws of nature are going to become a big part of our future. Which is why the encyclical of Pope Francis is so fascinating. In effect he is declaring that the age of the individual is over, that it is our collective religious responsibility to put community and the laws of nature ahead of our individual desires.<br><br>Some very powerful people are going to be so mad at him. I hate to think about what generally happens when an honest man speaks the uncomfortable truth to powerful people...<br><br><a href=#c1080745441427207271 title="comment permalink">6/24/15, 10:36 PM</a><br><br>

Not in the least. I was trying to say that Francis/Bergoglio is saying that, and those who are claiming they need not listen to him are basing it off the presumption that there can be no moral element to interaction with the biosphere. Anyone who accepts the idea that is has a moral character wouldn't have a problem with the overall thrust or message of the encyclical (nor do I, though I have other religious problems with it as a sedevacantist that I won't get into), while those who deny this think the encyclical is wildly outside the purview of the papacy, since it doesn't concern faith or morals. So it's a deeply fundamental dispute, and will lead to massive disruptions. That's all I was trying to say. But I've prattled on enough about this when it's not the topic of this blog, so I'll tap out here.<br><br>As far as detachment goes, the machine thinking may well play a role. But the short-sightedness and foolishness of many actors in our present system is, I think, more easily explained by the shortfalls of human thinking in massive systems. I mean, how can a tax code make sense, for instance, when it is too long for any individual to even know, let alone organize (70,000+ pages)? How can 435 congressman, 100 senators, a president, and 9 supreme court justices, alongside thousands upon thousands of lower level politicians and bureaucrats, each pursuing their own personal agenda and simply trying to fulfill their individual roles, actually make sensible plans? Perhaps they could when they were guided by statesmen and a coherent ideology, but both are gone, as I said, which is an inevitable byproduct of our system.<br><br>(continued...)<br><br><a href=#c8239482902166131890 title="comment permalink">6/24/15, 10:37 PM</a><br><br>

It isn't machine interaction that has led to a machine-like system and navel-gazing strategic planning. Rather, it's a system of complex rules, mechanisms, structures, institutions, and titles that has grown so unwieldy that it's become machine-like. Take, for instance, mandatory minimums and standardized testing. They take personal judgment and discernment entirely out of human processes in the name of "fairness," but really end up creating a mechanical system of "justice" and "education" that entirely fails in its purpose.<br><br>I guess I think you may be making the mistake that I've seen you (correctly) criticize others for making, in that you're acting as though our situation is unique when it's really just a part of the ordinary decline of a civilization. Were the Romans any less short-sighted, self-absorbed, and certain of their own invincibility? They made countless foreign policy blunders during the Great Migration, nearly all of which were rooted in the assumption of Rome's invincibility. They all simply played the part they believed they were supposed to play, because Rome had gotten too big for any one man to understand or direct (hence Diocletian's division). Everyone from Seneca to Cicero complained about the self-centeredness of the early imperial Roman character.<br><br>I think, as a civilization rolls over its apex into decline, the people are trapped. They see everything is going wrong, but don't know what to do about it. They feel utterly powerless, and believe this massive system is so utterly beyond them that it's useless to try and direct, change, or even understand it. So they keep their heads down and play their part, hoping to make a decent life for themselves. They've lost faith in the system, the state ideology, and often their religion, so they have no greater purpose to which they feel beholden. Naturally they become self-absorbed, then, and care only for themselves and their own. And whether they have faith in some bright future or are certain of its demise, it's all beyond them, so they just live their lives.<br><br>And that's how it goes, until things finally fall apart, and someone comes along to give them some new cause to believe in. Granted, navel-gazing has become easier than it's ever been today with a thousand distractions at hand. But I'd argue that it's just a fancier version of these two forces: the uncontrollable and incomprehensible size of "the system," and the sense of powerlessness that devolves inevitably into apathy and selfishness. I don't think it's unique to our era or civilization. I just think it's especially noticeable, and doubly so to an archdruid. :)<br><br><a href=#c8635695013533148130 title="comment permalink">6/24/15, 10:37 PM</a><br><br>

The concept of the machine had to exist, in at least a nascent form, before machines themselves could be designed and built; the question then becomes where the idea of depriving the world of its capacity to learn came from, and why it took over so large a part of the western world's collective imagination when it did. <br><br>Derv, good. As it happens, I'm not saying that it's different this time; I'm trying to grapple with the specific form taken in our time by a more general pathology, which has taken many other forms in the past. The reason's entirely pragmatic in nature, too: very often, if you can dredge up such an unspoken and unrecognized pattern from the crawlspaces of the imagination and name it, it loses some of its power over those who are willing to attend. If you will, I'm trying to find the true name of the particular evil spirit that's currently obsessing modern American society, so that it can be banished in proper form! <br><br>John, excellent! Yes, precisely; the delusion of control is just as common among those who think they're opposing the existing order of things as it is among the defenders of business as usual -- which is why so many of the former category instinctively go looking for some kind of machine to fix things, whether that's an electric car, a geoengineering device, or what have you.<br><br><a href=#c4848136810791151871 title="comment permalink">6/24/15, 11:15 PM</a><br><br>

The Central Valley is a place where it normally does not rain at all during the hottest months of the year, but the native oaks and grasses are adapted to that. It's a Mediterranean climate; winter, not summer, is the season when the hills turn green.<br><br>The Central Valley has two medium sized rivers running through the northern and middle parts of it. Before the Gold Rush, it had marshes, and John Muir called it "one great bee pasture". Pre-European settlement, the Central Valley supported herds of tule elk and flocks of migratory birds. (The ducks and geese still visit, wintering in the rice fields, but the elk are confined to a few inadequate refuges.) Anyone who has spent a winter in the Sacramento Valley or points north is well acquainted with tule fog (named for the reeds in those marshes), low lying belts of chilly moisture that cling to the ground for weeks on end. Local sources of water are not large enough to supply both water intensive crops like rice and cotton and an urban population. Farming and ranching took place before big water projects were built; it relied on shallow wells and the right to draw water from local rivers and creeks.<br><br>South of the San Joaquin watershed, the valley is (so I read; I haven't spent much time down there) pretty dry. However, the real this-was-desert-before-we-irrigated-it lands of California are not in the valley at all. They are south of it in and around Los Angeles and San Diego. Even there, the Owens River watered farms in the Owens Valley before a water project redirected all that water to LA. Bear in mind the scale; California is about as large as France and I reckon our Central Valley could swallow New England.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c1984179611316627320 title="comment permalink">6/24/15, 11:50 PM</a><br><br>

It is one of the very reasons we emerged as the super hunters, erasing large parts of the worlds megafauna in stone age times. Also it may seem odd first place to feel empathy in the activity of hunting, which is killing other beings, the advantage is twofold. <br><br>The first advantage is the cooperation with other hunters. Coordinating a hunting party in a complex environment by looks and short gestures is only possible when most of the information that has to be communicated is anticipated by the receiver, who uses empathy to anticipate messages from the sender. This ability humans share with the other successful team hunter of the northern hemisphere - the wolf. The close link between wolf/dog and human is caused by the ability to communicate between species by gestures and understand each other. This link is missing to all other species (e.g. cats).<br><br>The second advantage is the empathy with the prey. Understanding the sensual perception of the prey and its needs to draw conclusions of action from this perception gives the hunter the ability to anticipate the behavior of the prey. <br><br>So empathy is a key ability in dealing with both your allies and your enemies. The US seem to have lost this ability for both aspects. They stopped cooperating with allies and they stopped anticipating their prey behavior. While the Russians and Chinese seem to still utilize these abilities (that every human inherently should have) and team up as wolves and humans once did, the only role left to play seems to be the part of the megafauna – big and plentiful, but stupid and to slow to adapt.<br><br><a href=#c2105128516163974631 title="comment permalink">6/25/15, 12:42 AM</a><br><br>

That is, for the extent of recent memory, they always have been. They could be compared to a parent of the, "I'm in charge, do as I say school" who might succeed in raising their child to be a doormat but is more likely to get a shock when the kid grows up.<br><br>There's no excuse as regards the biosphere, though. As a plethora of weather gods attests, humans have always been at the whim of the environment. (Arguably this itself causes some of the mental block, but while "nothing we do can be having that much of an effect" is an argument people use, it's not the root of the issue.)<br><br>The planning inability seems curious at first glance, but humans do deal with different kinds of threats differently. An immediate, obvious threat (such as a leopard) is simple enough to deal with, but long-term, indirect threats are not. That might be why traditional societies have so many customs in that regard to begin with; because even knowing the facts, people would not take appropriate action to the return of a threat that was last an issue in their great-great-grandparent's day or which is caused by something they can't see happening. And that pretty much sums up the current predicament: both societally (since the start of the Industrial Revolution) and individually, we've never faced a major decrease in resource availability before.<br><br>Oh, and it's late Miocene, not late Pliocene. The end of the Pliocene does mark the point at which our ancestors stopped being bipedal-but-otherwise-typical apes and started being something-like-human.<br><br><a href=#c312394047674405633 title="comment permalink">6/25/15, 12:51 AM</a><br><br>

There is no evidence of either the willingness or capacity to learn anything beyond simple factoids in the vast majority of the (usually senior) managers we tend to work with (as coaches). After considering and abandoning a large number of hypotheses as to the why, we have currently settled on the model of adult cognitive development by Jane Loevinger and William Torbert's 'action logics', which expands on Loevinger's model. What we know from the research is that some 70%+ of managers operate from the Expert and Achiever logic in Torbert's system (E5 and E6 in Loevinger's). Both these levels operate from a self-generated model of the world which is essentially closed to non-confirming feedback in the case of the Expert and which evolves to accepting (forced) feedback at the Achiever level. If you couple this with the ability of organisations (especially those incorporating limited liability) to shield individuals from the consequences of their actions, the normal assumption-action-response-learning loop will be suspended and individuals fail to progress to the next level (where feedback is seen as valuable and learning becomes self-directed). <br><br>This theory also explains the complete absence of any systems thinking in most of the elites - this ability does not develop until the later stages. It nicely explains why some leaders are able to be transformational and most simply can't. It also squares with the research done in 'Good to Great' - the leaders of great companies tend to operate from the highest levels in this system (Alchemist), which then explains why the very same companies go back over once the CEO is replaced. <br><br>If you are familiar with Spiral Dynamics, these models trace the same development along the same axis, but in my view are more detailed and better tested.<br><br><a href=#c2257190260236187164 title="comment permalink">6/25/15, 1:39 AM</a><br><br>

Economic structure, technology, military tactics are constantly adapted between competitive powers as a response to success of other side.

Europe lost its power and became an ecomic unit based on trade with one currency. Total integration is idea, US of Europe. Chinese adapted to free market, russia to free market and democracy.

The theme common to the literature and philosophy of traditional societies is that we are all at the mercies of the gods (ie nature eg floods, plague, drought, famine etc). Humans have no control in this scenario, and they know it. They are inescapably tied to the vagaries of Nature. <br><br>BUT, if a society is wealthy enough, and enough of its sources of wealth derive from far enough away that local conditions don't matter any more.. then humans suddenly cease to be at the mercies of the gods. They HAVE CONTROL. And control is intoxicating. Imagine how exhilarating it would be, if you had always lived according to the vagaries of Fate, to know that you will not starve during the next drought..<br><br>I think that a desire for control may be part of the human condition. It is part of the ability to see pattern and impose order on chaos. That is how human society functions. But traditional societies impose strict limits on control, because the edge you have in a subsistence society is being able to respond intelligently to whatever Nature throws at you. In other words, you need flexibility, you need to pay very close attention to the very complex patterns of nature, you need to be constantly vigilant and thoughtful. This is very hard work, and requires enormous skill and high order thinking of every person in the community.<br><br>Control, on the other hand, is comparatively easy. If you think of society or the universe in mechanistic terms, only the person who designs the system has to think hard - everyone else just conforms to the pattern laid down by someone else. Our society is at once incredibly complex, but also requires almost no original thought from individuals. We are probably the most incompetent humans who ever lived. <br><br>So the strongest individuals in our modern, global, individualistic society have all the control - fossil fuels have meant that nature can be safely ignored most of the time. We have swapped our capacity to think and learn from the world around us for the tyranny of central control in a mechanistic society BECAUSE IT IS EASY. We have toys. We have control over our personal environments. And the capacity for clear judgement based on careful observation of the world around us has shrivelled from lack of use. Because control, or being controlled turned out to be too intoxicating..<br><br>You can see this in older, semi-global societies as well, like the Romans. They had a very mechanistic, controlling view of life. They loved hierarchy, and look at their feats of engineering to tame nature, and their arrow-straight roads. Sadly for them they couldn't achieve the total control we have due to lack of fossil fuels to exploit.<br><br>Well, that concludes my evening lecture; I need to go to a cheese-making workshop now. I must say, that even if you shoot my ideas down in flames, I just love the mental exercise that your weekly essays provide. They greatly enhance the capacity for original thought of my shrivelled industrial-age brain..<br><br><a href=#c41824611148294822 title="comment permalink">6/25/15, 3:03 AM</a><br><br>

It has some pretty obvious overlap with issues of power and oppression.<br><br>I have been overseeing a research project asking people about the experience of being a working person in the US these days. What is interesting is that although the client is interested mostly in workplace policies and regulations for improving working conditions - the problem that workers themselves come back to repeatedly is their anger at not being treated as human beings - at being treated as "numbers" or "robots".<br><br>And that comes back to the real underlying question that remains from your analysis - why are we so insistent at misapplying the machine approach in places where it doesn't work? You can treat the American worker like a machine - you can even re-tool the educational, entertainment and criminal justice systems to try to create robots - but (I sincerely hope) that's only going to create a brittle, self-destructive edifice. (One reason I gave up on academic anthropology was the growing sense that if I did contribute to our knowledge of how humans worked - that insight would be used to more firmly control people.)<br><br>I suppose the simplest answer for why we misapply "machinism" is in the adage that when all you have is a hammer - then everything looks like a nail - and so we have the sad and ludicrous sight of us whacking at the quicksand we're in with a hammer. How did we end up with just a hammer? I think that has something to do with trying to remove from the equation - surprise, creativity and ultimately uncomfortable realities.<br><br><a href=#c3457045079751281379 title="comment permalink">6/25/15, 4:29 AM</a><br><br>

I now have a much more pleasant term to use while pondering what they are doing/saying.<br><br>@JMG<br>I've been thinking about what to do about this behavior among adults for the past six months or so. Where I am at is that there is great distrust and dislike among us, sowed by the media (individual oddities and tragedies are played so much that they seem everywhere), and by our own schooling. The compulsion of school, curriculum, testing and constant ranking and sorting of children made us fearful of thinking on our own, being different, and made us accept as normal the lack of freedom and say in our own lives (an the ability of our parents to have influence in our lives as children - our own parents were powerless with school administrators and teachers). In families siblings are sorted and ranked different than each other and one is seen as "better" in the eyes of the school causing a riff in family harmony. We all know that what school counts as achievement - straight A's, captain of a team, club involvement - mean nothing in the real work of work and family. If those school achievements actually meant something, then everywhere we would forever be asked for our report cards and school achievements. As a society we fill children's lives with meaningless activity and then wonder why they grow up hollow, selfish, and mean-spiritied. <br><br>If Jesus command to "love one another as God loves you" does not spur people to different way of being with other people, I am at a loss as to what to do among the Christians around us. They feel righteous in their indignation and their lips move with constant negativity. Its clear they feel that something is not right in the world and they keep fervantly praying for relief. But praying doesn't bring real relief, action does. Jesus was clear on that. Feed the hungry, clothe the naked, free the captive, take care of the widow &amp; orphan - all doing, not talking. We are a nation of talkers.<br><br>I don't know if this happened everywhere, but in the three days after 9/11, people around here were incredibly caring. Everywhere I went with my then one year old, people were kind, took time to say hello, and helped each other. We were glad to be with each other. We were bonded together. <br><br>And maybe that is it - we have no bonds that hold us together anymore. We really don't need each other - food comes from the store, and it is checked out by a machine, kids now have iPads (which teachers and parents clamor for btw) and learn from apps, senile citizens go to nursing homes, children go to daycare, the poor are fed by the food bank, a visiting nurse takes care of the sick - all the work Jesus commanded us to do is paid work now. All of life is a transaction and once the transaction occurs, nothing is owed to anyone. No feelings of empathy, thankfulness, compassion required.<br><br>So I am still struggling with this and still looking to figure a thing I can do around it. All I do now is try not to get caught up in other people's stories about good guy/bad guy and keep associating with many different groups of people. In the meantime, we garden, raise chickens, homeschool, and enjoy the beautiful hop cones forming in time to brew beer in August.<br><br><a href=#c4342855019043284877 title="comment permalink">6/25/15, 4:48 AM</a><br><br>

At least in part, though as you know there are always many things at work. A good portion of the US “negotiation” strategy is simple hubris, the delusional belief that we are in a position of power so extreme that we need not worry about anyone else's concerns. You covered the reality of this well in Twilight's Last Gleaming.<br><br>Lately I have come to another understanding of so much of what we experience daily in the US these days, and I think it impacts on this discussion. People and societies can have genuinely differing views about things caused by background or ideology. These differences can be large enough to lead to wars, but it does not mean either side is necessarily lying – rather they can both have genuinely incompatible views. <br><br>However, if I stand in front of you and tell you something we both know to be false, and it is clear that I know it's false too, then something else is happening - it is about power. If I get you to go along with my falsehood, then you have surrendered the most basic liberty and allowed me to define your reality. The obvious falsity is not a bug in this negotiation, it is in fact the entire point. <br><br>Of course as you've described there are many motivations for all the nonsense that is going on now, but I see this power-projection tactic used often in the empire, in all manner of topics, both externally and internally. It is one of the things that becomes obvious when one has not watched TV for a long time, and then is subjected to it. The steady stream of obvious lies, often coordinated through multiple sources, cannot be an accident.<br><br><a href=#c6227866137008899250 title="comment permalink">6/25/15, 6:08 AM</a><br><br>

Only I would rephrase the thesis as, Distance from the natural world, creates this delusion of control and not necessarily only interacting with machines. By distance from the natural world I don't just mean farming or hunting, but from working directly with things in their natural state. So a woodworker who makes windsor chairs by collecting green wood branches and bending or shaping them by hand ( or even with a powered bandsaw) is totaly different than one who uses standardized sheets of particle board to make bookshelves. Or someone who heats up frozen food for dinner as opposed to the messy work of cleaning and preparing vegetables from the garden. I had just not thought of the fact the moving away from the natural world means an increasing reliance on machines, even though on further thought it is obvioius.<br> Perhaps this is why our society has not produced another Jefferson or Lincoln or that the last president who seemed to get it , despite some other flaws, was a peanut farmer. This effects ordinary people too, and not just the elites. It is just that the average american is not in a position to dictate terms to his employer, landlord or busdriver. A place you can see this effect is in choice of transportation. Going up the ladder in terms of distance from the natureal world ( and I am leaving out walking for clarity) we have the following. Caring for, hitching up, and driving a team of horses on a wagon is an extreme exercise in negotiation and cooperation between the horses and the teamster. Next up is riding a bike in an urban environment which requires cooperation with traffic, the weather, gravity, personal conditioning and canny attention to safe and unsafe routes on a real time basis. Then there is traveling by mass transit which requires subtile negotiation with time schedules, your fellow travelers and delays. Then finally there is the most common form of transportation in America ,the automobile, which can credit its success to the removal of interactions and negotiations with others. Perhaps more than anything else the automobile is making us insane.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c4672503686754839024 title="comment permalink">6/25/15, 6:22 AM</a><br><br>

Smile. I had a dream last night or night before. I had connected with former colleagues – vaguely biological science - in some modest little town on the edge of the Scottish Highlands under one of our mobile low grey skies, and was attending a presentation by Pope Francis in a small church / town hall. Somehow I could not visualise him, but he seemed radiant enough. Afterwards he was meeting ‘organisers’ et al (not me) back stage in the usual way. I caught a glimpse of an emerging Vladimir Putin who had just nipped in there to pay respects. VP nodded to a couple of respectably dressed unostentatious young guys standing at the back near the exit and unobtrusively but swiftly headed their way – busy guy.<br><br>And we headed out from this homely scene into the usual weather to do whatever it was our project had in mind.<br> <br>Note that we have a small and scattered Russian Orthodox community across Scotland and I was privileged to attend some months ago a small personal memorial service, held ecumenically in an Episcopalian Church. This though is the land of John Knox as well as of a significant Catholic minority, mostly originally migrant, and of the later Scottish Enlightenment; for example Hume &amp; Smith. These last two are the guys who got it wrong in fundamental ways – reason, utility, moral rules and the ‘passions’ and ‘sympathy’, and whose insights pervade much of our view of the world perpetuated in the crawl spaces of places of learning. if I read correctly: <i>After Virtue</i>; 3rd Ed 2007, Alastair MacIntyre suggests these H&amp;S formulations with Kant &amp; Diderot et al, and their successes and failures “are far more influential in history than academic historians have generally taken them to be.” He, AM, stands by historical enquiry to show whether his own argument and story-telling is misplaced. You.JMG, seem well placed in this regard to contribute to the enquiry.<br><br>I loved BTW Ray’s account above of sensitivity of conditioned young people – more difficult than 5 year-olds. “If they do not have command line computer code clear directions they freeze up like a Windows ME machine at the slightest disruption, and often proceed to do counter productive things until you find them and reset them to a new task. If you make the slightest sign of being able to perceive their dysfunction the judgment code triggers and things can go down hill quickly.”<br>best<br>Phil H<br><br><a href=#c6398008929753233728 title="comment permalink">6/25/15, 7:35 AM</a><br><br>

The politician behaving exactly like the criminal politicians ahead of him responds to the habit impulse and follows their example hoping to make it through and achieve success while success may still be had.<br><br>Americans interacting with machines all day long are indeed empathetically challenged but another analogy to machines is appropriate here. Americans are one of the least free people on the planet. They are driven by habit, rote and accepted pattern. That 'education' should be reduced to rote memorization is only to be expected. Responding to their habit impulse people feel free, they imagine themselves free, but true freedom is actually hard work. Predisposed to avoid work of any kind hard or otherwise, Americans the clever have sacrificed freedom to the pursuit of creature comfort, status, and the endless pursuit of entertainment. Freedom involves choices, hard choices, sometimes uncomfortable choices. It involves considering alternatives and alternative ways of looking at things. It involves rational thought.

The dehumanizing nature of service is precisely that it reduces a person to a more or less mechanical entity, deprived of the right to think and act creatively.

Read with the comments, one gets the hopeful feel that the owl of Minerva is indeed flying. The answer to whether we can make our complicated civilization "work" is No. The Chamber of Commerce is not interested in that answer. It took 9-11 to alter my world view of progress. My children; 11,9, and 4 would not grow up in the world I was familiar with. Who could imagine that people would cheer the tragedy in the streets? Well, maybe WE were not so innocent--that we were in some way complicit. So what lessons did I have for my children? What was the American Project? I thought perhaps it was helping establish a substantially just, environmentally sustainable, multicultural society. Is a grand civilization still possible? My answer is, not without sacrificial leadership. We obviously have not had that. Selfishness and pride are ancient vices but explain much of our current predicament. Leadership imagines that it can do both good and well. Elites have a vision that has gradually turned into a delusion. So how to politically wake up our clueless overseers? Would it help? or would waking from the dream send it all crashing down? Nothing is truer than that we need to at least wake up. <br> On a side note--I like watching your slow increase in members of the site. Two or three or ten new members is satisfying to see.

These aliens had been monitoring Earth for quite some time, waiting for us to wage thermonuclear war, after which they would swoop in and help us rebuild for which they would gratefully accept repayment (our natural resources). They told the hapless guy they were there to help, and could he explain why there hadn't been a war yet, unlike on so many other planets. Times being what they were, the author made the cold war nuclear stalemate into a human virtue. And the average guy made the aliens feel guilty by calling them vultures. They described themselves as a cooperative species rather than competitive like Earthers, and the image of themselves as carrion birds upset them so much that they dropped him off and left orbit. <br><br>Of course Earthers can be cooperative as well as competitive, but it does seem to be out of fashion right now. As you've pointed out we used to have all sorts of societies and benevolent organizations in the US, so I'm hoping that those sorts of 'machines' may be rebuilt. I doubt any aliens will swoop in to save us from climate change.<br><br><a href=#c929254823560439750 title="comment permalink">6/25/15, 8:42 AM</a><br><br>

Prior to all of the ditching, diking, and drainage that was done in the 19th and 20th centuries, a significant area of the Valley was under water for large parts of the year. The main mode of transportation for the Ohlone Indians was a boat made of tule reeds. Other areas were sage/creosote bush desert, and there was everything in between that can be supported in a Mediterranean climate. Bermuda grass and all of the usual introduced European annual grasses do very well in the winter months, along with a vast suite of range forbs and legumes.<br><br>The main thing agricultural development did to the Valley was in distributing the water, and a large chunk of the annual Sierra runoff, over a wider area and into the summer growing season.<br><br>Minor point, maybe, but it's one of my pet peeves when I see it referred to as such.<br><br>I also think the characterization of the call for a "right to water" a bit of a misrepresentation or over-simplification. Of course, it would be absurdity for anyone to expect for God or Nature to deliver as much water as a vast overpopulation demands just because we want it. But to expect a very complex system of water development and delivery, mostly financed by public monies, to be so managed as to deliver fair proportions to the owners of the system is not unreasonable, even if couched in terms of "rights" which admittedly make no kind of sense.<br><br><a href=#c7949191976588370006 title="comment permalink">6/25/15, 9:21 AM</a><br><br>

I'm an artist living through the End of San Francisco, and without my best friend "Thor" on here (James), i'd be strung out on whatever i could ingest and living under a bridge.<br><br>i've lost a lot of people to suicides. as most were artists, they were carried out suicides with quiet drama (drugs mixed together in a closed car parked on the side of highway 1 while watching the sunset) or explosive romance (a motorcyclist dressed in all her leathers and drove her motorcycle off the cliff and her body was later found stuck in a tree). i could go on. point is that the drama is short and forgotten or it leaves a bitter taste in all our lives. <br><br><br>i don't know about therapy these days, as i think the therapists are insane as they seem to be there to fit you into the status quo while barely making themselves in reality.<br><br>so do what you must and what you're here to do, but consider a LIVING SUICIDE.<br><br>i'm serious.<br><br>enough changed when i decided to live FOR james simply because it'd smear all his investments of love into me, and i knew it'd ruin his life with an inability to EVER trust loving anyone again.<br><br>living suicide as i defined it meant that all i'd "lived" for before was also dead. trying to make it in this society, and all the poison that went with that way of being and thinking.<br><br>so i had to cut EVERYONE out of my life and only let certain special folks back in after a time.<br><br>living suicide means for me that i'm not here as i WAS. something major had to change.<br><br>i'm protective of the people and ideas and jobs i take on now because this is a new way of living that gives the finger to the old way.<br><br>artists used to be good at flipping what was destroyed or dead or decaying into new things. we've been taught to stunt our powers so we spend our artistic powers wearing cute tutus and spinning on the coffee table for our parents into ETERNITY.<br><br>there's no god in "will you love me now?"<br><br>so do what you will, but i offer up another way to "check out" and stick around to enjoy the show. <br><br>i think part of the despair comes from this culture that teaches you you're NOTHING if you're not insatiably dancing on the coffee table in a tutu for praise.<br><br>a lot of us "who've considered suicide when the rainbow wasn't enuf" are still here because we loved the romance of suicide, but decided to put it off for later until we realized we were finally accidentally LAUGHING in the "later" and not taking ourselves so fucking seriously.<br><br>it's all ego. suicides of many kinds have at the core that childish ego hit of "they'll be sorry!"<br><br>and yes, they will. but they will go on and will have a scowl of rage at you for not hanging in there.<br><br>everyone's got it bad. i learned that when i had to stop hating the techies so much for ruining this city. and by techies, i mean ALL the ancillary stuff that comes with them and makes us slaves at their beck and call so's we can keep our tiny places to sleep another month. <br><br>it's all "ew" and no one's running off with any real cheese and laughing. elon musk? i look at elon musk and he's like a naked terrified baby, marrying girls who do it as a "fluke".<br><br>how SAD!<br><br>(continued...)<br><br><a href=#c8161304907704464536 title="comment permalink">6/25/15, 10:18 AM</a><br><br>

Full deadness is at one end of the spectrum and full life at the other. Not to pick on anyone, just my observations...full on deadness award goes to scientific materialism, which ultimately does mean that people are only machines, as even life is really a predictable interaction of chemicals. Consciousness is an illusion.<br><br>The Christian sects have some amount of deadness in them as well, despite the fundamental belief that life is real. The most obvious and, so far as I know, universal belief is that animals have no souls. Logically, the vivisectionists were right. If there is no soul, (consciousness) then who is in there really, to feel pain?<br><br>Various Christian sects believe that upon death, you go to sleep. Without the body, I do not know why they would sleep. And some believe that even in the afterlife and in heaven, we are not actual eternal beings, but only are kept alive by the will of God. Since existence itself, not contingent existence but real existence, would be the fundamental nature of God, I do wonder in what important sense do they think we are in God's image, if not in having a real soul?<br><br>My daughter visited for a few days. We went to the pond yesterday, and as we were leaving, my 35-month-old grandson said good-bye to the pond. My daughter said "It's a pond." I'm meaning to talk with her about that.<br><br>That Europeans in the middle ages did not think this way was news to me, that I learned from you. But it flabbergasts me that people can be so easily swayed to pick up new memes and thought patterns from, I guess, those they perceive to be in authority. One thing people do is, they find out that angels aren't pushing the planets (or, at least, there are forces that seem to be adequate to explain their motion) and thus assume that the cosmos is a dead machine, instead of looking deeper into the workings of things. This arises partly from compartmentalized thought, rather than holistic thought.<br><br>On the other hand, my spiritual mentor, a monk on Mount Athos, wrote about 80 years ago:<br><br>"Weep with me, all ye wild beasts and birds. Weep with me, forests and desert. Weep with me, every creature created by God, and comfort me in my grief and sorrow."<br><br><br><a href=#c2124314150780998723 title="comment permalink">6/25/15, 10:21 AM</a><br><br>

In a Smithsonian interview, Jaron Lanier referenced a story about a notoriously vile troll called Violentacrez who spent his days caring for his disabled wife. A female journalist confronted a troll who stole her dad's identity to torment her and his actions actually became clear to him. Their exchange actually revealed how his feelings of vulnerability led him to troll her.<br><br>http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/02/what-happened-confronted-cruellest-troll-lindy-west<br><br>I look forward to see how this hypothesis develops.

<div class="avtb a_ba2597" id=c8023052113771236269></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/11057583835126786240 rel=nofollow>Adrian Ayres Fisher</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Well done, sir, well done.<br><br>To continue the discussion re machines, it seems to me American education was always about creating workers who could fit a vast machine-shaped society composed of factory workers who literally became part of the assembly line machine, or women in secretarial pools, or cubicle workers: the emphasis on punctuality, rote learning, even, in the upper grades, changing classes promptly every 55 minutes. Only the shape has changed as machines and their requirements have changed. <br><br>It seems to me that some of the inability to comprehend "the other's" systemic change and response to changing conditions (aka learning)--or inability even to understand that something like that might independently happen in response to individual or societal actions--has to do with extreme materialism and reductionism that goes further than Newtonian mechanics and Cartesian duality. Skinner's behavioral psychology was a late-stage example of this: learning was not by volition and free will, but merely a manifestation of physical pleasure and pain centers, so if you controlled the source of pleasure and pain--the reward "system," you controlled the responses and "learning," and thus the outcomes--and the subjects--of your efforts. (American educators loved this.) Behavioral conditioning at its finest. In my view, though, logical, simplistic and wrong--but able to garner effects--<i>if </i> the subject is less powerful than the operator. Even though game theory has become popular in some arenas, this approach remains pervasive in many realms. A very bad kind of magic still employed by all kinds of powerful players.<br><br>If you apply that philosophical/psychological approach to "passive" Nature, ecosystem functioning and so forth (not to mention when dealing with other countries) and couple it with a denial of the inherent worth and capability of creative response of "the other"--well, we're beginning to live with the results now. And the kicking and screaming we're hearing from denialists as well as the technology-will-save us crowd is the kicking and screaming that those clinging to an outmoded paradigm always evince. None of the ecologists I know, nor the people in the ecological restoration circles I frequent would ever subscribe to the mechanistic/Skinnerian view. Nature is too dynamic, response to conditions too evident, systems thinking too vital to understanding process, biological boundaries too blurry. Maybe Nature is starting to practice some operant conditioning on us?<br><br>I write this as a person who appreciates machines, well-made tools and mechanical systems, though I understand an oak woodland savanna better that the processes that brought me the excellent tempered stainless steel soil knife I got for my birthday or the laptop on which I'm writing this. And with the ecosystem in question, not actually all that well--it is a lifetime of study.<br><br>I, too, admit to enjoying the squirming of the faux cons regarding the encyclical. I am in the middle of reading "Laudato Si" right now. The moral and spiritual components involved in caring for the earth, linking earthcare and climate change with environmental justice, critique of modern economics and the more logical interpretation of the bible (the living Earth is a gift to be cared for not destroyed in the name of "dominion")? Speaking as a Quaker, duh!--or as you say, common sense. Collapse now and avoid the rush!<br><br><a href=#c8023052113771236269 title="comment permalink">6/25/15, 11:16 AM</a><br><br>

He makes the same point as you do, that there was a shift from universe-as-interconnected-being to universe-as-machine. He connects it to Newton--he explore's Newton's psychological history, and argues that he became increasingly rigid--perhaps borderline autistic--in wanting to cram <i>everything</i> into a mechanical system. Berman also discusses Gregory Bateman's theories on schizophrenic-type thought as being produced by double-bind conditioning--damned if you do and damned if you don't.

And the reality that matters to humans is very much the complex natural systems of which we are a part and for which our genetic signatures were selected. <br><br>Despite the ubiquity of the human-influenced environments most of us find ourselves in, scratch their surface and uncontrolled, natural systems are driving them. Beneath the bureaucratic gridlock of our governments are the primate status negotiations that lurk within all human interactions. Behind the impressive veneers of our monumental architecture are the continuous stresses that inexorably urge all building materials to return to ground level, the same stresses that the Babylonians and Chaldeans tried to keep at bay long enough to build up their artificial environments in their day. <br><br>We interact with natural systems all day, every day, but our secular religion of humanism requires us to deny their power over us and to vaunt our imagined power over them.

Complementing such delusion seems to be outright "stupidity" in multiple American and European institutions. This phenomenon has greatly worsened in the last couple of decades and is now just plain unbelievable! I just can't get my mind around it, and i appreciate your trying to help. How can this phenomenon be accounted for? "Delusion of control" is part of it, and you are on to something when you speak of a hypertrophied mentality of mechanical control as a mode of thought importantly involved. But this is an elusive and complex thing which deserves deeper analysis and discussion.<br> The delusion of control you speak of involves having a purely, or primarily instrumental orientation of the mind, it seems to me. Can't instrumental thinking crowd out other types of thinking in certain circumstances? Can't instrumental thinking erode value commitments and exclude an active imagination? Imagination involves seeking out and seeing alternatives, using alternative terms and metaphors, and formulating questions in an enlarged context. Alternative strategies for thinking and dealing with changing situations are handicapped by an atrophied imagination and exclusively instrumental (how do I fix the status quo in front of me) mentality. The exclusive use of the validity of technique and the machine as a predictable means of controlling, first, natural processes and then, many other things to achieve economic and political ends is what instrumental thinking is.<br> A slippery subject.

Namely, the Imperial Wealth Pump. It has, as you have noted in previous essays, been the source of irresistible power on the world scale, and irresistibly tempting wealth at home. The maintenance of the wealth pump is the primary concern of the American Imperial State and it's overseas vassals. But, as pumps are wont to do, the Wealth Pump is tearing apart debtor nations at an alarming rate, and menacing recalcitrant outsiders into circling the wagons. <br>At this point though, there's nothing to do with the Pump but Pump: the thirst is too severe, the victims too anemic, and anything short of full tilt sucking will be a wasted effort. The choice is between putting down the Pump, and draining down to the bottom.<br>Putting down the Pump is a non-starter. The largess and glory it brings have addicted its constituents. The job of the presidency, the state department, the IMF, at this late day, is to keep the Pump working as hard as needed; it is quite outside their powers to suggest it be turned off. <br>So the Greeks cannot be offered compromise, as that would involve taking our fangs out of the victim. The Russians and the Chinese cannot be bribed or accommodated, as that would involve sharing already thin porridge, not to mention empowering the nation that might be next on the menu. That the fattened goose of the environment is stripped down to the bones cannot be discussed in polite company, as no festive mood could resist the palling thought of the end of the feast.<br>It's not that doubling down is the best strategy, in truth or the minds of the players.

We are indeed standing at an historic moment, when machines can acquire the capacity to learn... and yet the ability to reach that ultimate goal of industrial society is precis ely what will cause its downfall : far from projecting us into a cornucopian future, automatization has completely upset the usual way by which society distributes wealth among individuals. The way I see it, rampant automatization decreases the availability of productive labor for humans, and therefore the wealth produced will have less means of being redistributed among the majority of individuals.<br>Besides, as you pointed out brillantly in this week's essay, trying to automate everything must ultimately lead to automating your own behaviour. Somehow having machines assisting us to take decisions would be like always using a wheelchair whereas your legs were perfectly valid. The muscles would end up atrophied, and so would our brain functions.<br>Overall, that illusion of control tied to the machine-oriented worldview may also explain why the subjects you discuss in your other blog are so fascinating and yet so subversive to a person living in an affluent industrial society : the idea that there are forces in the cosmos that you cannot bind and control to machinery is very subversive, and yet the fact that there might be forces hidden from our everyday perceptions is also a means of escaping from all the frustrations engendered by an industrial lifestyle.<br>Which is why I always wonder, why have some areas of science got to be turned into cash crops ? If the machine learning community was just pursuing a philosophical goal of general AI, it would make for a fascinating hobby and it would constitute a great collective project, like reaching the Moon. Maybe that is so because it is not a subject matter where backyard tinkerers can excel... Instead what we have got is a glut of startups, each trying to come up with its own derisive application of really advanced AI concepts to really mundane tasks. Interestingly one of the main drivers behind the glut is marketing, which would benefit hugely from machine learnign advances.

For a country with so much geography, this is remarkable to say the least. For instance, when our youngest daughter was in 6th grade (Massachusetts public school), she had received less knowledge of where to find American cities than I had at her age, and I was born and raised in a European country (Netherlands aka Holland). Names of rivers or mountain ranges were a big unknown to her. Nothing was done on topography of other continents. Most Americans I have met during the six years that we lived in your country, did not know where Holland was located. Was I from Poland maybe? Did I like Danish pastry? (from Denmark, not Holland) Was Holland north of Spain? (well, yes, if you forget about France and Belgium) Is Holland maybe an island next to Iceland? I had to say that I was from Greater Amsterdam to make myself clear.<br><br>- a lack of practical knowledge of the world outside the American borders.<br>Americans used to travel a lot (seventies), but this is no longer the case. Many of them have never or hardly ever left their country. For those who do travel, safe options like organized trips are preferred over more adventurous options. As a result, there is very little interaction with the locals, and very little to no understanding of the couleur locale.

Where my mind goes, and where I've recently begun to wrestle with the problem in my own way, is the figure of Prospero. (It might be merely a function of my interests that I regard the Shakespeare canon as the mythic axis for English-speaking modernity, but I honestly can't think of a better place to start looking.)<br><br>On the one hand, Prospero is the answer to the question which is Dr. Faustus (consider their names!), an answer earned with twenty years of bitter struggle by the greatest artistic spirit the English world has produced. I am disinclined to propose that a better answer could have been found. But! The Tempest portrays a world that is *entirely* within Prospero's command-- being exiled with nothing but his magic, he has ousted the witch Sycorax, enslaved her unruly son, and bound the powerful flower-storm genius of the place. The action of the play, so unlike any other Shakespeare in this respect, is never outside Prospero's control: he orchestrates a mystical wedding of perfectly prepared and positioned elements, with the intent of effecting a "brave new world," healed of its trauma and immunised against unruly evil. That is, if taken literally (a troubling caveat!), a machine-world.<br><br>So what to do with this figure? I think we can agree that Prospero-the-machinist, Prospero the heroic technocrat, stands as the paragon of a spirit that in the present day must be viewed as evil, for the reasons you're articulating. But to my mind it is actually very difficult to credibly cast Prospero as a villain, especially in light of the whole canon. For one thing, simply rejecting Prospero does nothing to address the evils he mastered-- you almost inevitably end up reconstituting Prospero as the answer, or worse, regressing to an inferior version of him (Hamlet or Macbeth, say). Another tactic, which you could say post-modern political thought has generally tried, is to take Prospero's island as given but to critique Prospero's rule from the perspective of one character or another. Someone will, in effect, inhabit Sycorax or Caliban or Ariel or Miranda or Ferdinand (or Trinculo!) and ask why Prospero should be in charge. But for a couple of reasons that should be evident, that again only reconstitutes Prospero, so is no answer.<br><br>What is especially interesting, given what you have written this week about learning, is that the Prospero we actually see on stage is not a magician: he's an educator, even a gardener of souls. This is perhaps the beginning of a way to reimagine him-- while taken literally he's an image of the Faustian Will dominating a machine-world, from another perspective what he portrays is that Will wholly directed towards an interior and moral purpose, with the effect that upon surrendering his books and staff he is at home in the world rather than alienated and damned as Faustus was.<br><br>A related path, which I'm sort of exploring, is to imagine that the protagonist of the Tempest is not Prospero at all, but rather the hidden magician who tells us the story of Prospero. A concealed Merlin, if you will. This involves a certain amount of working backwards-- not regression exactly, more like reconstruction, in that there are figures and scenarios in the just-previous romances that suggest what the secret protagonist and his modus might be like. (Spoiler alert-- in a word, surprisingly druidy.)<br><br><a href=#c8389924844022206117 title="comment permalink">6/25/15, 4:31 PM</a><br><br>

I hope the Greens keep on hammering on that issue, and bring it up over and over again whenever the Liberals try to push their agenda on religious grounds. <br><br>Ed, of course -- the US, or one or more of the successor states that occupy its current territory once the present mess is over with, could well stage a comeback fifty years or a century down the line. History's a tangled web; that's one of the reasons fantasies about the US as the permanent hyperpower are so misplaced. <br><br>Jo, I think that's certainly part of it, but I'm far from sure that's all of it. All empires get obsessive about control; not too many of them insist that the whole cosmos ought to be subject to their will. More on this as the discussion proceeds!<br><br>Les, congrats on the farmer's market! As far as the feedback loop, though, most countries in the world are nowhere near as compliant as Australia, which in some ways never seems to have gotten over being a colony. There's a selective logic in Washington that sees the Australia-like countries as normal and everything else as unacceptable, and I'm not sure that depends on there being a lot of examples of the first class. <br><br>Leo, I suspect if property owners couldn't write off losses from unleased properties, they'd be a lot more interested in cutting deals!<br><br>M, stop right there. "Civilizational arc"? That's the old delusion that everyone in the world is destined to become like us.

Yes, you have to start from the recognition that the cosmos has its own order, which is not put there by human beings, does not exist for the convenience of human beings, and may not even be fully comprehensible by human beings; once you grasp that, you have a shot at the humility necessary for survival in the real world. <br><br>Adualism, of course there are grades and degrees of intelligence; so? There's a rough though inexact correlation between degrees of complexity and grades of intelligence, which is why a functioning democracy tends to make fewer really stupid decisions than an autocracy does -- autocracy is a much simpler system, thus contains far less institutional intelligence. <br><br>Luna, excellent! You get this evening's gold star. Yes, that's been my take on conspiracy theories for a long time now; they're a way to avoid the far more terrifying possibility that nobody is in charge...<br><br>Denys, interesting. I'll put it on the get-to list. <br><br>Lou, true enough. The next question is how to help people snap out of it. <br><br>Twilight, that's a good point, and a fascinating one. At what point along the spectrum of Enlightenment culture did we make the transition from elites who believed their own hype to elites who deliberately manipulated falsehoods in the way you've outlined? <br><br>Clay, I think that's an important suggestion -- that it's not simply interacting with machines, but the entire artificial environment that does it. Since the built environment -- machines included -- consists of human concepts projected into the world of experience, those who spend their time mostly interacting with manufactured things are literally living inside a solid hallucination, a world from which the natural order has been excluded in order to impose an arbitrary human order on it. Hmm. <br><br>Ahavah, thank you! Yes, very likely that's in there. IIRC Moshe Idel has written something on the origins of the golem legend out of Cabalistic mysticism; I'll have to see if I can find that. <br><br>Foo Bar, have pity on the poor cats! I couldn't bear to see one condemned to live with a politician... ;-)<br><br>Ed, ah, but notice what the Greek legend of the Trojan horse implies: "don't trust a machine, it's probably booby-trapped."

These days, far more often than not, "political engagement" means that you get to be coopted into the service of someone else's craving for unearned power. <br><br>Dave, since the climate is pretty seriously spinning out of control at this point, I don't think that's likely to be a factor. <br><br>Over the hill, of course; the whole notion of rigid determinism and the denial of free will is an invention of what, a few centuries back, used to be known as "the mechanical philosophy" -- the belief, new and controversial in those days, that the cosmos was nothing but a giant machine. When you hear someone insist that free will doesn't exist, btw, look around and you'll usually have no trouble finding the behavior that person is trying to excuse.<br><br><a href=#c5016802781760053660 title="comment permalink">6/25/15, 6:06 PM</a><br><br>

I am not going to try to speak to any specifics of your situation, because I do not know them, but I can only offer some of what I have learned in the time I've been here in this wonderful thing we call LIFE. I will be 63 years old on Saturday. My hope is that I get to live a few more years and learn a little more each day. I am third from a family of seven children--the second died in infancy. My father was a WWII veteran who came down with severe PTSD which started ten to twelve years after the war. The stress of his condition eventually drove my mother into her own cycle of depression and two decades of amitryptline, which was way too long for her to have taken it.<br>I came to know finally as an adult that I too had suffered from depression when I realized that I had made a hard-and-fast decision at age ten never to become a father. My family was always going to be my birth family. I now care for my two brothers, one older than I and the other younger, who are both disabled and housebound.<br>A little more than a year ago, my doctor had me on medications for blood pressure; a statin drug; and a SSRI. I made the decision to come off the drugs and I have. I educated myself, I changed my diet and my physical routine and the last BP reading I had was 124/72. But by all means get active. Try to do at least one thing each day that you have really loved in the past: have your favorite meal; take a day trip; visit a friend you have not seen for a while; love an animal.("For a person who has never loved an animal, a part of the soul remains unawakened." Anatole France.)<br>I now take minerals that are almost non existent in the SAD(Standard American Diet) because the soils have become so depleted in the last century. Take magnesium; potassium; selenium; and zinc everyday. Never take iron; copper; or calcium unless you consult your doctor.<br>I know the above sounds like meddlesome advice of the overly concerned, but now for what I really want to say: I came a long time ago to the realization that I loved the "Soul", for lack of a better term that is within me. The way that I relate to that soul confirms the duality that pervades the philosophy and history of our culture. I was certainly brought up in the Christian sensibilities of the rural South, but I have never practiced any faith. Allow yourself the space to honestly assess your deepest concerns for yourself and for the the human race. To be honest, that concern is why we are all readers of JMG's amazing essays of the current state of the world. Despair could overwhelm us all if we allow it. Despair can become the solitary companion for those of us who tend to be "solitary souls". Constant learning and striving is our task. There are doubtless people for whom you will become an indispensable source of advice and counsel in the future we are about to enter.<br>All the Best<br><br><a href=#c6040070262831570140 title="comment permalink">6/25/15, 6:42 PM</a><br><br>

Since the built environment -- machines included -- consists of human concepts projected into the world of experience, those who spend their time mostly interacting with manufactured things are literally living inside a solid hallucination, a world from which the natural order has been excluded in order to impose an arbitrary human order on it. Hmm."<br><br>IMO this is an essential insight. I grew up in the mostly artificial environment of mid-century suburbia, but my parents paid for two weeks of no-frills Girl Scout summer camp every year, and then a high school friend and her father took me on a couple of long backpacking trips in the High Sierra, where the hand of man was visible only in the trails we walked, the trail signs, and the stuff we carried with us. On return from any of these ten day to two week trips, I always experienced some culture shock, as the comic strips, all the printed advertisements and most of what the people around me were concerned with seemed completely pointless. <br><br>Any immersion into a radically different physical and cultural situation is likely to have that effect when one returns. What kept it from totally wearing off me is that after several post-trip repeats (and perhaps some marijuana), I realized that the entire built environment of a city and the culture that creates it and keeps it running is functionally a Disney Fantasyland or a stage set taking up a tiny corner of an immense real world, way beyond human scale in every direction. Also that it is no use telling people this as long as their entire life experience has been within environments that are mostly built or modified by human beings. What you inhabit and interact with every day is what is real to you, even if it's a maximum security prison or a royal court.<br><br>Most people cannot grasp that their material surrounding are exactly what you call them, a solid hallucination, until they get well away from it long enough to stop looking at it, imagining it and pining for it, and start paying attention to the parts of the physical world that human beings did not build. Until the night sky is the visible cosmos, not a couple of dim stars glimpsed between buildings, and the animals and plants around you are carrying on their lives without much interest in you.<br><br>People who live in huts and tend goats are probably not under the spell of this illusion. City dwellers live in a double or triple dream. The first dream is the one all human beings are born into, the habits our minds use to make patterns out of sense impressions. The second is the built environment, to the extent it screens off the natural world. The third is the stories our culture and art tell us to make sense of our lives, or to comfort and distract us. Waking up even momentarily from any of these dreams requires either a sustained effort of will or the equivalent of a loud bang.<br><br><a href=#c4263759271202323854 title="comment permalink">6/25/15, 6:45 PM</a><br><br>

I knew of this geoengineering scheme before, but what surprises and frightens me is the economics of it: a couple of billion dollars a year would be enough to offset a large portion of additional global warming, provided the scheme is kept up in future years.<br><br>He does concede that there are huge uncertainties, that the correct approach is to start small and scale it up, that an abrupt stop to this scheme would cause extremely rapid climate change, and that done poorly it could drive down global precipitation, perhaps even disrupting monsoons and endangering billions of lives.<br><br>To me, it is a no-brainer that this "medicine" is worse than the disease, possibly much worse. But the idea of geoengineering the climate is catching on rapidly among the technophiles. As a really blatant example of machine thinking being used where whole systems thinking is required, it's hard to beat geoengineering. It's so cheap that any significant nation could do it unilaterally, as could even a single multi-billionaire.<br><br>As denying or ignoring climate change becomes impossible in the face of reality, I think we're going to see the implementation of a lot of Very Bad Ideas like this one and the rapid nuclear buildout that you depicted in Star's Reach.

In our fossil-fueled global society we can control more of our environment than any society before us. The US is currently the empire at the apex of the pyramid of control, and also, coincidentally, occupying that position at the very moment in history when we also have more control over the environment via fossil fuels than any historical society. In effect, we have harnessed nature, it is now one of our many client states.<br><br>Often those at the apex of the control pyramid are blindsided by world events - look at how surprised the French aristocrats were to see that guillotine being set up, or the British who couldn't imagine that its colonies weren't completely delighted to be exploited.. I don't think the US is unique in any way in that respect, but it is unique in its opportunity for actually having a good crack at bending the cosmos to its will.. over the last fifty years it has been able to do exactly that in many senses of the word - harnessing a billion years of sunlight will do that for an empire. Its mistake is not realising that the conditions of its dominance cannot possibly continue - but you are all over that..<br><br>But if an empire which dominates the whole world creates an artificial environment for itself in which it is cocooned in every way from the reality of the limits of the natural world, then the arrogance of an unassailable empire is coupled with the conviction that its control extends over, not only other nations (therefore they may be safely ignored) but also over nature (therefore it may be safely ignored as well). <br><br>In order for the US to open a dialogue with other nations, or with the natural world, it first needs to cede its place at the the top of the control pyramid, step out of the machine and acknowledge that neither world politics nor nature is obliged to fall in with US interests..<br><br>The alternative is a rude awakening when it is toppled by both.. <br><br><br><br><a href=#c4415757440183872809 title="comment permalink">6/25/15, 8:18 PM</a><br><br>

I'm a little late to the party, but in regards to Clay's critique of your hypothesis - I think the key is the degree to which your experience is mediated by machines. You've touched on similar themes before in these pages so you've probably already had this thought, it may just need adding to this particular hypothesis. Our perception through our senses is already one layer of mediation of what I will call for now raw reality. Riding in a car is a layer of mediation in that you are traveling around in a protected, climate-controlled environment at inhuman speed. Cinema, TV, computers, and smartphones are another layer of mediation, and the ones that are the most threatening, because they pose as a sort of toxic mimic of a real environment. All of these put an additional layer of mediation on top of our perceptual mediation and therefore put us at additional remove from raw reality, which is part of their toxicity; because it seems most of our spiritual sentiments try to address the fact that we cannot reach that reality, much less comprehend it. To varying extent all motor-mechanized environments and especially those that create virtuality are toxic mimics, in that they mediate reality to too great an extent or attempt to replace it wholesale while at the same time creating bi-products (pollution, sedentarism, etc) that threaten the body's existence within reality. Even being indoors with artificial lighting and climate could be considered a toxic mimic.<br><br><a href=#c4281208355860155147 title="comment permalink">6/25/15, 8:40 PM</a><br><br>

The uninterested one's ain't observing." I immediately felt like it might tie back to this conversation.<br><br>A machine is still a system, and therefore still able to learn, interested in the world around it. It participates and is subject to the world is all that really means. But it is designed such that it is extremely limited in its interests and the ways in can interact with the world around it are all determined to a very high degree. It has only one right answer to the question "how do I live?" every other answer is a malfunction. Malfunctions, learning to not do their assigned function, are all they can learn, if what you are working with acts like it is learning, something is wrong with it says machine logic.<br><br>This, to me, explains a gradient in the effect that you are describing which I feel like I preceive in relation to class, the wealthier one is the more likely on is to interact with Machines that haven't learned. This lap top I am using has learned all kinds of weird tricks, I have to negotiate with it, deal with it, and care for it, because the thing is breaking and only connects if I follow the right rituals and superstitions. The boss's computer next to me is new and well protected from any undesigned for change, it is obedient. Mechanics are constantly dealing with the weird behaviors that machines prove themselves able to learn, many of which are mystifying; all the better for mechanics. Apple users are nearly completely hidden from this, and encouraged to upgrade often before their machine learn to be free of their prewritten fates.<br><br>This logic requires the absolute rightness of the one answer in the machines design. Machines don't just serve us, the must do so in an unsurprising way. It requires machines to be disinterested systems, isolated and alone except for the assigned imputs and functions. It implies that users will become disinterested systems, because (if the mechanics keep the machines tamed) they only need to mind known imputs and functions. This isolation and aloneness, this separation from whole systems means a civil machine is a solipsist.<br><br>Controlling flows of information is the most essential thing to be able to make machines, each effect must be carefully protected from any unintentional cause. Doubt, suspecting toward any unknown source of information. How did we learn to doubt so?<br><br>There is an idea of there only being "one answer" which I think play a big part in all this. That objective truth thing. Where did we learn the notion that there is only one right answer? That is is wrong to be interested, involved, in other answers.

The basic problem goes even deeper: it is the way that humanity has taken up technology and its development according to an undifferentiated and one-dimensional paradigm. This paradigm exalts the concept of a subject who, using logical and rational procedures, progressively approaches and gains control over an external object. This subject makes every effort to establish the scientific and experimental method, which in itself is already a technique of possession, mastery and transformation. It is as if the subject were to find itself in the presence of something formless, completely open to manipulation. Men and women have constantly intervened in nature, but for a long time this meant being in tune with and respecting the possibilities offered by the things themselves. It was a matter of receiving what nature itself allowed, as if from its own hand. Now, by contrast, we are the ones to lay our hands on things, attempting to extract everything possible from them while frequently ignoring or forgetting the reality in front of us. Human beings and material objects no longer extend a friendly hand to one another; the relationship has become confrontational. This has made it easy to accept the idea of infinite or unlimited growth, which proves so attractive to economists, financiers and experts in technology. It is based on the lie that there is an infinite supply of the earth’s goods, and this leads to the planet being squeezed dry beyond every limit. It is the false notion that “an infinite quantity of energy and resources are available, that it is possible to renew them quickly, and that the negative effects of the exploitation of the natural order can be easily absorbed”.[86]"<br><br><a href=#c3267930550988368893 title="comment permalink">6/25/15, 9:03 PM</a><br><br>

You and I are constrained in what we can spend by living within our means. If we spend more than our income we eventually go bankrupt. Likewise for local governments, e.g. state, city, county, territory, etc. These municipalities’ spending is constrained by their income. They must either raise taxes, or cut spending, to balance their fiscal budget.<br><br>I think we both agree on this. What is counter intuitive to this accounting principle is it does not apply to federal governments that issues their own currency. Such governments do not need to balance their budget, cut spending or even collect taxes, plus they will never run out of money because they create in the first place.<br><br>Inflation, you say. Of course you can have demand inflation when an economy overheats – business is great; hey, let’s raise prices. But, we are talking about supply inflation from too much “money printing”.<br><br>Japan, the poster child of money printing, just can’t seem to generate any kind of inflation, and investors are willing to accept a paltry 1.46 percent on Japanese 30 year bonds. Here in the US, it was estimated that banks, since 2009, are bailed out to the tune of $12,000,000,000,000 – wow, that’s a lot of zeroes ($12 trillion). Additionally, since 2003, our wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are reported to add an additional $2 trillion to our deficit. Overall, the US has a $17 trillion national debt. Where’s the inflation?<br><br>When did you hear Grandma say, “I wish the government would pay off its debt so I can get rid of my savings bond?” In actuality, Australia and the US have no intention of ever paying off their debt. Our children and grandchildren, along with institutions and pension funds, will happily hold government bonds, just as Grandma does, today. As a practical matter, governments only need to pay the interest on its debt, which can easily be paid from tax receipts.<br> <br>OK, you say, this can’t go on, we are headed down the wrong path, it is unsustainable, and there will be hell to pay in the future. Unfortunately, you only give vague generalities, such as increasing weaknesses, other actors, and unnamed policies, so I am unable to address your concerns specifically. However, I have heard many similar above arguments since the 1960s. I have seen YouTube video of politicians as far back as the 1940s saying the same thing. At least they had a point, since the world was on a gold standard and you needed that commodity to balance your books. Countries, such as Greece, who no longer issue their own currency, are basically on a gold standard within the framework of the Euro. Greece’s spending is now constrained just like any municipality, or you and I. They must take the austerity formula of cutting spending and raising taxes.<br> <br>When people claim “money printing” causes inflation, they are only looking at the supply side of the supply and demand equation. What happens when a central bank creates demand for money? During the 1970s the US experienced high inflation, at one point reaching double digits, with many claiming inflation was out of control. Our Federal Reserve (central bank) radically raised interest rates creating a demand for US dollars, causing a recession, which brought inflation back down to acceptable levels.

Bateson's double-bind theory, on the other hand, is highly relevant -- though some other aspects of his theory of schizogenesis may be even more so. <br><br>Christophe, that's an excellent point. The artificial environment thus functions as a kind of screen obscuring the real workings of nature -- at its peak, perhaps, in the artificial worlds of TV, video games, etc., where the natural processes involved (mostly lots of electrons moving around) have nothing in common with the wholly fictive world being presented to the viewers. <br><br>Matthew, yes, this is another way of talking about the same thing. The entire project of this blog, you know, is basically the working out of a single thought, one that's complex, counterintuitive, and forbidden enough that it's taken years of work to begin to parse it. <br><br>Moshe, of course! It's part of the fantasy that machines never make mistakes. Tell that to the Blue Screen of Death sometime...<br><br>JR, excellent! Yes, it has to be approached historically, at least in part -- or at least that's my natural bias. But it also has to be pinned down in the present, in thoughts that we all recognize. <br><br>Jason, good. I wonder if anyone there will realize that what's really nonnegotiable is the need to break out of the maze of abstractions and deal with the real world for a change. <br><br>James, that's a good point. It also fascinates me that so many people expect machines to do whatever they want and then get so furious when that doesn't happen. A Batesonian double-bind at work? Possibly. <br><br>Agent, but you'll notice what happened to Gilgamesh when he tried to apply the same sort of attitude toward the gods of nature. We've lost the sense of human limits that pervades the epic of Gilgamesh. I should probably do a post about him, for that matter -- most people don't realize that the poem is among other things a savage critique of his original state of arrogance. <br><br>Unknown Deborah, the devil's bargain that Christianity made in the early modern era -- giving the churches control over people's minds and the state control over their bodies and wealth -- precludes that. If any pope were to try to proclaim an economic system other than the one we've got, you can bet that Catholic churches would lose their tax exempt status in a heartbeat.<br><br><a href=#c7398260497134344152 title="comment permalink">6/25/15, 11:44 PM</a><br><br>

Didn't you get that memo? <br><br>Troy, makes sense -- the upper and middle classes of what you're calling the Anglosphere (would "the inhabitants of Gringostan" be a suitable synonym?) are the only people who've benefited more than they've lost from the existing order. Much of the screaming right now comes from the fact that some members of the middle classes are being thrown under the bus; they watched all those other people go the same way, but managed to convince themselves that it couldn't happen to them. Oh well...<br><br>Revelin, you're welcome and thank you -- but I've got to confess I've hated that Brautigan poem since I first read it, which was quite a few years ago!<br><br>Jeannette, the fascinating thing is that this level of geographical ignorance is not that many decades old. Schoolchildren in the US as a matter of course used to learn US and world geography in detail: "Name the capital city, major rivers, and important agricultural products of Hungary, and three countries that border it" used to be the kind of question you got on grade school tests all the time. It would be an interesting exploration to find out when and why that got dropped like a hot rock. <br><br>Rita, good heavens -- I'm delighted. I hope they find <a href=../../2013/12/a-christmas-speculation.html rel=nofollow>my blog post on the subject</a> useful. <br><br>Cherokee, that's the question -- what has caused an entire culture to be afflicted with a set of behavior patterns normally found in a minority of mentally ill people? <br><br>Stuart, nicely framed. The thing about Prospero, of course, is that once he's gotten what he wants, he dumps his books overboard and quits the wizard business, in a way distinctly different from Faust's method! The place I'd start tackling the question you've raised is by looking at Prospero and Faust in the context of varying attitudes toward magic in the culture of the time, and seeing what third option is being neglected in the binary that unites those two. <br><br>Sgage, hmm.

Most pundits have focused on the idea that the Catholic Church has now taken a side in this controversy – which sounds strange to me, since there isn’t any controversy among scientists, and the Church has been speaking out on environmental crises since at least the 1980s, and on valuing Nature for centuries. In the ugly world of media pop culture, of course, climate change remains controversial and the 1980s were a long time ago. It reminds me of a few years ago, when I read articles that the Church had “come out” in favour of evolution – with which, of course, it had never actually disagreed. <br><br>To regular readers of this blog, of course, Laudato Si contains no new information or insight, but it’s gratifying to hear that the leader of the world’s largest religion (arguably) is putting his weight behind them. Moreover, the largely non-religious media class often ignore the fact that the pope isn’t just another celebrity; people devote their lives to their faith. <br><br>Largely ignored by most media was the fact that the encyclical dealt with many other ecological issues, predicted a difficult future, specifically expressed scepticism of techno-fixes, called for a return to moderation and austerity, and had strong words against inequality, individualism, consumerism and many other aspects of modern society. It's not a radical departure for the Church, but it’s an uncomfortable read for all political factions in the US today. <br><br>As for people treating the world like machines, I would only suggest that it’s more specifically the virtual world of computers. People have been using machines for centuries without experiencing effects to this extent, because clockwork mechanisms and copper wires still employ the laws of reality – ignore them and you lose a limb, or your life. <br><br>In recent years, though, modern Westerners have spent more and more of their lives staring at glowing rectangles – televisions, then computers, and finally hand-held devices – and gave most of their thoughts to the increasingly vivid world on the other side of the screen. Today, many people I know explain thoughts and feelings though references to video games or other virtual realities, and the remaining newspapers have been systematically redesigned to resemble web sites.<br> <br>If I may inject a personal note to the group, I will be visiting the United States next month, and will be in Missouri and Minnesota in July and August; anyone on this list who would like me to give a talk to their group, or just meet, feel free to e-mail me at briankaller@yahoo.com. <br><br>Finally, Happy belated Solstice, JMG.<br><br><a href=#c8628855916208672632 title="comment permalink">6/26/15, 1:41 AM</a><br><br>

Last night I started to suspect that the earliest form of this issue I could think of was the concept of heresy. If that is the case the extreme imbalances that this demon we are trying to name come from a pathology of trying not to be a heretic. The engine the idles up or down at any cause other than the throttle I control is an insufferable heretic. The materialist who sees the Universe as a machine must limit what inputs they count as valid to maintain that conclusion, all other inputs are forbidden.<br><br>Now it would be very easy to run with this into some grade school hating on the Catholic Church's history, but I think that would miss a deep point for the same of hooting at a primate out group. So please don't, mirroring the same heretic shaming behavior back to the Church is what I suspect triggered the depth of recursion needed for the Western Machine to take over our dreams.<br><br>Learning something heretical is the biggest malfunction one can make. Learning something according to central dogma, already fixed and itself no longer learning (either in a book or in the vivisected nature), is learning to function (as a... Catholic, muffler, graduate student, ambassador, secretary.)<br><br>The Catholic Church's wiser member have long had more subtle forms of these concepts, but I fear that the group tied all too tightly to Europe's power structure at the time leading to the reformation used crude forms of the concept which once folded over by the convulsions of that time birthed the bad spirit you are interested in to counter spelling. The fact the the Catholic Church has always, and this week most wonderfully) been very wary of modernity I think also indecated that the Machine is from the reformation's formative event. I hope the Pope can cast a counter spell, if he were to hit just the right notes hard enough, I think he is better placed to nit the root than some other people...<br><br>I wish I knew more about the way that belief and religion were so closely tied in the west, and how and why that differs from other cultures.

Here are some very sketchy thoughts. <br><br>As detailed in Parker's book on the period, <i>Global Crisis</i>, the 17th century was a time of extreme weather, failed harvests, war, revolution, migration. During that period a third of the human population of the world died--disease, starvation, war, lowered birthrates--the usual horsemen that lie in wait for social disruption to occur so they can ride in.<br><br>I believe that to many people, the whole order of things--of Nature--had been completely upended. The 16th century had been one of favorable climate, good harvests and population expansion. Now disaster. So what to do? The earth is smaller than expected and no longer the center of the universe. The music of the spheres falls silent. Europeans discover they can colonize and subjugate whole peoples. You've got the human-centered ideas of the Renaissance swirling around, God is apparently not doing much for anyone, and the Catholic church has been successfully revolted against. <br><br>Bacon's ideas about nature in which he explicitly says (I forget where) something like <i>if we can learn nature's secrets we can better control her</i> get very popular among other natural philosophers. And don't forget he was writing at a time of unparalleled English wealth and power, prior to the civil war and other 17th century disasters. There must not have been any perceivable limits--English exceptionalism, if you will. <br><br>Then with 17th cent. upheaval, there is very good reason to try to exert control, since the usual methods are not working. And, empirical scientific method does get results! Successful experiments do give an apparent confirmation of power and require an objective, even amoral, attitude to carry out. The idea of "objective truth" becomes redefined. Then, why not flip from investigation to application? Why not create machines--enhanced tools--that can do things for us, much as our slaves do things for us. Why not use guns to kill people--so much more powerful and efficient and less up close and personal than the sharp implements and blunt objects used previously. (At least in theory: at the time, American Indians' bows and arrows are much faster and deadlier than Europeans' slow-loaded, single-shot matchlocks.) Think of the wealth and power that can be gained!<br><br>So maybe in the 17th century there is a unique confluence of factors--material, cultural, religious and philosophical-- that had not existed before that give rise to this new complex of notions that removed God(s) from the functioning of the universe and put humans (mostly men) at the center of things to experiment on and do what they would with the newly inert materials around them. Scientific method run amuck!<br><br>People do seem to have been aware that this was happening, at least in some quarters. William Penn and others, while very interested in natural philosophy and promoting scientific education in the young, warned against objectification of Nature and people.<br><br><a href=#c3612536218191790586 title="comment permalink">6/26/15, 7:45 AM</a><br><br>

Capital cities were a bonus. I think it is important to note that I attended school in Texas at that time. Different states, and different locales should have different educational requirements, if regulations were being followed (and I do know Texas likes to show off their independence so they were probably different). <br><br>It would be interesting to note some regional differences in educational requirements. When I moved to Northeast Minnesota in 1998, I found education was FAR behind what I learned in Texas but if I had moved to a more populated area, maybe I would have had different requirements. That said, the teachers adapted well, and gave me the great option of reading and writing essays about various American authors, since I'd already studied US Literature. I'm really curious about education, and the future, when comparing small towns versus big cities..<br><br><a href=#c3647275345837969289 title="comment permalink">6/26/15, 8:33 AM</a><br><br>

The non-negotiating malfunction displayed by the U.S. is because we are the most extreme manifestation of the mechanist, capitalistic culture that started developing in the West 400 some years ago. As for why it's the U.S. in particular, look at the lands the Europeans conquered or took over during and after the Renaissance. Mid-continent N. America was quite simply, the richest in various resources, including a disproportionate amount of fossil fuel, and we were the first to exploit oil. Australia and Canada were easy to conquer, but lack much in the way of agricultural land, same with S. Africa.

I don't have any immediate family and when my friends and acquaintances drift into virtual reality it is a real nightmare. I had conversations at the time, trying to point out that all talking sounds like a menu, a multiple choice, a set of channels. Acronyms and categories and a reductive, pseudo-rationalism was the norm. Of course, nobody knew what I was talking about because I was talking to people who had been absorbed by their machines. Eventually I had to go even further to the edges, the periphery, where people were still skeptical and intuitive enough to have their own thoughts. <br>I have always liked the concept of "edges" as an all purpose metaphor. Edges are where the animals and edible plants are, along the edges of watercourses and fields. Edges of the mind are where the most interesting thoughts are, as the most aware and interesting people are on the edges of society. And peripheral vision is where you see motion, or anything unusual, in the woods. Along the edges is a good place to be.<br>In the mainstream, it now seems impossible to have an unrehearsed, self-aware conversation. Almost everyone resembles a little, self-contained bureaucracy.

I also have a friend who has just asked me to help review his phd thesis. I see you are still grappling with this idea somewhat, one distinction he held, and I wonder what you think, is a delineation from a machine like a toaster and what he calls a computational object, which is essentially a machine that portals into a abstractions and models. I.e. a computer or ipad that connects to whatever model is being rendered, whether a statistical chart, controller for a factory machine, or social media web site.<br><br>Fwiw, I agree with you. My last synchronicity is that I recently came out on top of a long political fight at work with a former superior. His way of managing and doing work or issuing directives is primarily through machines, which was causing headaches for everyone, and my more human centric approach is what tipped the resolution in my favor. In retrospect, I now see some of his more outrageous behaviors and actions as a consequence of me not behaving according to the script he tried to program me into via his machine. Just a fascinating thing to think about in the context of your post. I don't think the machines are a causal mechanism, I think its our way of inhabiting them, and I think its primarily machines that affect abstract changes at issue, such as computational objects, rather than machines that affect material change, like a lawnmower.<br><br><a href=#c5839446587654353952 title="comment permalink">6/26/15, 11:57 AM</a><br><br>

It basically states that because God made us caretakers of the planet according to the Bible, we have to take care of the planet and of our fellow humans. Nothing revolutionary, but it appears to be too much for some ( like a friend of mine used to say ) "baby bath Catholics" ( people that just consider themselves catholic because their progenitors asked a priest to wash their heads when they were children ). On the other hand, I've seen some Dawkinesque "atheists" that only a couple of weeks ago would spew venom about the Catholic Church historic meddling with scientific results are now cheering Francis stance. Oh well, tribal thought is tribal thought ...<br><br>On Greece, well, as I'm in one of the countries in Europe that is in line for the chopping block Greece is and , while the situation is far more complicated than you probably see from that side of the Atlantic ( the Greek governement also wants to have it's cake and eat it, just like the Bruxelles Eurocrats ), the situation is pretty much what you say, to the point that apparently just yesterday Ms Merkel stormed out of the reunion table, fuming in how Germany would not be blackmailed by the greek governement. Yeah, the exact same person that called the Greeks lazy bums and that mused at a time about Greece paying up the debt in Ionian islands ( while at the same time stating that the WW II war reparations that Germany still owns to Greece will never be paid up ) ...<br><br>More, the whole situation is made worse because the "IMF" loans that the EU gave to Greece were actually paid mostly by the other EU countries in dificulties ( say, Portugal ) as a requisite for those countries to receive "help"as well ( or did you though that Germany and France would spend their own money to bail out those half-Arabs of the south ? Nah ... let them bailout eachother with the money they don't have ) and those countries are counting with those loans being paid back for themselves to not default , so if Greece defaults the IMF loans pay up, there will be other 3 or 4 more Greece-like situations popping out. As you can see we also have in this side of the pond people so convinced of their power over the reality that think that broke people ( that they indirectly or not have made broke, mind that ) can get out of debt by loaning money between them and that it will even be enough leftovers for cashing out some for themselves. Rove would be proud :D <br><br>And to end, about your musings about the increasing tendency to see the world as a machine-like contraoption ... well, it is just good and ol'Reductionism and TBH while the current European strain is as you say a product of the breakdown of the medieval Scholastics into the modern Scientism ( not Science because, let's be honest, people that that think that anything in Nature is like a simple machine clearly never worked with either Nature or machines ( especially complex machines made in cold northern Europe in far warmer climates :D ) and thus they don't deserve to be called scientists ... ). As you already talked in other articles in other words, societies in crisis tend to start defining everything to the lowest denominator terms and a simple machine model is the lowest complexity model you can find for anything. It is the same process that ended making the poorer strata of a lot of societies little more that their job, to the point that they didn't even had names and were only know for their ( most likely hereditary ) job ( like in late Rome or in Sengoku Jidai Japan ): I don't care for what is happening inside that black box you call head ( like Skinner would put ), for me you are just a walking tool that makes a job... that let's be honest, is the same thing that looking at a forest and simply see a bunch of wood-making machines that also release oxygen and have some marginal side benefits like harboring game ;)<br><br><a href=#c9184284251831361603 title="comment permalink">6/26/15, 2:52 PM</a><br><br>

Traditionally, that us-other mentality allowed one group to co-opt the power of another group by the normal means. Conquered people would be subjugated and the upper class would go about ordering their servants with the belief that their control was more-or-less absolute. Now this standard didn't include the non-human world (expect possibly domesticated animals) because the non-human world was clearly out-side of the control of ancient technologies. So there was the non-human world that could not be controlled and the human world, divided between the controlled and the controllers. Keep in mind also that the controllers were a rather small sub-set of the population and so the delusion of control was limited to a very small portion of the population. <br><br>Fast forward to the dawn of the industrial revolution, where two things changed. The first was a world view that placed nature under the dominion of man (the whole abrahamic thing), the second was the gradual emergence of technology that could actually “tame” nature. Now we all know that technology couldn't actually tame nature, but it provided a very visible facsimile of control. Oceans that were once highly dangerous became easy to cross, land masses could be crossed in days when once it took months or years, whole rivers dammed and diverted, eventually we learned to fly, and caused whole deserts to bloom. Even with all of these changes we still viewed the world as given to us, and thus parts of it were to remain outside our control. While all these technological changes were happening we also began to understand the forces of nature. Sicknesses were caused by bacteria, rain by the hydrological cycle, and so on. The once terrifying and mysterious forces of the divine stopped being mysterious and lost some of their power over our psyches. And why not? We could understand them and we were increasingly able to mimic the forces of most of the elements, couldn't we to some degree tame them? As the industrial world entered it's post-religious phase our power seemed to grow and amplify, all thanks to our machines. And who built, and who controlled the machines? Not god because there was no god. <br><br>The unexpected part was how far the power spread, before only the rich had access to so much power. Suddenly even a middle-rung worker had access to more wealth and power than they could dream about. The delusion of control spread. All because they, or we, were the masters of the machine. We started worshiping our tools because the gave us control over the greater machine (nature). We always worship the source of power, and we always imitate what we worship.<br><br>Nature became the barbarian other and we sought to control it the way we've always sought to control the barbarian other. We fear the machine rising up, whether in the form of AI or crazy weather patters (there are as many of the latter in pop-culture as the former), because what else do oppressed servants do? We convince ourselves that we control the machine, and if nature is a machine then surely we must control it. The barbarian had to be civilized, or mechanized in this case.

The earliest evidence of bipedalism (Sahelanthropus tchadensis and Orrorin tugenensis) is older than that - 6-7 million years - but the earliest *good* evidence (Ardipithecus) is about 4-5 million years. You could argue that bipedalism can't be proven until the Pliocene, but it would definitely be very early Pliocene, not late, and I'd tend to go with the late Miocene. That's actually one of the more settled issues in the field at the moment; *why* our ancestors became bipedal is another question...<br><br><a href=#c1426971021306107725 title="comment permalink">6/26/15, 3:52 PM</a><br><br>

AKA mistaking the map for the territory, and a lot of other conceptually similar phrases. I love puzzles, but puzzle reasoning usually doesn't work in the real world.<br> <br>For instance: the Ultimatum Game, an economic research game where one party apportions an offered reward between themselves and another party, and the second party either accepts the deal for both parties or rejects it. In the latter case, neither party gets anything. In theory, the second party should accept any amount as better than nothing. But in practice, the second party's judgment of the apportioner (e.g. as "fair" or "unfair" and thus deserving of reward or loss) will often cause the second party to refuse "unfair" apportionments.<br><br>The blind spot in ones whole-system assessment is usually oneself, as a participant in the scenario who others will react to, rather than as the isolated decision-maker from outside the system as ones mental model might be assuming.<br><br>The most common flawed assumption in American geopolitics appears to be, not specifically that other parties cannot learn (though that's part of the Puzzle Illusion), but that they will consistently choose based on their own supposed "rational self-interest," which includes accepting a poor option if (though whatever circumstances or machinations) all the other options are even poorer. The lessons of the Ultimatum Game (and history) suggests otherwise.<br><br>By the same limited-scope reasoning, one guard with a gun might be able to keep a crowd of fifty at bay, based on the "first to step forward dies" threat. But it doesn't always work out that way! The one (or ten) who steps forward might not be thinking of his own cost/benefit ratio, but his grandchildren's, his cause's, or his gods'. Or he might be too angry to think at all.<br><br>(A recent personal lesson/parable of the Puzzle Illusion, courtesy of my dog. After many years of being nonchalant about thunderstorms and other loud noises, she started getting increasingly skittish and distressed by thunder. Based on common pet training advice, I wished neither to reinforce the nervous behavior by coddling her during storms, nor increase the stress by punishing the nervous behavior in any way. So I would act as if nothing at all was happening, and wondered why after so many years she'd become so fearful in the first place. Then one long sleepless stormy night, I had no choice but to think harder about the situation from her point of view as a perceptive conscious being. Looming large in that point of view was me. In short, what was distressing her was that she could hear the thunder and yet I was acting oblivious to it! No wonder she was stressed. That she would be concerned for my mental state was my blind spot, and that realization broke the dilemma. Now, when there's thunder, I say specific thunder words to her so she knows I know, and she's much calmer.<br><br>Of course, that lesson learned, I'm thinking about what I should be saying to the thunder...)<br><br><a href=#c6125895347354459659 title="comment permalink">6/26/15, 3:59 PM</a><br><br>

As an elementary teacher (I know how you feel about public school, I do my best), I can tell you that it was just about the same time the schools started getting wifi, the internet, and more machines in the classroom. After all, why memorize the capital of Tennessee it you can look it up on your phone in a few seconds. Apparently, the children’s minds shouldn’t be filled-up with such trivial knowledge like 6x6=36 or why we celebrate the Fourth of July. We’ll see how that works-out when there isn’t internet, and no one knows any facts. Also, teachers haven’t figured-out what we’re suppose to teach instead, or we have to keep school fun and memorizing facts isn’t fun (who started this school had to be fun?). Basically kids are learning less than when we didn’t have the internet and machines in the classroom.<br><br>Standardized testing in 3rd to 11th grade has changed somewhat for the better with Common Core standards in California and about 38 other states. There are less multiple choice questions on the test, and when there is one, the next question will be based on how you answered the previous question. So if you got the wrong answer on #6, you’re going to miss #7 too (hard on the kids, but it does push some of them farther). There’s also a lot of typing answers to questions and a person reads / scores them (I think it’s a person). I predict the scores will be very low in CA and there will be calls for reforming the test or forcing teachers to teach to it (already happening in NY).<br><br>Not related, but I’ve been following the reports of a strong El Nino still forming in the South Pacific. It is still predicted for this coming fall/ winter which should mean rain/snow for California (that’s what caused all the rain in TX). Hope spring eternal in California and if not - east of the Mississippi here we all come! ;-)<br>Carl<br><br><a href=#c6648671475881252835 title="comment permalink">6/26/15, 5:37 PM</a><br><br>

It was wealthy in natural resources and independent of old ideologies, and it grew up into nationhood just as the industrial revolution really got going.

I learn from you. I love that. This is a uniques corner of cyberspace. But this week you have all hit it out of the ball-park! I've been reading and rereading the essay and comments to mentally keep up. Awesome!<br><br>1 of 2<br>I fully agree with Jo. The inputs for control came before the machines themselves: I think the development of, utilization and dependence on machines grew sort of organically out of the utilization of pre-mechanized tools. The machines just made work that much easier. It's just as likely that our ancestors created machines specifically simply for the benefit of creature comforts, tho make life easier - THEN found an intoxicating exhilaration in the power of having overcome. <br><br>Why this was the way forward for Europeans, (and before them Persians?) probably had to do with their circumstances - not as much spare workers (as in Ancient Asia, to do things manually. - why invent a tool or machine to do what the peasants are already doing for less?): yet not enough easy abundant natural resources to keep doing things the old way, (as with Native American Tribes - why invent machines when we've got everything we need?).<br><br>However- this history is just one thread of the braid.<br><br>I think JGM, (and other commenters) is absolutely right. 2nd thread of the braid. Living with those machines that have made our lives easier from a basic survival POV, but has changed our perceptions. The power then conferred to more individuals was exhilarating and addictive. Seemed like such a great idea that we expanded the mechanical idea to systems, cities, non-mechanical entities, ……. but: not only at the cost of practical day to day dependence on them; also, unforeseen, at the cost of fully changing our perceptions of our world and surroundings. "Thinking-outside-of-the-box" today almost always means coming up with a new way to do a thing. It almost never means questioning, "Why do that thing at all?"<br><br> 3rd thread of the braid: Completely altering our offsprings' perceptions of their world and surroundings. It's one thing to live in the generation that invented the machine and get quite lazy and used to it, but you do remember how things were done before. It's quite another to have been born into the machine age with no experience of life without this tool and dependence on it.<br><br>This dependence has grown hand in hand: Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think in early industrial days, anyone USING a certain machine had to also have at least some basic knowledge of how to maintain it and fix it when it broke. I remember back even in the 1970's USA, most people, (mostly men &amp; boys - it was a guy thing) HAD to know basic auto-mechanics. A fairly complex machine, but they had to know at least the basics ,no matter their socio-economic background. That was societally expected. A lack of this knowledge was unmanly, shameful. (Was it in the 1908's?) High-schools stopped offering home-Ec. and Auto shop as it was seen as degrading to encourage kids into blue-collar jobs. So Jiffy-Lube and similar services came along to fill that need. Dependence was no longer considered unmanly or pathetic, but a sign of higher status, "I PAY people to do that for me"- the average driver now cannot change their own oil, adjust their brakes, clean a carburetor, (do any cars still have these?) shave the points, put air in their tires, etc… It is not expected. Dependence is expected. <br><br><br><a href=#c7472434101270070706 title="comment permalink">6/26/15, 5:52 PM</a><br><br>

But consider the difference between the adult who climbs into the wheelchair out of laziness, and stays too long - to the child born into a wheelchair with no experience of life without it, even told they are lucky to have it - only peasants walk! Pffft! The adult can remember and analyze the positives and negatives of the wheelchair. They may remember how to walk and build their legs up again. It's always an option. The child may not even see any advantage to climbing out. That option is much more elusive. Their dependence far more entrenched.<br><br>Now the most alarming thing, IMHO: is that my children's' and students' generation is far further removed from self sufficiency.<br>We boomers, (I'm 54 years old) grew up in suburbs, (please bear with this generalization), isolated from the bare bones of the real natural world it's challenges and skill sets- most of my generation can't farm or ranch or hunt or build our own houses. As Denys has said: many of us can't even entertain ourselves - we have mastered no musical instruments, or developed these non-mechanical entertainment skills. I don't remember a time without TV - instant entertainment - the boob-tube as my grandfather called it. Yet we still had to master SOME skills connected directly to our own benefit and survival - we had to clean our carburetors, fix our toasters, cook, etc… Most importantly, we had to master the interpersonal skill of communication, some level of patience, diligence and deferred gratification. The boob-tube only had a few channels. Cartoons were an early Sat. morning thing ONLY. To see a good movie or hear a good band you had to go out, (at the very least to by the album). Patience and delayed gratification.<br><br>And our current Elites and leaders are largely from this generational level of dependence on artificial world. A 'middling' level, if you will.<br><br>My children and my students OTOH: have never experienced a world without cel-phones and computers - their perceptions of interpersonal communications is fully shaped by absolute instant gratification, instant and constant availability, (but little actual communication), entertainment and 'knowledge'. lack of tangible "hands-on" skills or complex interpersonal conversational skills. They are dependent on machines that approximate thought for them. As some previous commenters have said: with zero expectation of how to fix those machines when (not if) they break down. With far less experience in patience to wait for the answer, the music, the conversation with your friend, (which isn't an actual conversation, but a sound-byte text or tweet). And worryingly, it will probably be in their generation that we experience massive disruptive collapse, and lose all this fun stuff. <br><br>How will they survive? (OK, yeah. I think we all know. I think that's why we're here at ADR).<br><br>Thanks again.<br><br><a href=#c5232344710965389949 title="comment permalink">6/26/15, 5:53 PM</a><br><br>

Your post got me onto a number of lines of thought, including a little classification for learners and their cousins:<br><br>Learning as a complete process requires 1) the capacity to continually discover new information, 2) the capacity to remember it, and either 3a) the capacity to creatively respond in a useful way or 3b) the capacity to uncreatively respond in any old way combined with an outside way of removing bad responses. Most machines and other bits of dead, disconnected matter don't do any of the three- they have a kind of memory, but without (1) they cannot have (2).<br><br>Intermediate between rote memorization and learning are systems that have (1) and (3a), which I would call instinctual systems. These include plants, insects, and some computer programs (e.g. chess-playing computers). They can all simulate foresight, but since they lack (2) they will not notice or respond differently if they make the same mistakes over and over. Instinctual systems are universally the creations of preexisting learning systems. A different kind of intermediate system would be one that throws out unpredictable responses without suffering any feedback from its previous responses, due either to lack of memory capacity or to complete insulation of its memory capacity from their effects. I can't think of any perfect examples, but the climate is close enough. To the extent that it has a memory, it is buried several layers of causality down inside the species that affect it, and so the changes involved (not in the climate's behavior, but in its memory) are too slow to register on a human scale. Neither kind of intermediate system is susceptible to the same kind of exact control as the proverbial well-oiled machine, but the difference between the two varies widely. A potted plant is as easy to control as a slightly malfunctioning machine. A plant in the garden becomes part of a larger system and is no longer as easily controlled, but it is still more manageable than, say, the climate.<br><br>On to the learners! There are (3a) learners- individual humans and animals- and (3b) learners. Species are the simplest (3b) learners, with heredity and selection playing the important roles. From this follows that (3a) learners are also parts of (3b) learners. A bunch of learners put together form a second-level learner. If the units are (3a) it is called a community and operates by a mix of (3a) and (3b), if they are (3b) it is called an ecosystem and operates by (3b). The community or ecosystem's capacity to learn is completely dependent on its members' capacities, and in particular their capacity for learning how to respond to challenges that threaten the existence of a coherent whole community or ecosystem. When that capacity decays in the members (by atrophy or destruction of the ruling class in a community, by removal of some members of the whole in an ecosystem, and by changing exterior conditions in both cases), the larger system's dysfunction threatens the survival of its members and also releases the creative energy which were previously tied up by the community/ecosystem (energy that had been maintaining infrastructure and social relationships in the one case, and been locked into holding down a single evolutionary niche in the other). This creative energy eventually finds a solution, but since it is undirected (or in the case of invading barbarians and the like, even destructively directed) it requires some pretty hefty learning to restore equilibrium. I'm not sure about every step in this, but I think it is what you are getting at with idea of the biosphere itself learning.<br><br>Incidentally, the Space Bats Challenge story that I'm (slooooowly) working on touches on the theme of mechanism versus creativity, but with a couple of those ideas' usual partners swapped around. This post and the comments on it might well influence it….<br><br><a href=#c2518262879971556284 title="comment permalink">6/26/15, 7:05 PM</a><br><br>

Perhaps because I am familiar with machines (the older mechanical variety and the newer electronic ones) I really never saw a "machine" and anything other than another tool. Perhaps a more complex one, but a tool nonetheless.<br><br>It seems to me that the concept of machine evolved to encompass the limits of human awareness. We humans can't take everything into account, so we draw artificial limits on what we think is important. The tool we come up with that deal with this limited set of reality is our machine. It works OK much of the time, at least in the short run (after all, many of your posts deal with the ways these human limitations are failing). Well enough that these simple machine have enabled the building of more complex ones many times over during the last century or two. <br><br>Still, all the machines people make and use are just tools. Complex enough now a days that most do not understand how they work, or what the limitations and exclusions were in their design. But still just a tool, not really all that different than a screwdriver.<br><br>It seems that we have gotten so enamored with our creations (machines) that we have forgotten that they are based upon a limited/truncated view of reality, and instead chosen to try and stuff the whole of reality into our slimmed down model. Perhaps this was possible because to so many, machines are a mystery or a form of magic. If most people understood the limitations inherent in their machines, they would be less incline to use them as a model for all of reality.

That's why I want to track the thread of the idea."<br><br>Insofar as the aspects of our dreams reflect aspects of ourselves, the desire to control nature would be a desire for ultimate control over our human nature and our instincts, which was in fact a powerful motivating fantasy of early Christianity, especially Gnosticism. While the Roman world often personified, celebrated, and exaggerated our animal instincts through Bacchanalia, orgies, vomitoria, etc., early Christians as often expressed their driving ideals through mortification, abstinence, stylitism, etc. <br><br>The Western dream of controlling human nature must have begun morphing into its externalized counterpart of controlling nature herself sometime before Humanism seemed to spring full-formed from the exhumed head of Zeus during the Renaissance. Ockham and the late Scholastics seem like a fertile place to begin digging for clues. Perhaps glimpses of inspiring Muslim technologies during the Crusades helped this exceptionally divergent dream to coalesce so quickly.<br><br>What then led all the potentialities of this exciting new dream to precipitate during the Enlightenment into the rigid waste we now know as scientism, industrialism, capitalism, etc. is another interesting piece of the tapestry. The horrifically topiaried formal gardens of the Enlightenment certainly give witness to biophobia having been baked into the cake for quite a long time now.<br><br><a href=#c8422324664970536825 title="comment permalink">6/26/15, 11:52 PM</a><br><br>

A possible reason could be that generally speaking reasoning about a system becomes exponentially harder the more interconnected the parts in the system are, ideally it is easiest to reason about system which can be easily divided up into smaller subsystems which are largely independent to each other, (this ties into NP-Hardness). Furthermore I will suggest that if we consider the problem of how to optimally interact with the natural world, it is much easier to come up with a conservative (I.E. takes less from the natural world than you could theoretically get away with) solution to this problem which is unlikely to lead to serious problems than it is to come up with truly optimal solution (I.E. one where humans take as much as they can possibly get away with.) which achieves the same goal. Thus I will hypothesize that with the coming of the age of reason Man found that His previous interaction based upon old traditions were not based upon reason. When Man proceeded to reason about the new method of interaction He found that He had to make some simplifications about how exactly nature worked in order for that reasoning process to be tractable (Possible to be carried out in a reasonable amount of time). Upon changing mans relationship in this way Man found that He suffered little to no direct consequences for His actions and thus could feel assured that the old traditions which kept Him in check were merely based upon superstition. Unfortunately He has now found that the consequences for his actions have a lag time which He failed to account for. Similarly I would suggest that the state department found that pushing China/Russia around had no consequences, in the short term.<br><br><a href=#c8638996824348018916 title="comment permalink">6/27/15, 3:10 AM</a><br><br>

But in the realm of facts it reverts to a state of nature, in which it alternates between long submissiveness and brief angers that for all the bloodshed world-peace never diminishes that alter nothing. Of old they shed their blood for themselves; now they must shed it for others, often enough for the mere entertainment of others that is the difference. A resolute leader who collects ten thousand adventurers about him can do as he pleases.

It appears to me that an uncritical belief in one's invincibility essentially is, given a long enough time frame, identical to utter defeat and devastation.

The right hemisphere is sensitive to the particularity of context, and vigilant for sources of uncertainty. Interpreting different historical periods in terms of the relationship between these modes of being, McGilchrist construes modernity as a period in which we have been so successful in constructing a world which is the product of the left hemisphere's invention that we live in a 'hall of mirrors' which repeats what we think we know while obscuring the reality of which we remain unaware. <br><br>My account does not do justice to the book itself, which is a genuine masterpiece.

QE differed by preannouncing the dollar amount and term (duration) of those assets to be purchased, hoping to reduce <b>long term</b> interest rates. All this is available to read on the Fed’s web site.<br><br>The procedure is straight forward, although I simplify for clarity. An investor purchases a Treasury Security. The money used to purchase this security already exists. In exchange for his money, the investor now owns an interest bearing asset as opposed to his non-interest bearing asset (cash).<br><br>During QE this process was simply reversed. The investor traded his interest bearing asset back into cash. What you have is asset exchanging. There is NO money printing. Think of it as transferring money from your checking account to a savings account, and then back into your checking account. This is why there wasn’t any inflation, as so many direly predicted.<br><br>I presume Mr. Hockey is pushing a political agenda for austerity.

I am now reading "Cosmopolis" by Stephen Toulmin.

Newton's machine approach to the cosmos fell on fertile ground, because the alternative was the war of all against all (at least in northern Europe). So, the demon's name is Fear.

And we have seen another ghastly terorist act on our soil... It made me wonder, maybe the era of pretense ends when people become aware that they are pretending ? It takes a few impacts like what we have faced this year... And I also get the feeling that there will be no actual response involving changes in our lifestyle, just people keep doing whatever they are used to do but trying to do it more cheaply. Then it takes a charismatic leadership to inoculate deep structural changes in our society, when we will enter the era of response.<br><br>So I wonder, are we doomed to be aware of each area only after we have entered the next one ? It feels like we are going through History blindfolded stumbling with our hands extended forward...<br><br>One thing is sure, our abstractions here are no longer working. Today I went to a small city's shopping center, opened on a Sunday... for no particular reason, if you consider the potential customers to be the main reason why you'd want to keep a business open. Then later on I heard the sound of the streetcar's bell, right before the Cathedral's bells rang. One sound made from a set of electronic chips, the same everywhere, but not easy to explain how it was made, and the other produced by a simple albeit massive piece of mechanics.<br><br>My educated guess is that the next Napoléon will have to enforce a set of economic policies that help restore a sense of connection between the products we buy - or did buy... now they are too expensive - and who/how/where they were made / what they were made of. Local industries are now a thing of museums, but if we want to rebuild a striving economy, we need to rebuild the trust in that same economy, and local will have a high trust value.<br><br>Another thing that I see is the energy of the youth, failing to find collective projects to be invested in other than self-gratification and sports. This is where educated guesses about the future do call up the usual, F-word suspects of the 20th-century authoritarian regimes. Hopefully we don't need another round of fascism to focus our energies on the hard tasks at hand.<br><br>So abstraction is certainly a big part of the delusion of control, and automatisation is one of its corollaries. The future economic orders of the next decade will have to channel not only the people's energies, but the power of abstractions as well, and quite a few other occult forces (trust, nostalgia...). This goes way beyond the number-tweaking that currently passes for economic reforms, and again the fear of a charismatic leadership hijacking the process comes to mind. Western Europe is not exactly a poster child in turning away from authoritarian regimes in times of societal stress...<br><br><a href=#c7875979426404583322 title="comment permalink">6/28/15, 3:41 PM</a><br><br>

Sometime about 6 years ago we got off on to the topic of reductionism. We quickly realized that reductionism itself is not bad but often quite useful. What we observed over the next 5 plus years was how often we would catch each other during our conversations with the comment hmmmm that seems reductionist. It was frightening just how pervasive reductionism had become in our core thinking without our realizing it. <br>I am a mechanical engineer and appreciate machines for what they can do. I also fully understand their limitations. It seems to me, based on my experience from conversations with Doug, that the problem is not machine thinking or reductionism it is allowing that logic to become the sole means of thought. I suspect that part of its attraction comes from the many advances in understanding that reductionist science has provided. A bigger part is the illusion of control. Most modeling is significantly reductionist and can create the idea of control within the model, machine based thinking and control may exist within the model but it is far too easy to forget or ignore the limits on the model and expand that to a control illusion beyond the models limits. <br>The American way has embraced reductionism to the exclusion of other modes of thought. Another aspect of my learning from conversations with Doug is how many ways the culture we live in supports reductionist logic over other possibilities. Again it is not that reductionism is wrong it is just wrong to use it exclusively. Our American industrial culture has become so isolated from the natural world that it can enforce reductionist thinking as the only logic allowed. This combined with the hubris of this culture and its insistence on being the greatest and in charge of everything has supported the use of linear reductionist models for everything to the exclusion of other approaches. If it doesn’t fit the excepted reductionist model then it can’t have an effect and can be ignored as you will be for bringing it up. The reason interaction with the natural world works so well to help people out of this state is you cannot, in my experience, successfully interact with the natural world very long on reductionist logic alone and survive. In my lifetime, I am 66, I have seen our education system swing hard this direction in an effort to create human machines to fit in cogs in system. It frightens me. My sons have expressed to me how little their friends know in terms of how to do anything or get along in a natural setting. <br>Tomxyza<br><br><br><a href=#c2555807735874234721 title="comment permalink">6/28/15, 5:15 PM</a><br><br>

The next generation will know less about the machine, and the generation after that even less. The skills to operate the machine safely may no longer be taught (or <i>learned</i>, which is not exactly the same thing). The resources for maintenance may become scarce. As long as the machine runs on its own momentum, life (with the machine) is good, but when the time comes to update, repair, or adapt to new operating circumstances,... sometimes it's easier just to start over.<br><br>In this context, the "machine" can be a municipal water system, a nuclear power plant, a manufacturing business, a financial business, a church, or even a small farm.

Still, the same sort of blindness has been applied to nature for a very long time; more on this as we proceed. <br><br>Revelin, that's a fascinating question and deserves some prolonged thought. <br><br>Twilight, I certainly remember the shift, so you may well be right -- which would support Brian's thesis that computer technology is what pushed us right over the edge into complete detachment. <br><br>Keith, good. Yes, that's a useful addition to the puzzle. <br><br>Ray, the religions that came out of the Roman and immediately post-Roman Middle East really are strange, when compared with the rest of the world's faiths. The fixation on formal creeds, the habit of responding to disagreement with extreme violence -- the source of those oddities does call for exploration, which I haven't really pursued yet. <br><br>Adrian, that makes a great deal of sense, though of course correlation is not causation, and environmental determinism also has its limits. <br><br>Prizm, I was in the fourth grade in 1971-2, and had to learn the names and shapes of the states and where they were located. More detailed geographical knowledge went out the door with the "relevance" fad of the Sixties. <br><br>Kitten/Erika, oh, I 'm still not greatly into being anybody else's daddy! Still, an eccentric middle-aged friend can provide a good place for people to get together, too. ;-)<br><br>Roger, "donkey rider" ought to be a compliment, since managing a donkey takes a degree of knowledge and tact that most Americans will never have. <br><br>Glenn, certainly a lack of defeat is one of the worst problems we've got. Historically, those empires that had a long run of unbroken victories were most likely to pop like bubbles when defeat finally came. <br><br>Mark, fascinating. I'll have to reread that. <br><br>(dot), of course! It's characteristic of blind faith that failure just makes it stronger; I expect the loudest paeans to the invincibility of progress to come just before the last lights flicker out once and for all.<br><br><a href=#c2594926104425511865 title="comment permalink">6/28/15, 10:19 PM</a><br><br>

I think of the amount of work it takes to keep an online forum civil!<br><br>Jim, that's a useful metaphor, if nothing else. <br><br>J.D., thank you for the Hall reference -- I'll look into it -- and of course a Blue Oyster Cult reference is always welcome here. <br><br>Jean-Vivien, well, of course! I like your new acronym; if "wysiwyg" is pronounced "wizzy-wig," as I've usually heard it, would "wywiwywi" be pronounced "why-wee-why-wee"? <br><br>Ed-M, exactly -- of course ultimatums go back a long way; the question is when they became the only game in town, and I think you're quite right about the timing. <br><br>Ricardo, thanks for the report from sunny next-in-line-after-Greece! Your point about crisis is good, and needs to be integrated into the mix. <br><br>Varun, here again, the thing that strikes me as crucial is that the mechanistic philosophy of nature arrived <i>before</i> machines did. In 1650, when mechanical models of nature were all the rage, machines played a negligible role in human life, but they'd already come to dominate the imagination of a continent. It's reminiscent of the huge role that space travel played in the collective imagination of the US before we'd even put a human being in orbit. Hmm...<br><br>Chloe, well, barring some way to ask the opinion of Ardipithecus, I'm not going to speculate about the reason!

The accounts I've read about the Ultimatum Game always seem to miss the point that rejecting unfair divisions, though it may have immediately negative consequences in any specific case, leads to better outcomes overall by encouraging fairness. Once again, if you keep the whole system in mind -- as you did with your dog, and the thunder -- things make sense. <br><br>Heather, I'll certainly keep that in mind. <br><br>Carl, yes, that's about what I thought. Computers again...<br><br>Jo, here again, the idea of the universe as a machine became pervasive in Western society when machines played a negligible role in people's lives, and well before the industrial revolution. I don't buy technological determinism, because technologies don't just show up independently -- they are created and funded for reasons that include a hefty element of ideology. First we have a society obsessed by the image of the machine, and then -- because of that obsession -- it creates and funds machines. <br><br>Cherokee, why, yes, I seem to recall the same thing. Also some comments on the order of "what thou doest to the least of these, thou doest unto Me." I gather the people we're discussing never got around to reading that book. <br><br>Caryn, good. You're right about older technologies, btw: I recall a book from the 1920s that assumed that if you have a car, you need to be your own mechanic a lot of the time, and cars were designed with repair in mind. Now? Exactly the opposite. The question of why western European cultures piled into machines while other cultures avoided doing so is a complex question, and probably requires discussion, too. <br><br>Kutamun, okay, that gets you tonight's gold star. Thank you. <br><br>Aiastelamonides, bingo. To call biological evolution a learning process is of course to speak in metaphorical terms -- an evolving species or biosphere has no nervous system -- but it's a metaphor that points to important common ground. A species or a biosphere has evolved to generate novelty, so that when it encounters a challenge, it has a good chance of doing an end run around the challenge, in roughly the same way that a problem-solving human being generates novelty (in the form of new behaviors) and tests them against the problem until something works. <br><br>Caryn, different ages have different kinds of injustice. In late civilization, you get a lot of institutionalized injustice and vastly unfair class barriers, but a rule of law that can shield individuals from some kinds of abuses. In dark ages, the rule of law goes away, but so do the institutions, and social hierarchies become a lot flatter -- the gap in effective income and standards of living between an early medieval warlord and an early medieval peasant is much smaller than that between a modern American banker and a modern American shop clerk. So there's quite a bit of tradeoff. <br><br>Steve, I'd say rather that many technologies can be used as tools, or they can be used as prosthetics -- that is, as replacements for human functions, which require that people abandon some part of their own functionality in order to narrow their experience to fit the machine. <br><br>Christophe, excellent! Yes, Ockham and the Nominalists have been showing up on my radar screen quite a bit as I've been probing this.<br><br><a href=#c6037323281755994361 title="comment permalink">6/28/15, 11:16 PM</a><br><br>

Another way to say the same thing, if I'm understanding you correctly, is that human reasoning is very poor at dealing with complex systems, and can get boxed into a wholly fallacious view of things unless feedback loops act quickly enough to bring immediate disproof. <br><br>Unknown Deborah, good! That's a subset of "what you contemplate, you imitate" -- to resist something requires you to focus on it, and so to become like it. <br><br>Violet, the best answer I've been able to come up with to your final question is that you teach as many people as are willing to learn, and brace yourself for the impact when the rest slam face first into the brick wall of reality. If someone else has a better answer, I'm all ears. <br><br>Onething, it's always possible to find something to object to in any viewpoint other than one's own!<br><br>Sage, funny you mentioned that. I'll have a few things to say about that as we proceed...<br><br>Tom, Julian Jaynes made much the same claim several decades ago in <i>The Origins of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind</i>. I'm far from convinced that brain science supports the extreme end of the dual-brain theory, though. <br><br>Donalfagan, I'll have some fun with that claim this week. <br><br>Wizzard, fascinating. No, the accent and the profanity don't put me off -- I hear the local version any time I hang out with my brother Masons or my neighbors. <br><br>Eatopia, thanks for the link. <br><br>Compound F, of course consciousness is a fundamental property of the universe. The claim that it just pops up out of nowhere in a few lumps of meat called human brains, while being absent everywhere else, strikes me as the worst sort of anthropocentric superstition.<br><br><a href=#c2304558866797712929 title="comment permalink">6/28/15, 11:31 PM</a><br><br>

All I ask is that I'm identified as the author, and each post includes a link to my original. <br><br>Jean-Vivien, I was sorry to hear of the latest outrage -- France seems to be on the front lines of that particular mess.

To some extent what we've got is a set of machines -- literal as well as metaphorical -- that have outlived their creators but are still lurching ahead. How many people realize, for example, that the US suburbs were created for military reasons in the early stages of the Cold War, as a way to disperse population away from potential nuclear targets when those were still few and far between, and lost any reason to exist once missiles tipped with MIRVed H-boms replaced bombers hauling fission bombs as the likely instrument of Armageddon?<br><br><a href=#c1788919452187023893 title="comment permalink">6/28/15, 11:41 PM</a><br><br>

Actually what I was going for was the idea that because reasoning about complex systems is so hard, especially for highly interdependent ones that it can become necessary to abstract away large aspects of that system in order to be able to arrive at conclusions. This would be one of my hypothetical reasons for why humanity began to think of nature as merely a static thing back in the 17th century, the static nature abstraction was capable of making reasoning about the world more tractable and at least in the short run was capable of achieving good results, for this reason the abstraction became popular. I think another part is that after the death of God, reason became a substitute as a source of absolute authority. I.E. because my argument is well reasoned everyone should accept it. One of the reasons why modern people are not as willing to jettison old abstractions as they should be is that doing so would highlight some of the various subjective assumptions, and abstractions which most of the time are quite necessary in order to reason about anything. Every system has its down sides.<br><br>Also one minor quibble. I would not be certain that this is a problem with specifically "human reasoning". Even if the singularity were to occur this would likely still be a problem for the machine super intelligence, as it would almost certainly only be capable of computing those things computable by a "Turing Machine", and thus would not be able to solve first order logic problems in a guaranteed finite amount of time, and assuming NP not equal to P, even if it's a quantum computer solving propositional logic problem are still NP-complete and thus take worst case exponential time in the size of the input (so if the machine God is able to brute force a propositional logic problem with one million variables in a day in the worst case, then it would take the machine God one million days to brute force a logic problem with one million and twenty variables. Then after twenty doubling of the machine Gods computing power it would find that it took one million days to solve a one million and forty variable problem, and so on and so forth. Although this is likely a simplification of the problems such a being would face). That said I guess there could potentially exist Gods and or other being which possess the ability to solve all undecidable problems, and or who having access to infinite computing power, I personally doubt that.<br><br><a href=#c8346690308741565877 title="comment permalink">6/29/15, 4:58 AM</a><br><br>

(Exposure to too many other sites, especially the comments, can leave one despairing about those last.) In my imagination, this blog is a Master's level class, with both important topics and high expectations about how to think. I always learn as much about both from reading the comments (every one, almost every day) as from the "main text" itself, plus watching the conversation(s) evolve is fascinating in itself. I don't always have the background to comment on the main topic of the week's post, but I can feel my perspective broaden as I read others' questions, challenges, and reflections.

I would take it back even further - to the emergence of monothesism. You drain all the spirit out of the sacred groves and the coyotes and the herbs and locate it exclusively in One Big Daddy in the sky. Thereafter, pursuing spiritual meaning in your life is a matter of getting right somehow with that single god. An army of priests, rabbis, and imams are licensed by various kingdoms and nation-states to police the whole getting-right-with-god process. These religious authorities see all manifestations of nature-based spirituality as something to be snuffed out. And snuff them out they do. Nature is stilled, ceases to breathe, ceases to have purposes and meanings of its own that humans might feel obliged to respect or discern. The makers of the scientific revolution and of the philosophy that arose to rationalize it (Descartes the main culprit here) then have a free hand to treat all within their purview as one kind of mechanism or another. The idea that nature might be understood mathematically - as crazy a thought as has ever entered a thinking brain - takes hold in most centers of learning. To get an education is to be indoctrinated into this kind of soulless rationalism. Thereafter, anything that cannot be quantified falls beyond the scope of scientific inquiry; anything that will not succumb to deductive logic is banished from the realm of philosophical inquiry. Well before industrialization, everything is fully mechanized - the (natural) objects of inquiry and the brains doing the inquiring. Brains of this sort are eager and able to carry out the mechanization of the planet which accompanies the industrial revolution and totally unprepared for the blowback that ensues as nature - purposive, high-spirited, and powerful as ever - begins to exact revenge.<br><br>So, I agree with those who suggest that it is not machines per se - Robert Pirsig (Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance) gleans valuable insights from his engagement with the mechanical specifications and, that engagement notwithstanding, the ultimate whimsicality of his bike. He did not expect to “master” his machine but to learn from it how the two of them might get around together. Math, yes, but employed in pursuit of “quality” - the word he used for the object of a philosophy that was not divorced from nature and natural yearnings. By all means let us go after Descartes, but be prepared for Moses in the next circle after Descartes falls. <br><br>Brian Lloyd<br>occupythehearth@blogspot.com<br><br><a href=#c5171393998622432827 title="comment permalink">6/29/15, 11:54 AM</a><br><br>

This is NOT to say that people don’t need to learn basic facts, but it’s often observed that it’s difficult to teach large numbers of these types of facts (i.e. chief agricultural exports of MANY localities, along with their geographical features, leaders’ names, basic history, etc.) without resorting to isolated memorization. <br><br>Each state generally determines its own social studies (history, geography, government, civics, etc.) standards and chooses its own approved textbooks. In some cases the standards themselves are actually pretty sophisticated. For example, California’s Second Grade (seven and eight year olds) History/Social Science Standards do require students to draw from memory a basic map of North America with geographic features including the countries and their major rivers, mountain ranges, etc., with title, scale, date, legend, and directional indicators. That standard is one of thirteen CA History/Social Science standards for the second grade level. <br><br>(Just for kicks, I’ll quote in full the Economics portion-remember these kids are seven years from the womb:) <br>2.4 Students understand basic economic concepts and their individual roles in the economy and demonstrate basic economic reasoning skills.<br> 1. Describe food production and consumption long ago and today, including the roles of farmers, producers, distributors, weather, and land and water resources.<br> 2. Understand the role and interdependence of buyers (consumers) and sellers (producers) of goods and services.<br> 3. Understand how limits on resources affect production and consumption (what to produce and what to consume).<br><br>Wouldn’t it be terrific if most adults you knew, including policy makers, had a grasp of those concepts? JMG would have much less to discuss here each week, I think.<br> <br>Now imagine yourself in charge of selecting materials and tasks to help a group of twenty-four (or thirty or thirty-six, depending on the district) seven- and eight-year-olds to engage with these concepts in a meaningful way. Oh, while also teaching the other ten social science standards, along with math, science, reading, writing, literature, spelling, grammar, penmanship, physical education, music, art, (I think someone mentioned gardening this week too), nutrition, dental health (not kidding- as a fourth grade teacher I was expected to provide class time and instruction for brushing teeth), and on and on… <br> (cont.)<br><br><br><a href=#c2413695015010712246 title="comment permalink">6/29/15, 1:34 PM</a><br><br>

Textbooks are written by profit-driven companies, who aim at the broadest possible markets.

Unfortunately, in many districts the pressure to get standardized test scores up in math and reading (often the only subjects which get tested, and largely the only ones whose scores carry any weight), mean that those subjects absorb the vast quantity of class time, and other deeply important topics, including what the world is like and why it’s that way (addressed in part by meaningful study of geography), often get shoved out the door. <br><br>I disengaged from the system for these reasons, among others.

There was an group of young guys at UC Santa Cruz in the late 70’s who called themselves the “Dynamical Systems Collective.” They all had ideas about how Chaos Theory applied to real world events such as weather, dripping faucets, water flow, biology, and even human free will. <br>Classical Physics, as exemplified by Newton, was completely deterministic. Given the same initial conditions and the same laws of the behavior of matter, every repeat experiment would yield the same outcome. However, closer observation showed that in many cases this wasn’t true; that outcomes of repeated “identical” experiments actually diverged in time; there was a kind of disorder in order (randomness in pattern) and a kind of order in disorder (randomness in pattern). Chaos in this sense is somewhere between utter randomness and utter predictability.<br>The take away from this for me is that the kind of rigid deterministic machine behavior or machine-like thinking you are referring to in the post is a kind of abstraction/simplification of what is actually going on in the real world (what I call the Wet and Messy World). It seems to me that before the rise of deterministic Physics in the West, humans had an innate appreciation for the Chaos in the natural and human world; “shit happened” for no particular reason or because of the god’s whim, and people just had to live with it. The very idea of control in a chaotic world would have to be much more flexible and complex that it would be in a deterministic world. <br><br><br><a href=#c850587765505136011 title="comment permalink">6/29/15, 6:42 PM</a><br><br>

It's when urea, a chemical produced within human and animal bodies, was first synthesized from what chemists considered non-living materials. At the time (I think it was the 1800s, but I haven't fact-checked that; it's what I remember from history of science class 40 years ago), scientists still had the idea that there was something about living beings that made them fundamentally different from non-living things. Because of that, they thought, it would only be possible to make living beings, or their constituent parts, from other living beings. Urea is one of the chemicals produced by living beings (it's part of urine), so according to this idea, called vitalism, it wouldn't be possible to synthesize urea from, say, carbon dioxide and ammonia. Except then somebody, I don't remember who, did it. Now, chemists realized, it should be possible to build other chemicals made by bodies from materials considered to be non-living, and promptly did so. But what that did was remove a fundamental difference between living beings and non-living matter, one of the last if not the last fundamental difference that still remained in their eyes. It's not much of a step from there to thinking that living beings aren't all that different from complex machines - living bodies could potentially be produced from synthesizing all their body fluids, organs, tissues, bones, and so on from non-living materials in the same way that complex machines are made of simple machines hooked together in various ways. I don't think you could have thought of people as machines without this insight already being in place. (And if you think the idea of making living things from chemicals couldn't possibly be believed and acted on, you'd better check out what the synthetic biologists are doing these days. That's some majorly scary stuff.)<br><br><a href=#c6614355926757379044 title="comment permalink">6/29/15, 6:42 PM</a><br><br>

This possibility is seized upon by the capitalist mode of production and utilized to the fullest extent. What was mere technical possibility has become, since the Industrial Revolution, an inevitability that devastates with the force of a natural calamity, although there is nothing more ‘natural’ about it than any other form of the organization of labor. Before the human capacity to control machinery can be transformed into its opposite, a series of special condition must be met which have nothing to do with the physical character of the machine. The manner in which labor is deployed around the machine...must be dictated not by the human needs of the producers but by the special needs of those who own the machines and the labor power. Along with these special conditions, a social evolution must take place which parallels the physical evolution of machinery: a step by step creation of a “labor force” in place of self-directed human labor; that is to say, the creation of a working population conforming to the needs of this social organization of labor, in which knowledge of the machine becomes a specialized and segregated trait, while among the mass of the working population there grows only ignorance, incapacity, and thus a fitness for machine servatude.“<br><br><a href=#c2875931848702695714 title="comment permalink">6/29/15, 9:19 PM</a><br><br>

There is a surplus, but it is very small and for humans to extract more resources than that surplus from any given eco-system, they really have to draw down on the natural capital. Real wealth as you quite rightly discussed in your book, "The Wealth of Nature", is provided by the natural eco-system.<br><br>I'd have to suggest that somehow a meme has been inserted into our cultural identity that we are somehow separate and apart from nature. There is a great benefit to that meme because it allows humans to put their own needs and desires before that of the rest of the eco-system - even if those needs and desires are self defeating. It is sort of like the torturer who can reconcile themselves to their job by saying to themselves, "well those meat things are not humans so they don't count".<br><br>Further to that line of thinking the rise of the machine has such a grip on our culture because the tools enables our culture to satisfy our own needs and desires with less work, but it also has the self reinforcing narrative of displaying our specialness - you only need to hear someone who works with computers talking about how great they and we - by extension - are.<br><br>Dunno, I'm pondering this one as it's big.

The 1904 Haber–Bosch process produces ammonia from the nitrogen in the air using natural gas as the energy source. The basic process for synthetic urea, developed in 1922, is called the Bosch–Meiser urea process after its discoverers. Without these two processes producing the feedstock for the nitrogen component of artificial fertilizer, farming would have to rely on animal manure, and farming on the industrial scale would be impossible, as would the vast numbers of humans who rely on industrially grown crops. An interesting link between the view of world as machine and the predicament of human over-population? <br>Side note: prior to the discovery of synthetic ammonia and urea, Western hi-yield farming had been developed in the early 1800’s using guano (bird shit), an extremely concentrated source of nitrogen, from Pacific and Atlantic islands. By 1900, almost ALL the guano was harvested from those islands and the West faced a potential Malthusian crisis in agriculture. <br>Looks like the change from a “vital” world view to a mechanistic one was paralleled by a change from organic farming to synthetic chemical farming.<br><br><a href=#c1438246237874032264 title="comment permalink">6/30/15, 3:46 AM</a><br><br>

One that would follow orders and not think independently.<br><br>It makes me shudder to think of all the "issues" we are given to debate in the media.

They had to ensure that the goods they produced could be sold at a high enough price to pay for the equipment. There could be no competition, no other producers of goods. This started in medieval times didn't it? Peasants could only grind grain at the lord's mill - Water wheel powered mill.

A government can print money, but they also have to find suckers to exchange those IOU's for goods and services. The US is a massive importer of energy, raw materials and manufactured products and it relies on its creditors to accept the IOU's.<br><br>&gt; Such governments do not need to balance their budget, cut spending or even collect taxes, plus they will never run out of money because they create in the first place.<br><br>Of course they will never run out of money, because they can simply print more and I never suggested that they would. All economic bubbles end because sooner or later they run out of suckers willing to exchange the paper financial instruments for real world goods and service.<br><br>As to balancing the budget, it must be remembered that it is only possible to spend more than you earn when you can take from others. That is the whole point of the US military.<br><br>&gt; Japan, the poster child of money printing, just can’t seem to generate any kind of inflation<br><br>That all depends on your perspective and official inflation statistics to me smell like BS. I deal with AU to Yen trades and I'll tell you a little story. A Toyota Hilux vehicle which is the most used vehicle here in the mining industry will cost you about AU$40,000 on the road, but convert that AU$ amount to Yen and it becomes 3.76 million yen and you can tell me with a straight face that Japan doesn't suffer from inflation? The median house price here is ridiculously massive and everyone says that there is little to no inflation here - and they also have a straight face too - and yet I say to them that that is inflation (a consistently rising price).<br><br>&gt; Our children and grandchildren, along with institutions and pension funds, will happily hold government bonds, just as Grandma does, today<br><br>Government bonds are being devalued every single day through over use of the printing press. Have you ever wondered why official interest rates are so low? That is because the ability to service that increasing debt is maintained. If interest rates go up, then so too does the ability of your government to maintain the fiction that it can afford the debt. It is a form of accounting trickery.<br><br>&gt; such as increasing weaknesses<br><br>OK, I hear you. Of course, you are correct to doubt that because there is a meme in the US that none of your actions matter and I remarked to you before that that is only the case as long as you maintain your military primacy and can tell other countries to accept those IOUs. But there is also an underlying assumption in your response that other countries aren't aware of those weaknesses and that they won't take advantage of those weaknesses. Look at the effective US response to the artificial Chinese islands in the South China Sea - The US flew over a P-38 and I'll bet the Chinese were quaking in their boots as they continued building.

That sort of thing is driving up our property market and share market. It does not however produce productive capacity which would generate real economic growth, but merely increase wealth inequality as the rentier class seek investment returns. I've been thinking recently that the drive to push people’s income into the financial markets through means such as social security - which is non-negotiable - and away from the world of goods and services is an attempt to increase the price of financial assets and decrease the inflationary aspect of printing money policies.<br><br>&gt; During the 1970s the US experienced high inflation<br><br>I would have to agree with you in that this was due to the peaking of US oil production and the Oil price shocks set in play by the OPEC cartel. Oil is priced into everything.<br><br>&gt; large tax cuts and increased spending<br><br>Well, yeah. Such actions tend to increase the availability of income in the individual whom can then go out and buy goods and services. Low to middle income individuals tend to spend all that they earn that is why increasing wealth inequality tends to slow the economy and make things worse as the top end of town funnels that income into rent seeking assets.<br><br>As a general observation, I've noticed that some people in the US have a conversational habit whereby if they hear something that they don't like - which or may not be true - they tend to either ignore it, dismiss it, belittle it, or more often they tend to point at others as if the other party doesn't understand the simple ruse that has just taken place.<br><br>I mention this to you because I strongly suspect that you have an emotional and perhaps also financial investment in the system as it currently stands and I did mention to you that you are heavily involved in explaining the mechanics of the situation and tools and ignoring the bigger questions as to where will those mechanics and tools take you and it is to that issue that I am most concerned about.

I’ve set out to comment several times only to have various commenters here make the point I had in mind before I could. That is one of the failings people encounter in dealing with complex systems; it is economical to reduce variables to one dependent one. Dietrich Dorner explains it well in The Logic of Failure, a book which is not readily amenable to paraphrase, but which I’ll instead quote at some length:<br><br>“The slowness of our thinking and the small amount of information we can process at any one time, our tendency to protect our sense of our competence, the limited inflow capacity of our memory, and our tendency to focus only on immediately pressing problems- these are the simple causes of the mistakes we make in dealing with complex systems.”<br><br>“If, instead of clarifying the complex interrelationships among variables in a system, we select one variable as central, we are economizing in two respects: first, we dispense with a great deal of additional analytical work; second, we save time later in gathering information and in planning, for if one variable is central to the entire problem at hand, we need information only about that variable. If everything else depends on it anyway, we don’t have to worry about the status of other variables. We can also focus our planning on the one core variable. Reductions of this type are hard to beat. They allow us to make the most economical use of that precious resource we call “thought.”<br><br>It would seem that this is essentially a biological limit (or a combination of several), analogous to the way people tend to run out of stored carbohydrates somewhere past mile 17 of a marathon. I like this analogy because it's another biological limitation people love to misconstrue as some kind of moral failing which one ought to overcome with grit, or pluck, or what have you.<br><br><a href=#c5240434259249831997 title="comment permalink">6/30/15, 8:15 AM</a><br><br>

Then the "consumption/materialism" mindset, thoroughly prepared by years of TV and other propaganda, simply kicks into gear. Exceptions exist, certainly, but on the whole this appears, to me, to be mostly true.<br><br>Unless one is exposed to nature, the land, other people in various cultures and economic circumstances - then there is no thought given as to what they should do with their largesse. We are taught to consume, and to desire to live beyond our means, if we simply watch TV. The path of least resistance and maximum 'toys' is very consciously laid out in TV-Land. And the first purchased appliance most young people buy is a smartphone, then a TV...<br><br>The number of American people that have never spent a night or two outside under the night sky is staggering. Even fewer have spent a week... When a culture such as ours is disconnected from the planet that birthed us, and has little cognizance of our place in the universe, SOMETHING must assume the place of that soothing knowledge.<br><br>That is why I posted the video link in a comment above - to let people know that there are many more aware, responsible and traditional people out in the world - but in my experience these people have a close relationship with their world and/or have experienced hardships. It takes a very resolute demeanor to "collapse early and beat the rush", but so many are already there and aware.<br><br>Many of those writing 'doom porn' and other drivel on the internet have yet to experience true hardship - many have led massively charmed lives - and it is that group who will bear watching during the descent. And according to Ugo Bardi's 'Limits to Growth' revision, we are on the descent curve already - it fits well with what we are seeing economically and in terms of resources. <br><br>In the woods and rural areas, the collapse of the financial sector and even governments is muted - because there is less of both in rural America.

See, according to our glitterati, this was a fool's errand and we weren't getting into any Coalition of Idiots. <br><br>So we did our superiority dance, we exulted in our enlightenment and gloried in our wonderfulness. <br><br>No, our Prime Minister of the time, a Liberal (and that automatically puts him onto a higher moral and intellectual plane), sent Canadian troops to Afghanistan. See, we were joining the Coalition of Geniuses. <br><br>Our toweringly brilliant progressive governing elite of the time judiciously looked at Afghanistan, somehow saw Vancouver Island, and somehow mistook Afghan tribesmen as sandal wearing, socially aware environmentalists, all of them eager to learn modern customs and eager to embrace our feminist-friendly ways. Don't laugh. <br><br>How smart are we? During the stay in Afghanistan we expended 158 dead and close to 1,900 injured and wounded. Accounting for the 10X disparity in population between the US and Canada, these would be equivalent to 1,580 US dead and 19,000 injured and wounded. <br><br>And how many billions of dollars you ask? Don't ask. There's no power on earth that could extract a number from the shambles we call public accounts. <br><br>We did it, you see, because we're SO smart. <br><br>Then we ask our de-limbed veterans, who left arms and legs in Afghanistan, to verify on a yearly basis that the missing limb is still missing so as to qualify for certain benefits. Can never be too careful. Tell me JMG, has anyone ever re-grown a leg lost in combat? <br><br>Absurdly, elected politicians (many of them Liberal) advocated investigating and possibly prosecuting Canadian soldiers for following directives as given by the previous Liberal government. That is, the same government that these Liberal politicians were members of. Incredible you say? No JMG, not incredible, we scale Everests of Idiocy in this place. <br><br>So you say that managing a donkey requires knowledge and tact? None of that here. <br><br>I'll give some credit and that's for the most breath-taking cynicism. There's a dirty little secret here. Do you think we sent Canadian jets to bomb ISIS or kept our troops in Afghanistan because anyone thought there was a snowball's chance of success? No, we did it because we want American officialdom to think we're a faithful ally against terrorists. <br><br>What the hell for you ask? To keep the border open to the many billions of dollars in Canadian products that travel down to the US. There's a huge number of mortgage and car payments in this place that depend it. Yep, Tough on Terror we are by golly. More to the point, money is money and soldiers lives are expendable. <br><br>OK, as late as 2009 even John McCain thought that the 9/11 hijackers came down from Canada.

How do you do this as the social order as we know it is unraveling?" <br><br>I would say, as always, you teach between the gathering firewood, making food and all the other tasks that make up life. An unraveling order may make some of these tasks harder (or easier), but regardless of the times you are in, life goes on.<br><br>Don't give up on teaching. Your link to the DB you put together was great.<br><br><br><br>@Vincent<br><br>I take some exception to your comment to Cherokee. You said:<br><br>"The procedure is straight forward, although I simplify for clarity. An investor purchases a Treasury Security. The money used to purchase this security already exists. In exchange for his money, the investor now owns an interest bearing asset as opposed to his non-interest bearing asset (cash).<br><br>During QE this process was simply reversed. The investor traded his interest bearing asset back into cash. What you have is asset exchanging. There is NO money printing. Think of it as transferring money from your checking account to a savings account, and then back into your checking account. This is why there wasn’t any inflation, as so many direly predicted."<br><br>I think you are confusing an individual investor and the FED in regards to how it effects the money supply. It is true that when an investor buys a bond they trade their existing cash for in essence an IOU. No net change in currency (unless they bought it from the FED in which case money supply is reduced). However when the FED buys bonds, MBS or whatever as they did in QE, they are creating new currency for that purchase. The collateral they buy is the backing for that new currency. This is the major difference between the FED which can create money (federal reserve notes) and an individual who cannot. The FED's balance sheet has grown by several times during QE. Certainly the FED did not have (nor did anyone else have) that much cash just lying around looking to do something. That QE money was created to buy the "worthless" assets of banks and other institutions in an attempt to make their balance sheets look solvent.<br><br>So QE was a major money creating experience. The reason we have not seen that additional money producing inflation (IMO of course) is that it was handed primarily to large banks and financial institutions who by and large did not circulate that money to the population as a whole (also the reason it failed to produce much of an economic boost). Recall all the clamor a few years back about how the banks were being given all this money but loans were hard for most people to get?<br><br>Another explanation for the lack of inflation is that the money created went to offset the bad loans which existed. With the Fed now holding those loans/paper they have blocked their deflationary effect by injecting new money into the system to replace that lost by the bad paper. Both explanations can co-exist. I'll leave it for economists to argue as to which, if either it was.<br><br><a href=#c8533656603976975419 title="comment permalink">6/30/15, 5:41 PM</a><br><br>

A neighbor loaned me their green wizardry book a while back, and beyond reference books for animals we keep and plants we medal with, it's one of the only books I've read cover to cover since entering adulthood haha. A certain part of my brain has rarely been so exercised as when I initially learned HOW to, and now continue to, read your work. My biggest takeaway, beyond historical and or logical confirmation that my less historically informed and more intuitive sentiments are not particularly crazy, might just be the relatively straight forward "heads up" you offer with respect to various aspects of the state of my generation and global context. You've helped me maybe more than anyone to maintain a balanced and pragmatic perspective with regard to both physical and social trends and patterns of the world I'm living in, and that's been so valuable for me. It's easy to get all excited about some flashy notion of how things work, and you're perspective has been an aid to my temperance. In any event, I took my wife on a date last night to see Jurassic World, you know, since she has had Jurassic Park nightmares on occasion since she was a kid. Have you seen it by chance? Sorry if this has already been asked, haven't read all the comments. Themes of this blog post and that film seem almost too similar to be coincidence! Hero figure even uttered that he "prefers to think of it (Jurassic World) as a living system"! And my wife began counting how many times they mentioned the word "control", referring to the lack of it. In either case, giving some credit where it is due, even to popular media, I would have to say the writers of this film aren't likely too lost on topics you've covered in this post. Here's to hoping some of the viewers can make the connection, and apply the sentiments of "the delusion of control" to more than just raptor/t-rex hybrids with lots of sharp teeth.<br><br><a href=#c7737900771596603558 title="comment permalink">7/1/15, 2:16 PM</a><br><br>
