<div class=MsoNormal>
Maybe it’s just the psychology of selective attention, but tolerably often when I want to go into more detail about a point made in a previous essay here, stories relevant to that point in one way or another start popping up on the news. That’s been true even during this blog’s forays into narrative fiction, so it should be no surprise that it’s happened again—even though, in this case, the point in question may not be obvious to most readers yet. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of the core themes of the Retrotopia narrative I’ve been developing here over the last month or so is the yawning gap between the abstract notion of progress that we all have in our heads and the rather less pleasant realities to which this notion has been assigned. The imaginary Atlantic Republic, the home of the narrative’s viewpoint character, is a place where progress as we know it has continued in exactly the same direction it’s been going for the last half century or so. That’s why it’s a place where income is concentrated in ever fewer hands, leaving most of the population to struggle for survival via poorly paid part-time jobs or no jobs at all; a place where infrastructure has been allowed to fall into ruin, while investment gets focused instead on a handful of high-tech services such as the metanet (my hypothetical 2065 “improvement” of today’s internet); a place where people make do with shoddy, wretchedly unpleasant consumer goods because that’s what a handful of big corporations want to sell them and there are no other alternatives, and so on. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course the immediate response of many people to this characterization can be summed up neatly as “but that’s not progress!” Au contraire, the changes just noted, unwelcome as they are, are the necessary and inevitable consequences of exactly those technological transformations that have been lauded to the skies in recent years as evidence of just how much we’ve progressed. In the same way, my imaginary Lakeland Republic, with its prosperous working classes, its thriving urban centers, its comfortable clothing, and the like, has those things because it made certain collective choices that fly in the face of everything that most people these days understand as progress. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For instance, to cite a detail that sparked discussion on the comments page last week, the Lakeland Republic has abandoned computer technology—or more precisely, after the Second Civil War and the crises that followed, it rebuilt its infrastructure and economy without making computer technology part of the mix. There were a variety of reasons for that choice, but one was an issue I’ve raised in these essays several times already: when you have an abundance of people who want steady employment and a growing shortage of the energy and other resources needed to build and operate machines, replacing employees with machines is not necessarily a smart idea, while replacing machines with employees may just be the key to renewed prosperity and stability. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s an issue in the story, and also in our lives today, because computers have eliminated vastly more jobs than they’ve created. Before computers came in, tens of millions of Americans supported themselves with steady jobs as typists, file clerks, stenographers, and so on through an entire galaxy of jobs that no longer exist due to computer technology. The jobs that have been created by computer technology, on<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>the other side of the balance, employ far fewer people, leaving the vast remainder to compete for the remaining bottom-level jobs, and this has driven down wages and widened the gap between the well-to-do and everyone else. That’s not what progress is supposed to do, according to the conventional wisdom, but that’s what it has done—and not just in this one case. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Since 1970, in point of fact, the standard of living for everyone in America outside of the wealthiest 20% or so has skidded unsteadily downward. The nation’s infrastructure has been abandoned to malign neglect, and a great many amenities that used to be taken for granted either cost vastly more than they once did, even corrected for inflation, or can’t be had for any price. We pretend, or at least the vast majority of us do, that these things either haven’t happened or don’t matter, and certainly nobody’s willing to address the possibility that these things and other equally unwelcome changes have been the result of what we like to call progress—even when that’s fairly obviously the case. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What’s going on here, in other words, is the emergence of a widening chasm between the abstraction “progress” and the things that progress is supposed to represent, such as improved living conditions, a broader range of choices available to people, and so on. The sort of progress we’ve experienced over the last half century or so hasn’t given us these things; quite the contrary; it’s yielded degraded living conditions, a narrower range of choices, and the like. Point this out to people in so many words and the resulting cognitive dissonance tends to get some truly quirky responses; put it in the form of a narrative and—at least this is my hope—a larger fraction of readers will be able to recognize the tangled thinking at the heart of the paradox, and recognize a dysfunctional abstraction for what it is. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Dysfunctional abstractions, though, are all the rage these days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A glance through the news offers a bumper crop of examples. One that comes forcefully to mind, just at the moment, is the ongoing attempts on the part of US political and military spokescritters to find some way to talk about the US airstrike on a hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan, without actually mentioning that the US carried out an airstrike on a hospital and killed twenty-two civilians, including three children. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It really has been a remarkable spectacle, and connoisseurs of weasel-worded evasions have had a feast spread out before them. Early on, the media in the US and its allies was full of reports that the hospital had been hit by an airstrike that somehow didn’t get around to mentioning whose aircraft was involved. Then there were stalwart claims that it hadn’t yet been confirmed that a US aircraft carried out the strike. Once that evasion passed its pull date—the Taliban, after all, doesn’t have an air force, and the public relations flacks at the Pentagon apparently decided that it just wasn’t going to work to insist that they’d somehow come up with one just for the sake of this one airstrike—the excuses began flying fast and thick. The fact that the four officially promulgated excuses I’ve seen so far all contradict one another doesn’t exactly make any of them seem particularly convincing. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What the excuses and evasions demonstrate, rather, is that the US military and government are treating what happened entirely as a matter of abstractions, rather than dealing with the harsh but inescapable reality of twenty-two smoldering corpses in a burnt-out hospital. To the media flacks at the Pentagon, evidently, this is all merely a public relations problem, and the only response to it they can think of involves finding some set of excuses, euphemisms, and evasions that will allow them to efface the distinction between a public relations problem and a war crime. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course it’s not as though this sort of atrocity is unusual for the US at this point on the sorry downslope of its history. The only thing that makes the bombing of the Kunduz hospital at all unusual is that a significant fraction of the targets weren’t locals—they were physicians and hospital staff from the international charity M<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">é</span>decins sans Fronti<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>è</span>res, who can’t be ignored quite so easily. For well over a decade now, the US government has been vaporizing assorted groups of people all over the Middle East via drone strikes, and according to everybody but the paid flacks of the US government, a very large fraction of the people blown to bits in these attacks have been civilians. Here again, Washington DC treats this as a public relations problem, and simply denies that anything of the sort has happened. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The difficulty with this strategy, though, is that sooner or later you run up against an opponent that isn’t stuck on the level of abstractions, isn’t greatly interested in public relations, and intends to do you real, rather than abstract, harm. To some extent that’s what has sown the whirlwind that the US and its allies are now reaping in the Middle East. In many of the tribal cultures of the Middle East, vengeance against the killers of one’s family members is an imperative duty, and it doesn’t matter how airily the flacks in Washington DC dismiss the possibility that the latest drone strike annihilated a Yemeni wedding party, or what have you. The relatives of the dead know better, and the young men among them are going to do something about it, whether that involves hiking to Afghanistan or, say, joining the current mass migration into Europe, lying low for a while, and then looking for suitable targets. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The same difficulty has shifted into overdrive over the last few weeks, though, with Russia’s entry into the Syrian civil war. Russia’s current leaders are realists, which is to say, they assign abstractions the limited importance they deserve. The Russian presence in Syria, accordingly, isn’t a mere gesture, it’s the efficient deployment of an expeditionary force that’s clearly intended to wage war, and is in the early stages of turning that intention into hard reality. In an impressively short time, the Russians have built, staffed, and stocked a forward air base at Latakia, and begun systematic air strikes against rebel positions; work has gotten under way on two other bases; weapons and munitions are flooding into Syria to rearm the beleaguered Syrian army; the first detachments of Revolutionary Guard soldiers from Russia’s ally Iran have arrived.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Russian Spetsnaz (special forces) and airborne units are en route to Syrian soil, where they and the Iranians will doubtless have something to do besides soak up rays on Latakia’s once-famous Mediterranean beaches. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meanwhile Russia’s Black Sea fleet, led by its flagship, the guided missile cruiser <i>Moskva</i>, has positioned itself off the Syrian coast. That in itself tells an important story. The <i>Moskva</i> carries long range antiship missiles and an S-300 antiaircraft system; there are reports that another S-300 system has been set up on land, and Russian electronic warfare equipment has also been reported at Latakia. Neither the Islamic State militia nor any of the other rebel forces arrayed against the Syrian government have a navy, an air force, or electronics sufficiently complex to require jamming in the event of hostilities. The only nation involved in the Syrian civil war that has all these things is the United States. Clearly, then, Russia is aware of the possibility that the US may launch an air or naval assault on the Russian expeditionary force, and has the weaponry on hand to respond in kind. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Last night, working on this post, I wrote: “The Russian airstrikes so far have concentrated on rebel forces around the edges of the territory the Syrian government still holds, with some longer-range strikes further back to take out command centers, munitions dumps, and the like. The placement of the strikes says to me that the next moves, probably within weeks, will be against the rebel enclave north of Homs and the insurgent forces in Idlib province. I expect ground assaults backed up by artillery, helicopter gunships, and close-in air support—vastly more firepower, in other words, that any side in the Syrian civil war has had at its disposal so far.” This morning’s news confirmed that guess, and added in another factor: Russian cruise missiles launched from the Caspian Sea fleet, most of a thousand miles from Syria. Once Idlib and the rest of western Syria is secured, I expect the Russians and their allies to march on Raqqa, the Islamic State’s notional capital—and I don’t expect them to waste any more time in doing so than they’ve wasted so far. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All this poses an immense embarrassment to the United States and its allies, which have loudly and repeatedly proclaimed the Islamic State the worst threat to world peace since the end of the Third Reich but somehow, despite a seemingly overwhelming preponderance of military force, haven’t been able to do much of anything about it. Though it’s hard to say for sure, given the fog of conflicting propaganda, it certainly looks as though the Russians have done considerably more damage to the Islamic State in a week than the US and its allies have accomplished in thirteen months of bombing. If that’s the case, some extremely awkward questions are going to be asked. Is the US military so badly led, so heavily burdened with overpriced weapons systems that don’t happen to work, or both, that it’s lost the ability to inflict serious harm on an opponent? Or—let’s murmur this one quietly—does the United States have some reason not to want to inflict serious harm on the Islamic State? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I suspect, though, that what’s actually behind the disparity is something far simpler, if no less damaging to the prestige of the United States. I commented in an earlier post here that the US has been waging its inept campaign against Islamic State as though it’s a video game—hey, we killed a commander, isn’t that worth an extra 500 points? Look at that from a different perspective and it becomes another example of the total disconnection of abstraction from reality. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The abstraction here is “fighting Islamic State.” You’ll notice that it’s not “defeating Islamic State”—in the realm of dysfunctional abstractions, such differences mean a great deal. Obama has decided that under his leadership, the US is going to fight Islamic State, and that’s what the Pentagon is doing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At intervals, accordingly, planes go flying over various portions of Syria and Iraq to make desultory bombing runs on places where some intelligence analyst in suburban Virginia thinks an Islamic State target might have been located at some point in the last month or so. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s “fighting Islamic State.” Nobody can point a finger at Obama and say that he’s not fighting Islamic State, since the Air Force is still obligingly making those bombing runs. It doesn’t matter that none of this has done anything to slow down the expansion of the Islamic State militia, or to stop its appalling human rights violations; that’s in the grubby realm of realities, into which fastidious minds in Washington DC are unwilling to stoop.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Another abstraction that’s getting a lot of use in the current situation is “moderate Syrian rebels.” In the realm of realities, of course, those don’t exist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Pentagon’s repeated attempts to find or manufacture some, to satisfy Obama’s insistence that a supply of them ought to be forthcoming, have yielded one embarrassing failure after another.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is for quite a simple reason, all things considered: the word “moderate” in this context means, in effect, “willing to put the interests of the US and its European allies ahead of their country and their faith.” (When American politicians use the word “moderate” about people in other countries, that’s inevitably what they mean.) Nonetheless, since the abstraction is so useful, the politicians and the Pentagon keep on waving it around. You have to read carefully to find out that some groups being labeled as potential moderates, such as the al-Nusra Front, are affiliated with al-Qaeda—you know, the outfit that the Global War On Terror was supposed to fight. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Such things should probably come as no surprise during the presidency of a man who got into office via a campaign that was never anything more than a blur of feel-good abstractions: “Hope,” “Change,” “Yes We Can,” and the like.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Barack Obama will go down in history as one of the United States’ least competent presidents precisely because everything he’s done has been so utterly fixated on the realm of abstractions. The wretchedly misnamed “Affordable Care Act” aka Obamacare is a fine example. Its enactment has made health care more expensive and less available for most Americans; it took what was already the worst health care system in the industrial world, and accomplished the not inconsiderable feat of making it even worse. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To Obama and his dwindling crowdlet of supporters, though, that doesn’t matter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What matters is that the resulting mess corresponds, to them, to the abstraction “national health care system.” He promised a national health care system, we have a national health care system—and of course it’s not exactly irrelevant that the privileged few who still praise that system are by and large those whose wealth shields them from having to cope with its disastrous failings. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s only fair to note that, deeply immersed in the realm of dysfunctional abstractions as Obama is, he’s got plenty of company there, and it’s not limited to the faux-liberal constituencies that put him into his current address. Listen to the verbiage spewing out of the overcrowded Republican clown car and you’ll get to witness any number of vague abstractions floating past, serenely disconnected from the awkward realm of facts. For that matter, take in the outpourings of the establishment’s pet radicals—I’m thinking just now of Naomi Klein’s embarrassingly slipshod and superficial book
<i>This Changes Everything</i>, but there are plenty of other examples—and you’ll find no shortage of equally detached abstractions drifting by in the breeze, distracting attention from the increasingly dismal landscape of fact down there on the ground. </div>
<br>
What troubles me most about all this is what it says about the potential for really serious disruptions here in the US in the near future. I’m sure my readers can think of other regimes that reached the stage where moving imaginary armies across a landscape of dreams took precedence over grappling with awkward facts, and once that happened, none of those regimes were long for this world. The current US political system is so deeply entrenched in its own fantasies that a complete breakdown of that system, and its replacement by something entirely different—not necessarily better, mind you, but different—is a possibility that has to be kept in mind even in the near term. </div>

They will make a desolation, and call it peace. Over the long run, I'm not sure this will prove a tenable strategy. The Chechen war is not really over in any meaningful sense of the word. The cost to the Russian state and Russian people was very, very high, and I doubt it put an end to Islamist extremism nor Chechen nationalism.<br>3 - All that said, I listened to an amusing story on NPR this afternoon, in which the commentator was interviewing some talking head about how absurd it was that Russian was acting unilaterally and against the wishes of the US and the West! Why couldn't the commentator understand that that was unacceptable? And so on... While I disagreed with some of the talking head's specific points, the overall gist that not only does Putin NOT care what the West thinks, and is under no obligation to play by Western rules after two decades of getting kicked around by the West seemed spot on to me a very germane to this post.<br><br><a href=#c1638254164290166298 title="comment permalink">10/7/15, 5:52 PM</a><br><br>

As to "selective memory" - well, I prefer an in-your-face synchronicity, one that only a heightened perception can conjure up, and one that validates, in effect, your take on the subject. Not sure if that would stand up in a court of law, but its what I think anyway. <br><br>Re Obama's incompetency - I'm inclined to agree with the conservative view that O's flailing is pretty well calculated on his part. Given his background and sympathies, he really does want to cut the USA down to what he sees as acceptable size. I imagine that it's not so much that O is by himself bringing about the decline of the USA and western civ - you know, as if the election of a contemporary conservative president would do all that much to arrest the decline - but that leaders like Obama just appear in times of decline. <br><br><br><a href=#c3708708434026790480 title="comment permalink">10/7/15, 6:10 PM</a><br><br>

People overseas might even order tools made by hand from craftsmen based in the USA through mail order. But that would overlap your Retrotopia, except I wish the harshest thing that continent will have to face should only be a couple of years with the most insignificant government in the world... Being insignificant might even help the leaders of the USA to do their job competently.

If the anti-Syrian-government forces, such as they are, should overthrow the Syrian Government, it's a toss-up between (a) warlord-i-stan (b) caliphate, or (c) a military dictator brutal enough to defeat IS, i.e., another one just like Assad. <br><br>Lastly, in my opinion, if Russia really tried to conquer all of what used to be Syria, I don't think they'd fare any better than the US would.

The quality of life hasn't improved and it has declined. The local municipal council where I live, recently got rid of almost all of the kiddie wading pools; or in some instances made them into automated splash parks because they can't afford them anymore. When I was a kid in the 70's, I'd spend almost everyday at the wading pool with my friends during the summer. This also allowed the teenage lifeguard to have a decent and respectable summer job. Is it progress, they can't afford to give a teenager a summer job, and the kids are treated to the banal push of a button (accompanied by their helicopter parent) splash park instead?<br><br>Recently I've noticed a few profound and worrisome changes. Everyone I know, at work, family, ect, has gone mad crazy with trying to win the lottery. As if the trillion to one chance of winning the 50 million dollar prize is an obtainable result. If they took the money they are spending on gambling and shared it among themselves instead, in an alternating pool system, they'd be better off with lesser amounts. This massive shift to compulsive gambling suggests to me that awkward reality is no longer fitting the social narrative, and that people are getting desperate.<br><br>Recently, on a routine visit to my family doctor, my quiet and mild mannered family physician told me that all of the doctors have had to install panic buttons in their offices, because people are screaming and yelling at them during visits, especially in instances where they refuse to prescribe narcotics. That's an unsettling circumstance. New signs posted everywhere in the clinic, that abusive behavior is not tolerated. It's as if respectful public decency has somehow suddenly vanished? Also a sign of increasing desperation.<br><br>This matched only with the deafening silence and lack of public outcry at the recent events in Syria. You'd think that people don't care that WWIII has recently become more probable? Daily stories about potential US and Russian pilots being on a trigger edge of starting dogfights in the air above Syria has me worried. Yet people at work are worried and fully engaged about ongoing hockey player contract negotiations. I find myself stunned at the disconnect!?<br><br><br><br><a href=#c9005000335014748849 title="comment permalink">10/7/15, 6:34 PM</a><br><br>

Now, don't get me wrong, I like -and share- Kunstler's attitude of righteous indignation toward the folly of our leaders, most of the time, if not always where he takes things.<br><br>But I think you might be missing, or leaving out, some important aspects of our ongoing failures in the Middle East, which seem to me to be at least as damning as what you've outlined. I doubt that people as smart as Obama and our military leaders totally miss how ineffective our tactics have been thus far. Actually, I think you've overstated their ineffectiveness, but that's beside the point, so I won't argue it. They certainly haven't met their stated goals.<br><br>But I think our failures are less about a inability to understand the situation, and more the result of just playing a very poor game of chess. I had to look up Latakia to find it is the major port of Syria. Think about that for a moment: the Russians are ensconced in one of the presumably more secure parts of the subject nation, with "boots on the ground" and more importantly, eyes in the field. They have the cooperation and intelligence resources of the host nation, and allies in the region willing to put more troops on the ground, and the ability to coordinate with reliable Iranian and Syrian forces. We have none of that, having done a masterful job of alienating everyone in the region, with the possible exception of the Kurds.<br><br>The result: we have a very limited ability to locate targets, and then just the blunt instrument of air strikes as a weapon. We are living with the consequences of decades of terrible choices, and have more or less lost the ability to project force in that part of the world.<br><br>Obviously, I'm not totally disagreeing with you, mainly a different emphasis. I'll grant that you seem to have some good information sources, which I hope you can share with us.

After a few months of operation, something went wrong with the labor-saving hardware, and what is displayed is a nonsensical group of letters and other symbols. That's been going on for weeks, and has not been fixed.<br><br>Second anecdote, also somewhat related to last weeks installment about Mr. Carr's clothing. Cold weather is setting in here in Vermont, close to freezing at night. I've had a hard time in recent years finding tall slippers to keep my (large male) feet and ankles warm in the winter, indoors, with the thermostat set not too high. The local stores mostly carry nonsensical offerings such as slippers that only cover the toes. Mail-order often brings in made-in-China slippers that are flimsy and 2 sizes smaller than claimed. So today I stopped by a sizable department store that belongs to a national chain. This store, in the few times I've ventured in there, seems to have more salescritters than shoppers, even in December. I couldn't find such (only a few in the women's department), so asked a salescritter. He said it is too early in the season, they'll come in in a month or two. I said "but it's going to freeze soon". Says he: "oh no, it's still 3 months before freezing weather." - Does he live inside the store? Commute by heated limousine from Atlanta?

Thursday can never come around soon enough around here. Your writings on 'progress' made me remember the use of the term 'crapification of things' used over at the Naked capitalism website and there is an article there at http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2014/02/james-surowiecki-promotes-myth-consumer-empowerment-face-crappification-almost-everything.html which talks about the things you talk about regarding our dystopia. The comments are worth reading too and you can see we are all of us already living in the Atlantic Republic no matter where you live.<br><br> Talking about abstract ideas of progress taking over from reality-based assessments, there is a perfect illustration of this in operation at http://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/the-pentagons-concurrency-myth-is-now-available-in-supe-1689810660 and is very much worth reading all the way through. The F-35 fighter is notorious for being in production before design and testing were even completed and it was the idea of concurrency that was responsible for that - putting into something production while it is still in testing as the design process would be so great that testing would only be a formality. Guess how that worked out, go on, guess.<br><br> It now appears that the same abstract idea is being used in America's supercarrier construction so that the US Navy may end up with supercarriers that cannot even launch and retrieve aircraft reliably in port much less on the high seas during hi tempo operations. I remember reading your novel "Twilight's Last Gleaming" when it came out in installments back in 2012 and this makes the military defeats in your novel far more believable now.<br><br> Meanwhile the Russians are having a field day listening to American shrill comments on their operations in Syria. On their English version news &amp; blog sites, there is a theory that the West was about to impose a no-fly zone in Syria to destroy the Syrian military and let the 'moderate' al-qaeda headchoppers win, hence the Russian military imposing their own no-fly zone. They point out, for example, failings that the West has made such as how ISIS took Palmyra but to do so they had to travel along a 150 kilometer road through a desert with no cover and somehow the Americans missed it? Really? Who is playing who over there?<br><br><a href=#c7463185937421411946 title="comment permalink">10/7/15, 7:09 PM</a><br><br>

I've been in the position of having to hire those people, I know what they're demanding and getting paid. I have this mental image of them as hungry monsters - just like the banks - as they eat all before them without considering where tomorrow’s meal will come from. And to be sure, those computer geeks can demand those salaries, because they're putting people out of work. Economists have a delightful abstraction called: Labour productivity, and they're always banging on about it. But that little abstraction only counts people that are actively employed and sort of forgets about all of the unemployed (or the under employed because they're cheaper). It is shameful.<br><br>As a method of healing a very damaged workforce team years ago, I took a much lower salary than my predecessor, used the cost savings to more fairly equalise the pays in the team, immediately walked a troublemaker within hours of taking control and thus the majority of the healing was complete. From the outset I said to that team: What went on in the past was not on, and I will show you the way forward. When I eventually left employment there after about two years, some of the staff cried, I mean there were tears - it was really very sweet. The only person in the team that used to constantly whine about their pay was the computer geek and it used to really annoy because he wanted more money than I was on - with 1/10th of the responsibilities.<br><br>Oh, am I'm ranting? It does sound like it.<br><br>I hadn't heard about the hospital airstrike but it doesn't surprise me as no one wins hearts and minds with airstrikes on civilian targets out of the blue. If I was a warlord in that conflict, the response I would have to that situation would be the sort that you are referring to: a slow, quiet and effective burn - it is not as if it is hard to figure that one out.<br><br>I have been watching the involvement of the Russians and they've certainly decided that it is time to get serious and support the Syrians - Blind Freddy could see that.<br><br>No disrespect to the men and women on the ground in our armed forces as I reckon they're doing it tough, but the leadership of those forces must be senile, because how could a conflict become so protracted over such a wide sphere that it has gone on for more than the time that it took to complete World War I and II combined? Why isn't anyone asking the hard question, what are we trying to achieve there and why are we paying for that? It just makes no sense at all and what is worse is that the decision makers appear to be expanding the number of conflicts we are all involved in (please Sir, more!). A divided military cannot fight on so many fronts - sooner or later there will be a defeat, it is only common sense.

It is an enjoyable read and some good photos. The farm has just been through an historically record breaking heat wave for this early in the year and the plants are growing strongly. There are some great photos which show the comparison in plant growth over just a few days. Plus, please spare a thought for us down here as there is a large and very out of control bush fire now burning over on the other side of the mountain range in the elevated plains (a map of the fire affected areas is at the bottom of the blog).

This is likely to be dangerous if the US and Russia get into an actual war.

There's this idea that we can do anything we set our mind to, and that we are the arbiters of all morality and standards on the planet.<br><br>One thing I notice is that a certain friend of mine is very much cheering at reduced infant mortality, raised education levels and similar metrics in the developing world. Increased poverty, infrastructure decay and the like gets dismissed on the grounds that all this is due to increased inequality, which could easily be fixed had we the will. Explaining that increased inequality and clueless elites is often found in declining civilizations doesn't seem to make any impact. It's like poverty here doesn't count somehow. <br><br>I think I'm going to have to avoid the subject of civilization decline with her. The discussion got a bit heated when I mentioned the possibility of large-scale migration over many decades from MENA to Europe as a possible contributing factor among many others. It's just frustrating; we used to think so alike on world issues and now on some subjects it's become very difficult to communicate.

It seems insane to provoke the Bear, until you remember that may be the only enemy our military is geared to defeat. The US military-industrial complex has never really strayed from its Cold War course. That's the fight for which our elites have been spoiling since 1945. Asymmetrical wars don't provide the definite victories the Establishment requires to maintain power.<br><br>But I generally disagree with your take on the US strategy in Syria, JMG. I think our campaign against Islamic State is a token gesture, because Washington knows that defeating ISIS would eliminate the biggest threat to Assad. The US would probably rather see ISIS topple Assad, at which point they would be free to bomb Syria without fear of Russian reprisals. Then they could install a "moderate" (nice technical definition) regime.<br><br>Defeating ISIS would require cooperation with Assad, something the US refuses to do. Russia, on the other hand, is an Assad ally and eager to shore up his power. They also have no problem working with Iran, another nation the US won't collaborate with in Syria. <br><br>The US is paying lip service to the fight against terrorism, as you point out in your distinction between "fighting" and "defeating" ISIS. But I think the reason is they consider Assad the greater threat, if only in a geopolitical sense. If they have to choose between leaving Assad or ISIS in charge of Syria, they'll take ISIS. <br><br>The assumption is that ISIS would be easier to depose than Assad, but letting the civil war proceed that far would surely ignite a regional war, a conflict that (even by narrow US elite standards) would generate far worse consequences than the survival of the Assad regime.<br><br><a href=#c4043516039955805372 title="comment permalink">10/7/15, 8:30 PM</a><br><br>

'<br><br>Hard to tell whether this means some kinds of, for lack of a better term, bottom-level jobs have simply been replaced by other bottom-level jobs. For example, farming being replaced by bar staff (a job they say has risen). <br><br>It also doesn't say anything about pay; whether the new jobs they say have been created are better or worse paid than those that have been replaced.<br><br>They show that jobs in technology have risen, they don't take into account the obvious point that technology requires energy, and if we run of out of energy those jobs will disappear.<br><br>I'm also a little suspicious that they use absolute figures (showing the number of people employed through the decades) without seeming to take into account overall population growth. Maybe their use of the statistic 'percentage of workforce' accounts for this, but the percentage of workforce doesn't say anything about the total size of the workforce as compared to total population.

Right now, I mostly want to explore the Retrotopia narrative, but when situations like this week's news come up, something for the nonfiction fans seems like a sensible bit of variation. <br><br>Don, we'll get to that. The short form is that it defaulted on "its share" of the US national debt, which the IMF, World Bank, et al. insisted that the post-US republics all had to pay off, and so got slapped with an embargo and the attempts at regime change already mentioned. <br><br>James, true enough! If I wanted to make a complete list of the dysfunctional abstractions that substitute for reality in today's US politics, I'd be typing for a very long time. <br><br>Jonathan, the irony with calling current thought patterns "magical thinking," <a href=../../2010/06/magical-thinking.html rel=nofollow>as I've noted here in the past</a>, is that real practitioners of magic don't actually think that way; quite the contrary, repeat Rove's famous rant to any operative mage I know and the most likely suggestion you'll get is that the person who said that needs psychiatric help. That said, you're quite right -- that sort of faux-magical thinking is pandemic in the corridors of power these days, and will bring this country down in flames if it remains too long. <br><br>Dfr2010, a direct hit! How did your dinner companion(s) take that? <br><br>Patricia, best wishes for the festival! Btw, it'd be "Pat darra (whatever your mother's first name was)" -- second names in 25th century Meriga are matronymic. <br><br>Pinku-sensei, I recall a winsomely titled book from the late 1970s, I think it was: <i>Butterflies in my Stomach: The Role of Insects in Human Nutrition</i>. Having eaten fried grasshoppers, I find the idea quite palatable -- certainly more so than the crow that's going to be eaten in DC and elsewhere if the Russians pull this off. <br><br>Eric, glad to hear it. I hope the meetings are going well!<br><br>Ben, I'm pretty sure that the Russian strategy is to pound the rebels into paste and then hand things over to Assad and the Iranians, who will keep a lid on things thereafter: arguably a workable plan. (The creation of an independent Kurdistan deeply beholden to Russia and Iran, and thus likely to do a good bit of their policing for them, may also be part of the project.) As for Putin, though, exactly -- this notion that he has the least interest in what the West considers "acceptable" or "unacceptable" is really quite funny. <br><br>Juandonjuan, yes, I'd read that, and of course it's a valid point.

They normally come out when the system is already going to bits. The only question in my mind is how close we are to the point that mismanagement driven by the worship of dysfunctional abstractions pushes the US into a crisis from which it can't extricate itself. <br><br>Will, I disagree. If Obama actually wanted to cause a decline, there are many more effective ways he could do that; it's the fumbling and handwaving, the endlessly rehashed slogans, and the obsessive management of appearances that lead me to think that he and the class he represents -- including its conservative elements -- are lethally detached from reality. <br><br>Jean-Vivien, I was wondering if anyone would catch the implied reference in that last paragraph; thank you. Those "moderate Syrian rebels" really do resemble the imaginary divisions Hitler thought he could summon to the defense of Berlin!<br><br>Peteybee, as noted in response to another comment, my guess is that the Russian strategy is to kick butt, hand things over to a highly motivated local despot, and go home to the victory parade. But we'll see. <br><br>Robo, in my fictional history, they and people like them became the sole source of consumer goods in the years immediately after Partition, when the devastated Midwest was trying to rebuild some kind of basic agricultural economy and housing stock. Thereafter, some of their kids and grandkids stayed in the recycled-goods trade, while others refocused on new goods once those were available; they're doing fine now, in the stable, quietly bustling Lakeland economy. <br><br>Jason, understood. I have the spare time to follow up on stories like these, and try to put it to good use. <br><br>Frijoles, move fast. I have no idea how much time you've got left. <br><br>Repent, thanks for the data points! It's received wisdom among occultists, by the way, that when people become fixated on winning the lottery, their lives stop. They basically just sit there with slack jaws and blank eyes, waiting for the big check that never comes. It's one of the most dismal self-inflicted hexes I know of. <br><br>HalFiore, it's not just some guy with a blog. When something in the news catches my interest, I go to Google News and read anything up to fifty or sixty different news reports, from different countries and political persuasions, sorting through the propaganda and bias and trying to get a sense of the ascertainable facts. Details (such as the armament of the <i>Moskva</i>) get looked up on reputable online sources or in reference books. There's a certain amount of search string fu in getting the useful stories, but it's easily learned from experience. <br><br>Pygmycory, nobody outside the US military knows, and in all probability, they aren't going to say. They weren't dropping bombs, by the way -- they were firing a cannon with explosive shells, over and over again for more than half an hour. <br><br>Moshe, both of those are fascinating data points. Thank you. <br><br>Kevin, the F-35 and the Gerald Ford-class carriers are at the top end of the "can't fight but makes lots of money for the defense industry" sweepstakes. I wonder how many other weapons systems the US military uses are just as dysfunctional, if not quite so lucrative. As for the taking of Palmyra, well, yes, among many other examples. If the Russians succeed in taking Raqqa, it will be very interesting to hear what kind of documents they find in the rubble.<br><br><a href=#c1180766502010246020 title="comment permalink">10/7/15, 11:11 PM</a><br><br>

I trust a good time will be had by all. <br><br>Cherokee, it's ironic that there's so much discussion these days of the anniversary of the First World War because today's Allies are painfully reminiscent of that classic description of the British army on the Western Front: "Lions led by asses."

I wish I knew a way around it, but when worldviews differ -- especially when it's a matter of acceptance or rejection of a set of socially approved mythologies -- misunderstanding is usually the outcome. <br><br>Howard, exactly. In today's America, the most likely replacement for the existing order of things <a href=../../2014/02/fascism-and-future-part-three-weimar.html rel=nofollow>may just wear armbands and salute with a very stiff arm</a>. <br><br>Varun, I've seen some of the same thing. It's really quite bizarre. Yes, I'm also wondering what the Russians et al. have planned for the dark of the Moon. <br><br>NoHype, nicely summarized. If Iraq becomes part of an Iran-Iraq-Syria alliance under Russian patronage, as seems likely now, the US will have suffered its worst foreign policy defeat in my lifetime, and the political and economic consequences will be stunning. <br><br>Mickey, obviously I disagree. Certainly the US is fixated on getting rid of Assad, but I don't think it's a matter of sane geopolitics at this point, more a reflexive "Dictator <i>bad</i>!" -- that is to say, another abstraction.

My take (bear in mind I'm not employed by any geo-political military think tank, so this may be poorly informed... or not ;-) ) is that Russia's interest in Syria is pretty much the same as it was in Crimea. Latakia, meet Sevastopol. The difference is, in Syria, the incumbent regime is happy to have the Russian fleet there, Ukraine's government of the day less so. Keeping one port means protecting the incumbent, whereas keeping the other port required a change. It's all part of a replay of the 19th Century 'Great Game', imho - a big prize for Russia being access to warm-water ports, now as it was then.<br><br>Looking at the map, I shouldn't really have been surprised at the presence of a cruise-missile capable fleet there, though I was. I'm probably not alone in that... that gives a lot of coverage of the more fractious quarters of the World Island.<br><br>Maybe the most disappointing aspect is hearing British politicians repeatedly describing Putin as a 'thug'. That might just be for PR consumption, but I'm more convinced they believe it themselves, and are seriously underestimating their 'opponent'.

Russians seem to view themselves as soldiers and are proud of their military effectiveness and of their country's strength. Americans seem to see themselves mainly as moneymakers and makers of deals to make themselves more money and are proud of the technology which they hope will make them personally more money.<br><br>Even the American military seems to be infected with this attitude, hence the vast scams like the F-35 and the five hundred million dollar programme to create 'four or five' 'moderate' terrorists. I think there was a report issued on 911 and hence overlooked, that something like $2.3 trillion had disappeared from the Pentagon and just couldn't be accounted for (excluding the official 'black' programmes). Recently I think I saw that this figure is now up to about $8.5 trillion. Then there was Iraq and the pallet loads of $100 bills disbursed without any accounting. Obviously people whose only solution to problems is to literally throw money around find it hard to accept that bullets bombs and bayonets are sometimes more effective and appropriate technologies, and that other people may be more efficient in wielding them.<br><br>It's not only the military and the defence industry. The upper echelons of American society seem to feel no empathy for the rest of their people and no responsibility for the state of their country. Its all just a vast collection of looting opportunities. There's now a story from one of Hillary Clinton's guards that when she passed through a rural area she complained, 'What are we doing here?

Assad is fighting the Syrian rebels for control of Syria, and ISIS is fighting them both for control of the region. Roughly, Assad's in the east and the rebels in the west of Syria, and ISIS is operating in western Syria so it's attacking the rebels which makes ISIS the temporary ally of Assad.<br><br>Of course it's much more complicated, with Iran, Iraq, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia all having a finger in the pie, not to mention Hezbollah, Al-Nusra, the Kurds, various tribal groupings, and the religious divisions like Shia, Sunni, Alawite, Wahhabi, and Christian.<br><br>As we know, Israel pulls American foreign policy strings in the region. What does Israel want? I don't know. Israel shares a border with Syria, and occupies the Golan Heights which is Syrian territory. But AFAIK Assad has accepted the reality that Israel is too strong for him and lets sleeping dogs with tanks and missiles lie. So it's not in Israel's interests to overthrow Assad, unless they already have a deal with the rebels.

King himself graced us with his presence, and presided over the jousting tournament. After many exciting rounds, all of the contenders are now disabled - all except the winner, a new champion. Or rather, the old one; he has won all tournaments in the kingdom year after year for quite some time and defended his title this year also, even if not quite with as much ease as he did in previous years. Here he is: he just finished his celebratory round of the grounds and now stands at the edge of the jousting field, daring any and all to challenge him.<br><br>But what is this... a challenger? On foot? The crowd watches in disbelief. Does he really expect to stand a chance against a mounted knight? Doesn't he know what happened to a long string of challengers in the past?<br><br>But that does not matter. The games continue! The champion's supporters roar; some with encouragement for the champion, some with laughter at the challenger. And the champion launches into a charge!<br><br>Meanwhile his opponent quietly picks up a crossbow...<br><br>The knight charges, and what a magnificent sight he is! The shine of the armor; the flutter of the standard attached to his mount; the mount itself, a heavy horse, his steps thundering across the field; the speed at which the knight advances; everything speaks of the champion's power. The crown cheers him wildly as he passes; further down the track, the rest of the spectators boo at the challenger.<br><br>Meanwhile the challenger winds up his crossbow with practiced and purposeful motions...<br><br>The roar of the crowd subsides. The current champion ruled for so long that the recent tournaments got a bit... predictable. You wouldn't even win much if you bet your money on him. Perhaps it is time for a new champion after all? I mean, the challenger may be a mere foot soldier, but at least he still stands...<br><br>Meanwhile the foot soldier places a bolt on the crossbow and takes aim...<br><br><br><br>...and the champion is left with no good options. If he continues the charge, he will get shot - not fatally, after all the armor grants him a lot of protection, but he will still fall in front of all the crowd to see. Even if he manages to stay in the saddle and overpower the challenger, he will still be wounded and unable to compete in other tournaments. And if he stops, it will be even worse: not only will he personally yield to the challenger, but also it will become obvious that knights in general are no longer an unstoppable force.<br><br><br><br>So what is the champion to do when the rules of the game change on him? He can't just drop the lance in the middle of the field; he has become specialised in fighting from horseback. He doesn't even have any ranged weapons, since they would get in the way of performing an effective charge. In short, he never fought a fight which we was not equipped to win - until now. He cannot even withdraw from the fight - as opposed to the challenger, who can just leg it at will without his position on the scoreboard changing one single bit.<br><br>My guess would be that he would still charge and hope for the best (or more accurately, for the least bad). As long as he gets some support from the crowd, he at least has that to fight for.<br><br>MigrantWorker<br><br><a href=#c6223954559425615513 title="comment permalink">10/8/15, 5:00 AM</a><br><br>

My brother joked that the German car manufacturers should set a prize for investigative journalist to uncover similar cheatings by the Japanese automobile companies).<br><br>As taxes for cars are to some extent coupled with the rate of emissions, VW customers are also unknowingly tax evaders, and it was already claimed that the company should pay those differences as well. Furthermore, there was some deal a few years ago with the government to hold up the pretense of manufacturing cleaner cars that worked with an average rate of emissions throughout the "fleet" (that is the range of models offered by a manufacturer, allowing more gas-guzzler etc. if it is offset by sufficiently many "clean" models").

First, Russia is not any more wise in foreign policy or military action than the US. They just are in a phase where they are more agressive. I'd like to remind you that the US looked quite strong when it first waded into the wars that have now become semi-permanent drains on its resources - neither the Taliban or Saddam's military could put up much of a fight, until they reformed as unconventional forces and dragged it out. Russia may be more successful with Assad but it's far to early to cheer for Russian "strengh" or compliment them on how much better they do things than the US. They are also stepping in after the US bombing campaign, which I suspect is very much on purpose.<br><br>Secondly, Obamacare hasn't stopped the bleeding but it HAS made healthcare cheaper and more accessible to lots of people, particularly poor and near-poor people in states that accepted the medicaid expansion. Not to mention people with pre-existing conditions. A lot of people are getting healthcare for the first time in years. What it did not do is "fix" the American healthcare system, or stop the rise in costs, or weaken the corporate control of that particular trade. So people who have money are paying more, to subsidize those without money and to keep the fat cats fat.<br><br>I would say the shape of decline is not a narrowing of choices in the consumer realm, but rather a rise in prices of neccessities (rent, education, health care, transportation, and so on). There are more consumer choices than ever, but equally they are harder to find offline as amazon and other online shopping have done major damage to traditional retail. So for the wealthy, life is great, but for everyone else things have definitely gotten worse. An iPlaything is no replacement for homeownership or an education without crippling student loans. And those quality good that do exist are not easy to afford if you are putting more and more of your income into staying off the streets. <br><br>The rise in the price of neccesssities - basically, economic rent seeking - is, to my mind, perhaps the biggest issue. Income inequality is an abstract but rent is very real. When I say the rent is too damn high, people blow it off, but from my experience and what I see, even higher wages don't mean much if all of it gets sucked out by rising rents. When you say the abstract is being treated as more important than the real, what comes to mind for me is the price of rent, police brutality, and infrastructure issues. All things that are not addressed concretely even by "progressives" like Bernie Sanders. Heck, look at the marijuana issue - politicians have talked but it was outside groups that wrote the laws that were passed by the people in the West that legalized it (and it has turned out to be very simple and boring in practice). Major change simply is not coming from traditional politics anymore.<br><br><a href=#c3549811875769878549 title="comment permalink">10/8/15, 9:01 AM</a><br><br>

The Shock Doctrine was a fine piece of work. I hve not read This Changes Everything. I've read many climate books. They generally follow the same pattern. Here is how dire it is. We reach an inflection point. And presto! Solutions! Of course people differ as to whether the market or a populist groundswell will deliver them. Klein seems to fall on the groundswell side. But they always seem to end up at the same point, a green energy revolution th at allows us to continue to live exactly as we are, just emission free. I just am so tired of that nonsense, I don't have the energy to read it.

In fact, the first result might be renewed hostility between the parties -- not that there isn't a lot of that anyway. But it would plant a seed that could eventually bear fruit. The seed is the idea that the current boundaries were put in place for the convenience of colonial administration, and especially not to unite people but expressly to divide them. The fruit is that someday down the line, TPTB in these countries recognize that greater cooperation among them will pay dividends in a world dominated by superpowers. Kind of a Mideast Union counterpart to the European Union.

Plus, reading fiction as a serial is maddening.<br><br>Dysfunctional abstractions are all the rage up here in Canada too, during our federal election. A particularly odious example has come up, as the current government has decided that the abstraction of “Canadian values” can be used to evoke a fear of otherness. In this case, our government has decided to ban the wearing of the niqab at the oath taking part of the citizenship ceremony, and to explore a ban in all public services. Whipping up fear of someone’s religious beliefs is cast by our demagogues-in-training as a reasonable approach to gender equality.

That is why at least so far they have been taking out Sunni groups opposed to Assad which were largely backed by the US (e.g. the "moderates"). No doubt, they will eventually get to ISIS itself, but their goal appears to be support for their man in the region so that they can keep their military port on the Med. They also seem to be building a Shiite support group in the region. If they succeed at this, it will change the political/military landscape in the ME, making them a key player.<br><br>For the US, it isn't clear they have a strategy. Perhaps they were/are hoping for a replay of Russia in Afghanistan, hoping to bog them down in a Sunni/Shiite war. But so far at least there is no indication they have a game plan. Properly done such a plan could work, there is a great amount of Sunni-Shiite hatred to play off, and Saudi Arabia is not likely to stand by and see a strong Shiite military alliance form in their back yard.

But I digress...<br><br>See, this may explain such phenomena as Hillary's hilarious accounts of her email server which have gone something like "I wasn't watching, I wasn't there and besides I tripped." <br><br>Would a civil servant have come up with this? JMG, it only SOUNDS like amateur hour in the State Department. When you're confronted with the possibility of accusations of law-breaking, you defuse it with protestations of cluelessness.

Stay away from concrete facts, don't talk specifics, no, you say things like "I was busy, the pace and volume of work was tremendous ..."

Or was Hillary like the shop-lifter that walks zombie-like out of a store with his loot clearly visible in hand, and, if apprehended, protests his innocence, saying if he wanted to steal wouldn't he have concealed the object? No, he's no thief, he's just having a bad day. <br><br>When Wall Street stands accused of massive fraud, they say, no, it was only a massive failure of common sense. We're very, very smart which is why we're entitled to all this money. But, geez, sometimes we screw up. <br><br>Or, alternatively, when government bureaucrats stand naked and exposed to charges of monumental folly, they deny that it was folly at all. No, you see, all the apparent foolishness was to bedazzle the enemy with misdirection and deceit. See, Obama's phoney war against ISIS was just to exasperate Putin and draw Russia into a quagmire it can ill afford. <br><br>B.S. you say? Are you sure?

I mean, if you're going to lie, tell a big one. <br><br>You wonder, isn't it less trouble to show some due diligence before one acts? Yeah but you see, JMG, my experience in dealing with government is that, by and large, you're swimming against a tide of sloth and indifference. <br><br>How does government inflict so many absurdities and ludicrous injustices?

The idea that they genuinely are completely out of touch with reality and their transparently false narratives aren't simply a smokescreen to a credulous public while they wink at each other behind the scenes, but instead represent what they've internalized and sincerely discuss with each other behind closed doors, is nothing short of horrifying.<br><br>Not sure if this was a piece of the tapestry you just wove, but I think back to the popular quote from Putin's recent UN speech, "Do you even realize what you've done" or something along those lines depending on the translator.

I haven't seen any evidence that the US bombing campaign has done more than inconvenience a few stray camels. <br><br>Renovator, I'll have to take your word for it -- that wasn't a program I watched. <br><br>Johannes, that's a good example -- more abstractions ("clean emissions") generated by subterfuges and handwaving. I wonder how much of Germany's supposed success with green technologies has been produced in the same way. <br><br>Justin, that's good to hear. The Ohio River and the waterways and canals that connect to it will be of immense economic and political importance in the millennia ahead. <br><br>Thomas, they're already being asked, outside of the US. <br><br>Leo, funny! Yes, that's about right. I suspect the Ministry of Funny Policies is in there somewhere, too. <br><br>Zaphod, I think of Obama as one of history's great examples of the Peter Principle. He'd be perfectly fine in any position in which he didn't have to make crucial, reality-based decisions all the time. In such a position, he's as bad as George W. Bush and very nearly on a par with Warren Harding.<br><br>Justin, exactly. Saying "Russia is weak" doesn't change the fact that the Russians are taking decisive action and could care less what the US thinks about it. <br><br>Helix, exactly. There are plenty of other countries in which guns are readily available to the populace, but mass shootings are vastly more common here than elsewhere. Why? That's the question nobody wants to ask, because they're scared of the answer.<br><br><a href=#c2087795759110938415 title="comment permalink">10/8/15, 5:44 PM</a><br><br>

They found several Chechen clans that were willing to switch sides and work with them and got them to do most of their dirty work. David Goldman ("Spengler") had some great observations on this in one of his essays. Today, Chechen president Ramzan Kadyrov is essentially a feudal lord who swore fealty to Vladimir Putin. So long as he keeps things under control in Chechnya and doesn't get too big for his britches, he pretty much has carte blanche to run things as he sees fit. <br><br>Speaking of Kadyrov, he started his own private army, the Islamic Legion, modeled after the Légion Etrangère. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNAo-SlugrM" rel=nofollow>He offered its services to Putin</a> and noted that the Islamic Legion would be well suited for situations where it would be inadvisable for the regular Russian military to get involved.

I really wonder whether any of these buffoons have considered the possibility that when the real economy of goods and services falls apart, it won't matter how many quadrillions of dollars in derivatives they've got...<br><br>Onething, that is to say, you'd like to see the unemployment shared out more evenly. In theory, that might have been an option. <br><br>Denys, a century ago all US cities and most towns of any size had cheap, clean, effective public transit provided by streetcars and urban rail systems; parks were by and large clean and well maintained, and so were most other public works; the mail was delivered twice daily, six days a week; outside of the really big cities, there was little homelessness, because real estate was inexpensive and cheap lodging readily available; a vast number of goods and services that you can't get any more were readily available, and the quality of clothing and household goods was by and large vastly better than it is today; doctors made house calls, which cost about as much as a visit from the plumber; and so on. I could go on at great length. <br><br>Fifty-Niner, excellent! Yes, that was deliberate. Similarly, the names of the two presidents who succeeded him are deliberate jokes of equal obscurity. <br><br>Dammerung, you're assuming that mechanization actually produces additional wealth. In some cases it does so, and in that case it becomes a matter of distribution. In other cases no new wealth is created -- the machines simply do jobs that used to be done by people. Computer technology, with some minor exceptions, belongs to the second category -- it doesn't produce new wealth, it simply redistributes the existing wealth in a more unequal way. <br><br>Sven, thank you. Sometimes current events just beg for commentary. <br><br>Raven, unless the Russians or Chinese have managed to figure out how to knock nuclear weapons out of the air, that's not likely to happen. On the other hand, if somebody ever does figure that out, the US is going down very hard, and yes, war crimes trials will doubtless follow. <br><br>Adamatari, obviously I disagree. First, the Russians so far have done a far more competent job of entering into the conflict on a much less lavish budget than the US has managed for decades. Whatever happens hereafter, that's an impressive achievement. Second, Obamacare has driven up premiums to the point that many people who are eligible for insurance can't afford it, and pushed up deductibles to the point that a vast number of people who have medical insurance still can't afford medical care. On the other hand, if you want to talk about rent seeking, I won't disagree at all -- the single most important reason that life is so difficult for so many Americans is the amount of rent-seeking parasitism on every productive dimenison of the economy. <br><br>K-dog, that may well be part of it, but I wonder if that's all of it. My hunch -- and it's just a hunch -- is that there are wheels within wheels at work here.<br><br><a href=#c1150680597829707464 title="comment permalink">10/8/15, 6:08 PM</a><br><br>

As for Klein, she's playing much the same game, though from a different and somewhat more interesting angle. <br><br>Helix, in the best of all possible worlds...<br><br>Keith, "Canadian values" -- oog. Down here it was "family values." Both phrases basically function as excuses to hate. <br><br>Gwizard43, for some individuals, in some situations, leaving the US could be a viable option. Stop for a moment, though, and ask yourself this: the way the US is behaving these days, what kind of a welcome do you think expatriate Americans are going to face in much of the world as the US goes further down its current road? The pervasive fantasy of entitlement, by which so many Americans convince themselves that they ought to get whatever they want and be welcomed wherever they want to go, may not be a useful guide any more, if it ever was. <br><br>Team10tim, er, do you realize how arrogant that first statement of yours comes across -- as though nobody who read Klein's book can possibly find it shallow and meretricious? As for the rest, that'll wait for the review, thank you. <br><br>William, when I say that Obamacare has made medical care more expensive and less available, that's not disproven by pointing out that some people benefit from it. A lot more have been harmed by it, and soaring premiums and sky-high deductibles are a very large part of the reason why. <br><br>LatheChuck, until and unless an independent international body investigates the Kunduz hospital airstrike, I for one won't believe anybody's story. As for Klein, good -- that's the standard logic these days on the left. "X is bad, therefore anything but X must be an improvement!"

More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Clay, I've noticed that a lot of Americans have a hard time keeping track of the fact that the survival of industrial civilization and the survival of the United States are not the same thing. Could the US plunge into a really disastrous political and economic crisis overnight, mismanage the response catastrophically, and devolve into a Third World failed state? Sure. Does that mean that everyone else in the world would jump in after us? Not a chance. As I've been pointing out for a very long time, the US in particular is close to crisis, and its implosion will likely bring about a period of global politics and economics as difficult, and as bloody, as the one that ran from 1914 to 1954 -- you know, the two world wars, the Great Depression, the rise of Communism, the end of European colonial empires, et al.?

You're right, though: if Nylarlathotep, the crawling chaos, the soul and herald of the Great Old Ones, were to rise up before us in his crimson robes and utter words of chill import sufficient to strike terror into the hardiest soul, I doubt he could do better than to simply state the obvious fact that the people in charge of the United States of America are living in a dreamworld of dysfunctional abstractions, living lives so detached from the rest of the cosmos that they really have no idea what effects their policies are having. <br><br>Jason, I get suspicious anytime anybody spends their time weeping about climate change.

A friend of mine, working as a service person during the dedication of Bill Clinton's Presidential Library, overheard Rove say a more extreme version of the same thing to George W Bush: roughly, the American President and his advisors make and unmake reality; it is they alone who get to say what is real and what isn't, who give shape and form to reality as they see fit.<br><br>There's a long, long backstory to this very widespread attitude in American culture. It begins with the American Swedenborg churches and Mesmerism. It picks up steam with Phineas Parkhurst Quimby, Mary Baker Eddy, Emma Curtis Hopkins (and Malinda Eliot Cramer on the West Coast). It finds its first institutional homes in Christian Science and the various religions of the New Thought movement. It is reformulated in openly magical language by William Walker Atkinson (also known as Theron Q. Dumont, Theodore Sheldon, Yogi Ramacharaka, and at least one of the "Three Initiates" who wrote _The Kybalion_), and then by Al G Manning. And finally it entered mainstream (nominally Christian) culture with Dale Carnegie, Norman Vincent Peale, and now _The Secret_. Even today, in the early 21st century, it retains its hold on a very large number of Americans.<br><br>This odd American point of view seems (to me) to be a complete mystery to most Europeans, who were never heavily influenced by these 19th-century American authors and movements.<br><br>I grew up in that world, and I learned my first magic there. (So did Dion Fortune and several other well-known writers on magic and esoterica.) So I can say with some assurance that the first principle underlying all its thought is this: the physical world of matter and energy, in time and space, is nothing more than an old collective hallucination, an alluring delusion, a total illusion. Only thought, mind, spirit, etc., have any reality at all, any permanence. (As I grew up and learned more about magic, I discovered just how false that first principle is, though I still have a sort of emotional attachment to it as a hangover from my childhood.)<br><br>People, even Americans who were not born into that sector of American culture, who were not raised in it, may find it hard to fathom how anyone could actually believe such things. However, they do believe them, even when they later give lip-service to mainstream views as a form of protective coloring. And I expect that careful genealogical research would discover that a sizeable fraction of our elite politicians and would-be statesmen are descended from parents and grandparents who had read these authors and joined these movements; and they have a sort of "mind-over-matter hangover" inherited from their forbears.<br><br><a href=#c5060191808582130195 title="comment permalink">10/8/15, 7:02 PM</a><br><br>

So the American military could end up losing its much vaunted technological superiority as well and find itself outgunned and outclassed on the battlefields of the near future if the US is stupid enough to blunder into a war with Russia.<br><br>PS You mentioned that if the Chinese or Russians found a way to neutralize the American nuclear deterrent, we could see America come crashing down in a hurry. <br><br>The Brazilian journalist and political commentator Pepe Escobar has been arguing that once the Russians start deploying the S-500 Prometheus in large numbers, Russia will become effectively invulnerable to American ballistic and cruise missile strikes. While such claims need to be taken with a large truckload of sodium chloride, its worth noting that it was Obama's predecessor that made that particular nightmare a possibility by unilaterally abrogating the ABM Treaty and ignoring Russia's warnings about the possible consequences of doing so and that Obama has done nothing to reverse that decision.<br><br><a href=#c2884620070670464918 title="comment permalink">10/8/15, 7:28 PM</a><br><br>

These are merely the questions and musings of one ignorant American. <br>In the short term, it seems Russia and China are outmaneuvering, or at least working hard to outmaneuver, America in the squabble over the remaining resources of our finite planet.<br>But are the Russian and Chinese leadership actually any wiser when it comes to facing the reality of planetary limits and peak oil? Even if their societies are less dependent on fossil fuels than our own, they too are part of world industrial civilization, dependent on its common way of doing things, and will be forced to downgrade their economies and lifestyles as it comes unglued. I should think facing up to this fact is as unpalatable to their elites as it is to ours- not to mention the rest of their society. I wonder as well, will winning geopolitical battles at this point in the arc of decline help a nation longer term, or will the nation be better off that collapses first and avoids the rush, willingly or otherwise? Will the nation(s) that ends up more powerful in the final round(s) of collapse end up better off in a dark age, worse, or is it impossible to say?<br><br>On a personal note I must thank you, John Michael Greer, for the good you have done for me and my family. Your blog helped inspire my mother and grandmother to revitalize our family farm in Alabama. When I am home, we often read the weekly posts aloud, and they have sparked many a lively debate. Your writings on magic have given me a new perspective on the interesting clash between my very academically centered upbringing (everyone on my mother’s side and many on my father’s are Ph.D.s or equivalent) and the needs of the physical discipline that is my profession and passion, classical ballet. Ballet teaches one a thing or two about abstractions, reality, and the relationship between the two that scholars often, in my experience, fail to face. I don’t know what chance my art form has in a collapse, but their is some hope for it- it survived the French Revolution, and actually ended up thriving after several communist revolutions. <br>I must say I cannot see the future. I do not know where our civilization is headed, the degree to which your forecasts are right or wrong. But the fine details are irrelevant- the central point of this blog is clear. Our society is dependent on fossil fuels- these are being used up- we do not at present have an energy source with which to replace them. Thus, it is in our interests, individually and collectively, to use less. That is enough for me to try to work on changing my lifestyle, to the extent I can.<br><br><br><a href=#c8542171083190166421 title="comment permalink">10/8/15, 9:24 PM</a><br><br>

It's always good to hear from someone who's made constructive use of these essays. With regard to your point about Russia and China, of course you're quite correct; whoever comes out on top this time around will be the target du jour in the next round of crises, if they last that long. In the long run no nation wins the game of Decline and Fall; it's just a matter of the shape of the trajectory, and that's hard to predict. "Collapse now and avoid the rush" is intended as advice for individuals, families, and local communities. Above that scale, I'm far from sure that any advice will help much. <br><br>Tye, of course there's more going on than I could fit into one weekly post! You're right, though, that Putin isn't the final victor.

The first is called 'The Coddling of the American Mind' at http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind/399356/ which talks about how, in the name of emotional well-being, college students are increasingly demanding protection from words and ideas they don’t like which is having a chilling effect on what their teachers can even mention in class.<br> <br> The second is called 'The Disadvantages of an Elite Education' at https://theamericanscholar.org/the-disadvantages-of-an-elite-education/ and is an extensive article on the warped values that are instilled on our 'elite' in places of higher education who's students now, apparently, cannot even stand the idea of solitude or intimacy.<br> <br> Don't get me wrong. This is not just an American phenomena. Not even close.

I finally came across your oft mentioned Conan quote from Beyond the Black River: "Civilisation is unnatural. It is a whim of circumstance. And barbarism must always triumph". Unfortunately, I recall that another commenter mentioned that quote a few weeks back, but it is worth repeating for its sheer elan!<br><br>Speaking of dud leadership but good fighting forces, another quote from that story comes to hand: "The river could be patrolled constantly. But the Government wouldn't do it. Soft-bellied fools sitting on velvet cushions with naked girls offering them ice wine on their knees - I know the breed. They can't see any farther than their palace wall. Diplomacy - hell! They'd fight picts with theories of territorial expansion. Valannus and men like him have to obey the orders of a set of damned fools. They'll never grab any more Pictish land, any more than they'll ever rebuild Venarium. The time may come when they'll see the barbarians swarming over the walls of the Eastern cities!”<br><br>Very relevant to today, I reckon.<br><br>As a funny side story, I was enjoying a quiet coffee Thursday morning after picking up the mail and weekly supply of fresh milk, and reading that story (it is an impressive looking beautifully bound and massive book) and chuckling quietly to myself and was interrupted by a lovely older lady who asked me - from a sense of curiosity I suspect - what I was reading that was making me chuckle so. After a short conversation I believe that I failed to convince her that it really was a rollicking good story.<br><br>The weather here has truly reached the bizarre stage because I sat on the veranda this afternoon and watched what appeared to me to be a monsoon - accompanied with large hail - dump a short, sharp and heavy rainstorm over the farm - after which the sun reappeared as hot as before the storm.

One is that a defeat of ISIS would largely remove the pretext for US presence and military action in the region and we can't have that can we? <br><br>Another is that the US's regional allies such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Turkey and perhaps Israel have been supporting ISIS pretty directly. I'm willing to bet that if the money used to buy all those Toyota trucks was traced, it would point back to the Gulf Monarchies somewhere. <br><br>Another reason is that US presence in the region is geared around Regime Change, not fighting ISIS which is probably another factor in why the attacks haven't been too effective. Sure, the US has been attempting to prune the bad bits like a metaphorical rose bush, but I certainly wouldn't want someone of that level of incompetence let loose in my garden. <br><br>There's also the fact of the DIA report available at Judicial Watch that clearly demonstrates that the US Government knew the "Rebels" they were trying to pass off as "Moderates" were dominated by Salafist/Al Nusra/Muslim Brotherhood types, that this support would result in some kind of "Caliphate" and that to the West and it's regional allies this was a desirable outcome. <br><br>So all things considered, ISIS is a creation of Western - mainly US - foreign policy and although there isn't a unified policy within the US establishment, their tendency to double down on failing strategies is continuing to drive it forward. It's interesting that Obama commissioned a study to ascertain if arming "rebels" or whatever had ever had a positive outcome (considering that the US has been doing this since Afghanistan in the 70s and we ended up with the Taliban and al Qaeda). The CIA (I think) who did the study basically came back and said that no, it never turned out well and on the contrary has consistently been a negative disaster. Obama's reaction? You guessed it. More of the same. I've lost count of the amount of times that competent field agents and analysts warned against such policies and were overruled by the Executive.<br><br>It's been interesting watching people like Samantha Power declare that "Russian bombing will provoke Extremism" as though US bombs are somehow blowback immune. I do also feel that Putin won't make the same mistakes of Afghanistan in the 80's and Chechnya and they're working on the basis of a proper strategy and better intelligence than the US. Putin doesn't want a confrontation with the West and it looks to me as though they're pushing towards a situation that will force a peace settlement in which Assad will remain for the time being and not create a power vacuum. <br><br>As for the Kunduz bombing, it's definitely deliberate and my best guess at this stage is that it's punishment for the MSF policy of treating the wounded of the "other side" in a conflict as well as the designated "good guys", and it will be followed by an attempt to use the event as a precedent to establish "legality" - the kind of legal approval you only get when you pay a flack for the express purpose of coming up with a convoluted way to declare the indefensible, legal. <br><br>I agree that had it not been deliberate, an attempt at apology would have been made - although as you suggest, it would be treated as nothing more than a PR problem with some rhetoric followed by an investigation in which "failings" are discovered but no-one is actually held accountable except perhaps some low ranking fall guy, and a bit of cash chucked at the victims families after a long drawn out process culminating sometime in 2023. <br><br><br><br><a href=#c2665235176792353913 title="comment permalink">10/9/15, 5:44 AM</a><br><br>

The secret services were inefficient. No wonder - NSA &amp; Co have taken the habit of spying on their own civil population and on their servile vassals. Sending "national security letters" to US companies, requesting backdoors and server access is not effective against a nonconforming opponent. Perhaps they start to understand that Putin's aquisition of old-fashioned typewriters was not a PR gag?<br><br>- the cruise missiles hit their targets at a distance of 1500km. Go to the south of the Caspian Sea and draw a circle with a radius of 1500km around it. Lo and behold, the whole Persion Gulf is in range! Putin has just told the US that their aircraft carriers are fish in case of a confrontation.<br><br>- the S300 air defense systems would make a hard opponent for the USAF.<br><br>- the US war strategy over the last decades has been: Sent bombers, bomb the whole target country to the ground, destroy every defensive capabilities as well as civilian infrastructure. When the enemy is helpless, ground troops may be sent. The two points before have just told the US "your strategy has passed its pull date".<br><br>- the 2002 manoeuvre desaster ("millenium challenge") was 13 years ago. It's only now that the US elite starts to grasp that changing the rules of a manoeuvre just might not be a winning strategy against a non-complying opponent. Reality can be such a b..ee.<br><br>- the US have more military toys than Russia, but if some cruise missiles could be used to sink a carrier fleet, Russia's somewhat weaker economy would have to produce so much less than the US in such a war that the economic outcome would imply an American defeat.<br><br>The helplessness of the Western reactions deserves some popcorn:<br><br>- The US complain that Russia didn't announce the strikes. Oh no, what a surprise - perhaps Russia didn't want the US to give word to the ISIS forces for carrying some civilians to the targets? And when have the US ever announced airstrikes to Russia? Entitlement dreams blowing up!<br><br>- NATO secretary Stoltenberg complains that Russia is using up to date weaponry (not that long before, he complained that Russia's weaponry was outdated). Why, does that mean the NATO hadn't used up to date weaponry? If so, why not?<br><br>- Some days ago, Brzezinski claimed Russia would be helpless in that area if cut off from home. Think again.<br><br>conclusion: the US just realised they have been caught with their pants down. Plus that Iraq and Iran (full of oil that rightfully should belong to the US!!11) are lining up with Russia. Let's see when they will throw out the petro-dollar (and let's prepare a lorry full of popcorn for that day).<br><br>If the European vassal regimes were not so utterly senile and corrupt as they are, they would recognise it's high time to re-adjust their politics towards Russia.<br><br><br>@ JMG: <i>"what would a competent commander do if tasked to do what Putin says Russia is going to do?"</i><br><br>There are certainly some competent officers in the US military - given the sheer numbers, that's a safe statistical bet. The problem is that it's part of the senility of the elites that they don't recognise them. Moreover, it is also part of the elites' senility that they prefer to listen to incompetent leaders who are in line with the elites' dream world than to listen to a competent one who isn't.<br><br>It wouldn't even astonish me if most of the top level ranks in the US military aren't there because they are competent leaders, but because they are good at demanding things from the tax payer which make sure that the tax dollars get channelled to the "right" companies - see e.g. the KC-46A tanker aircraft affair where the USAF ended up with a second class tanker aircraft. Only that this isn't exactly the most useful skill in case of a confrontation with a serious opponent.<br><br><a href=#c8978762695653513268 title="comment permalink">10/9/15, 7:13 AM</a><br><br>

It is a bit outdated, and firmly framed in the Abundance Capitalism paradigm, but even back then it was clear that automation never was not such a fantastic idea. The story is about one Alex Rogo, manager with actual technical chops, who sets out to save his and his men's jobs by reorganizing the factory floor in a financially distressed American company. Not a work of high art, but an entertaining and enlightening read if you ask me.<br><br>The reason I think this is relevant is because it highlight a pervasive bias of ideological origin amongst the moneyed class. The reason to exist for complex machinery (aka automation) is to displace labor, period. It does not matter that it cost more to do that, this is a fact already known to the executives. The bias is the thing that says that there are two kinds of expenses: salaries are *bad* and capital investment is *good*, even if it costs more. <br><br>This bias is enforced by accounting practices. Good costs (automation) are recorded as investment and not seen as an expense at all. They are thought to "accumulate" in the assets sheet. Bad costs (aka salaries) are recorded in the books as money leaving the company (energy moving off-system). Even worse, since employees keep earning a salary every week/month, they are recorded in the liabilities sheet.<br><br>Of course, entries in the assets sheet are not really valuable just by themselves (unless you are a corporate raider with an eye to hostile take over and liquidation of the company, but that's another story). So, once you have fallen in the trap of recording your automation expenses in the asset sheet, you will experience pressure to make those assets pay for themselves.

I chose the silver, which was essentially the same, in fact, exactly the same as I had had with my employer. What Obamacare did for me was decouple my job from my insurance, for which I have been very grateful, as my job was sort of killing me, but you have to keep so many hours per week to qualify for employer-assisted insurance. And for some reason, with Obamacare, those required hours increased from 20, to 24, to 30.<br><br>I was able to change to 2 part-time jobs and get the insurance through the Marketplace (Obamacare). I had to pay a monthly fee, but I saw that the bronze plan was useless. Also, the premium was about the same as I had paid through my employer. However, the next year the premium more than doubled, unconnected to my income. At that time, due to changes made in my life, we now qualified for medicaid. With medicaid, all was free, although we have not used any healthcare except for my once in 6 months appointment. Husband does not go.<br><br>But then, a couple of months ago, we got a confusing set of brochures in the mail, via medicaid, telling us to choose from one of three insurance companies. I was confused, called the medicaid office, and the person there was obviously incensed by the whole thing and said, "They are giving us a number for people to call. We don't know anything about this, and they did not tell us!"<br><br>So, it appears we have all been handed over to the insurance companies! <br><br>Obamacare has personally benefited me but I've been annoyed for years the way people focus on getting insurance, when the costs of medical care are so outrageous. Indeed, Obama said while he was campaigning in '08 that if the costs were not contained they would eventually bankrupt the nation. As recently as 2001-2003 I was able to purchase as an individual, for myself and 3 kids, good coverage for 300 monthly, then it went up 50 per year. Now, for a family of 4, it costs well over a thousand.<br><br><a href=#c2605893516558095869 title="comment permalink">10/9/15, 7:53 AM</a><br><br>

The adults of a century ago are as culturally different from us today as the we are from the Chinese or the Russians of today. I believe some of what we experience is as much to do as how we treat each other with such contempt these days. People dismiss people who don't agree with them and have long lists of grievances and grudges. People in 1910 couldn't afford to do that - work needed to be done and many hands were required to do it. There was no way to buy your way out of work. If you wanted apple pie, you peeled the apples, sliced, cooked and baked them. No quick run to the grocery store for it.<br><br>I really don't see much interest in people in working these days. And what people consider work is laughable. How does sitting around a table talking, then emailing a bunch of people for hours qualify as "work"? Obviously people are busy. We hear a lot about how busy everyone is. But work. No way.

They assure me that it is making healthcare cheaper and more affordable for people and find it very inconvenient that my personal experience does not match the reports they read. As a veterinarian, my wife used to get insurance through the AVMA. Because of Obamacare that reasonably priced plan (relatively speaking) disappeared. It was a PPO which had a lot less hoops to jump through than the overpriced HMO she now gets through her employer.<br><br>When I tell people I don't have insurance they recommend I get it through the exchange. The cheapest plan for someone my age is over $350 a month. For someone who would treat all but the most severe illnesses with alternative medicines, it makes no sense for me to purchase this. So I have to weigh the cost of buying insurance (which still won't cover much due to deductables, copays, and all kinds of complicated abstractions that make me feel a bit ill just thinking about them), vs paying the penalty. For me this is not some kind of abstract wonky discussion about health care. It is an issue that directly affects my life. I get that it made a few needed fixes to the system, but those are very few and I live in a state that already had those laws in place. This is such a great example of people being attached to abstraction. A lot of my friends on the left see this as some kind of step towards universal single payer healthcare, when it is nothing of the sort.<br><br>I do hope the medical bubble pops and soon. It drives me nuts that I have to pay a fine for not buying health insurance I won't use. At some point the penalty will cost more than the insurance and I will just have to buy.

But, I have been always been somewhat confused by the choice of Jameson Weed for the president’s name. On the surface, I’ve always understood that it is a reference to the perceptual effects of toying with the plant by westerners and the delusions of the senile political elite. At the same time, I’ve read about how the plant was used by indigenous peoples here in North America. Particularly, it was used in rites of passage for young men, by other tribal members in other rituals, and was used by shamans for magical spirit flights. It was used medicinally as a pain reliever, as a sort of antivenin against poisonous bites, and to alleviate bronchial and nasal congestion. It was also used to increase strength and stamina, and alleviate hunger while hunting or on other extended travels. The Nahuatl word for the plant is rendered as toloache, which roughly means to bow one’s head in reverence. So, the plant was highly respected, if not the subject of outright worship.<br><br>Given your broad background and respect for the spiritual methods and practices of others, as well as druidic work with plants, and considering the relationship that indigenous peoples had with the plant, this name choice for the president as a deliberate joke has never made sense to me and seems a little dismissive.<br><br>Maybe I’m just a little daft and over-sensitive, but please understand that this comes from a place of sincere respect.<br><br>Best regards,<br><br>valekeeperx<br><br><a href=#c9044520137764237802 title="comment permalink">10/9/15, 2:07 PM</a><br><br>

Solomon at SNAFU pointed out that because the US military is so highly centralized and bureaucratic, with a risk averse, “zero defects” mindset, every airstrike has to be approved by a senior officer, a full colonel or a navy captain if not a general or admiral. So yes, this was probably an attack that was personally approved by someone high up in the chain of command, someone with a lot of political influence, and now they are desperately trying to obfuscate what really happened.<br><br>I have also heard from people I know in the military that one of the reasons why the American air campaign against Daesh has been so ineffective is because of over-centralization. Since a senior officer must personally approve each airstrike, it can take hours for a strike to be approved. It doesn’t help that these senior officers are almost invariably sitting in an air conditioned headquarters hundreds or even thousands of miles from the scene of the action. Micromanagement and technology worship at it worst.<br><br>I have heard lots of stories of American pilots who saw a nice juicy target, like a large truck convoy, an obvious defensive position or a sizeable troop concentration, but circled overhead for hours waiting for permission to strike. In many cases, the target was already gone or the planes had already returned to base because they were low on fuel by the time permission was given. Or someone high up in the chain of command denied permission to carry out the strike and a high value target was allowed to get away while the American aviators fumed in vain. So the fact that Daesh was able to successfully capture Palmyra in spite of having to travel over 150 km in terrain perfectly exposed to air attacks does not surprise me in the least.<br><br><a href=#c6858594339035408385 title="comment permalink">10/9/15, 2:08 PM</a><br><br>

The sad thing is that the US is always about 5 to 10 years ahead of us down here on such progressive reforms. ;-)!<br><br>And just in case the housing bubble has dropped off peoples radar, I spotted this article: <a href=http://www.theage.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/average-victorian-home-loan-jumps-61700-in-a-year-20151009-gk5qur.html rel=nofollow>Average Victorian home loan jumps $61,700 in a year</a>. No need to read the article because the title really tells it all and my choice quote was:<br><br>"The average new loan for an owner-occupier in the state has increased nearly 20 per cent in the year to August to $378,100, official figures showed on Friday.<br><br>This is faster than the 10.6 per cent lift in Melbourne home prices over the same period, and the strong growth suggests many buyers are responding to record low interest rates by borrowing more."<br><br>What that suggests to me is that the increase in the supply of money has far outstripped any underlying growth in real world income. It is hardly surprising given our main exports: coal, iron ore and gas have all plummeted in price, but nobody seems to want to take a hit to their incomes. What could possibly go wrong? <br><br>Oh well, when the inevitable riots take place, at least the police will have taser drones at their disposal, but then they will probably be impacted by the economic bubble explosion too and may feel some serious sympathies for their fellow humans. Where will the anger be directed is an interesting question.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c76384615158098978 title="comment permalink">10/9/15, 3:26 PM</a><br><br>

Phrasing it as "defeating Islamic State" would merely bring into play a different kind of dysfunctional abstraction, one that's increasingly common and particularly frustrating: the pretense of dictating outcomes.<br><br>Certain executives have always had the privilege of declaring what they want to happen, and leaving it up to others to figure out how. In government, the very process of making laws encourages that kind of thinking. News reporters generally play along. They'll write something like "This new law will keep guns out of our schools," as though the text is going to leap off the pages of the <i>Congressional Record</i> and grab the firearms out of shooters' hands, instead of whatever the law actually dictates (such as, a zero tolerance policy that requires third grade students be punished for pointing a finger and saying 'bang!' in the schoolyard).<br><br>But, executives are supposed to have underlings who immediately translate the "what's supposed to happen" into concrete measures that are both practicable, and likely to have the requested outcome. They might often fail at achieving the latter part, but they're supposed to at least try. More and more, instead, the requested outcome itself just gets passed down the chain of command. "We need more customers!" from corporate management doesn't turn into improved products, better service, more attractive prices, or even more advertising; instead, the minimum wage employee at the counter finds his performance suddenly being evaluated by how many customers come to the counter, something he has (assuming he's not driving them away with abusive behavior) no control over.<br><br>At the big box chain store my wife works at, there are many formal "policies" that sales people are supposed to follow without exception to improve customer satisfaction. One is that each customer must receive the sales person's undivided attention for as long as they need it. Another is that no customer may be kept waiting for a sales person's attention. These absolute dictates obviously become mutually contradictory the moment two or more customers show up at the same time. Both of those policies are clearly desirable in the ideal case, but rather than take measures to ensure that they are practicable (e.g. by arranging for adequate staffing at peak times), the corporation merely demands the employee make good whether it's possible or not.<br><br>As a result, all the policies become a joke (in a manner that reminds me of production quotas in the former Soviet Union), as the store managers have no choice but to report back to Corporate that of course every one of them is being followed to the letter. Meanwhile, it should be no surprise that at some stores in the same chain, the service is poor even when staff is available. A fact that Corporate no doubt finds perpetually bewildering...<br><br>And my wife's is, by today's standards at least, a good service-sector job at a good and genuinely useful store where she enjoys helping people with real needs. Things are clearly much worse elsewhere.<br><br>I can't help wondering if something similar is happening in the U.S. military chain of command. For example, that the individual infantryman is being ordered simultaneously to carry out assigned missions regardless of adversity using all force necessary, and to avoid harming civilians at all costs. After all when you're "an army of one" you can do two different contradictory things simultaneously, right?<br><br><a href=#c484463183686444824 title="comment permalink">10/9/15, 3:50 PM</a><br><br>

I think we're actually worse off than that today! At least the beatings represent an attempt, as misguided and counterproductive as the joke implies, to address the actual problem. Today's version would be "We've hired a top consulting firm to perform quarterly morale surveys, from which we'll compute monthly morale improvement targets and organize low-morale-coping-skills workshops where we'll talk about the problem until it goes away by itself." That program would then be quietly discontinued after two quarters, after 62% of participants polled respond, "we prefer the beatings, thanks."<br><br>One more thing about the habit of blindly dictating outcomes: it does appear to parallel, and could be related to, the growth of the complexity of technology. When the user sets the dials (so to speak) for the immediate needs of the task at hand, a simpler tool suffices, but the operator has to know what she's doing. Tools become far more complex when they're designed to allow the user to directly specify the desired end result instead. Those complex tools put us into the role of clueless executives demanding results without understanding or contributing to them. Does that train us to prefer abstractions?<br><br>Decades ago, noticing these trends of technology not only being misused but seemingly being deliberately designed to encourage misuse, I formulated "Freitag's Law" (yes, sophomorically named for myself). Which is: "Never use a tool that's more intelligent than you are."<br><br>It was a joke, back then.<br><br><a href=#c2683540378260249367 title="comment permalink">10/9/15, 3:52 PM</a><br><br>

In a sense, maybe one could postulate that rising wages cause automation. You can see this happening in china right now, in near hyperspeed, by the way, re labor first, then increasing automation. I just automated a guy's job out of existence. Cost? About his yearly salary. The replacement is faster, more accurate, and scales up without an issue. He was a single point of failure for the firm.<br><br>I find a very useful antidote to the complete nonsense being spewed by the US media to be rt.com, I like that site, as do many others, enough for the US government to attempt their own lame version of anti russian web site. But the US gov doesn't grasp that one big reason rt.com is popular in the west is that it's consistently anticorporate, particularly anti-US Finance corporate. I'll resist the temptation to hold my breath until the US gov funds a similarly anticorporate state media resource. One thing I like about state run sites like rt.com, al jazeera, bbc, and so on, is that their biases are clear and fairly open, they are biased towards the state that runs them, so it's easy to just skip that type of weighting.<br><br>One thing that wasn't emphasized in your overview this week was the intensely corrupting influence of what Eisenhower so astutely warned about, the military industrial complex, a term now so familiar that we stop realizing just why he warned about that, it was precisely for the reasons we see today: military engagements carried out in order to maximize two things: current military industrial profits, ie, weapons sales, using up weapons systems, replacing parts, etc, and to guarantee the generals who decide x today a future position as a high paid advisor/lobbyist for the same contracting firms their decisions profit today. <br><br>China and Russia, and India, to a lesser extent, you can be absolutely sure, are hyper aware of this fact, all their recent weapons systems development is clearly aimed at highly defensive focused, but also very robust and cost effective strategy.<br><br>Re the Russian Syria engagement, that's no mystery at all, Putin met with Obama a bit over a week ago, and a week later, the Russian engagement began. That doesn't require rocket science to understand. It does lead one to wonder if Obama finally realized he is essentially powerless to change the US system from within, and basically just gave Putin the go ahead to actually deal competently with the syrian situation. Obama does after all detest Netanyahu if I remember right, and may not be as fond of the Israeli lobby as others in the US administration. I know, I know, I'm trying to find even a hint of spine or active intelligence in Obama, but I have to suspect there there may be a touch there.<br><br>I can't personally stand pseudo-intellectuals like Naomi Klein, I've read that type of stuff off and on my entire life, and it's always the same, roughly: provide a decent overview or analysis (at best, for this type of writing), then have some totally absurd, highly fantasy based 'what to do about it' last chapter or two. One thing I find particularly irksome about her and her ilk is their extreme fondness for using air travel, for self promotion usually, while preaching to the choir about climate change. I believe you occupy a tiny subset, numbered possibly in the sub 10s, globally, of people who are A: aware of the situation, and publishing about it, and B: live their lives consistent with that awareness, ie, no car, no air travel unless absolutely necessary, etc.<br><br><a href=#c927315876123867779 title="comment permalink">10/9/15, 4:13 PM</a><br><br>

It's far more horrifying that the theory that really fits their actions is that they really are that incompetent and really do believe their own nonsensical rubbish. <br><br>The first glimpse of this horror I found was in John Perkins's "Confessions Of An Economic Hit Man". While the tales he tells of his work as a 'e-hit man' bring a tsunami of emotional outrage and salacious impact; what I found most important and again horrifying, was explanation that these big shots, these global movers and shakers are not the plotting monsters we'd expect. They're just humans, with families, dogs, kids... who are smart and really good at the game, but not prescient enough to REALLY see or digest the destruction they are wreaking, nor the inevitable blowback it will have on all of us, including themselves. They also wear blinders of distraction. Insomuch as there is a conspiracy: They are just really powerful people who's interests sometimes align, so they work together - to gain MORE money and power. They cannot see and our societal narrative has never allowed for 'enough is enough'. No matter how powerful they are - they want more. An oversimplified way of saying it is - in terms of power - they are penny-wise and pound-foolish. I'm sure there are more succinct and appropriate quotes, but at the moment, they elude me.<br><br>The one bright, (light) spot in this week's essay was the reference to Naomi Klein. I was blown away by 'The Shock Doctrine', it was incredible work. Yes, especially for an author capable of that - 'This Changes Everything' was an embarrassment. I read it some time before I found the ARD and this forum of ideas - and still as I was reading it, I couldn't help thinking Naomi herself was spinning her own delusion. She's lost it. She can't face the reality that this problem IS too big for us to tackle, (at least in the established methods we, (she) know and accept). Unfortunately, my sweet son bought me that book for my birthday, with his own first-job money - I'll never be able to chuck it!!

Are you all middle class or upper middle class people living in red states? Seriously. We're living below the poverty line in Washington State. A blue state, which accepted the Medicaid support. WA added dental coverage to the ACA. My military retirement health coverage is great, and satisfies the ACA insurance requirement, but does not cover dental. So, we are eligible for the State Dental coverage at no cost to us, due to income level.<br><br>My brother and his wife (contractor and nurse) are also living slightly below the poverty line. Before the ACA they paid over $500 a month for catastrophic only coverage with a $5K deductible. They now have complete coverage at no cost to them. The biggest winner is the local hospital, which now gets paid by Medicaid for treating their family; formerly since they were so poor, the hospital would not charge them for urgent care.<br><br>So in Washington State the ACA has been a clear improvement for very poor people and the rural hospitals. YMMV.<br><br>Yes, it's paid for by taxes. Which we pay a great deal of our income in. Washington's tax structure is one of the most regressive in the nation; property, sales and Business and Occupancy tax, but no graduated income tax.

I have a lot of thoughts and replies this week, but I'll just add one more:<br><br>As I work in one of those factories churning out clueless elites. Of course, you know - we're not trying to produce dunderheads, but most of the establishment, (admin, faculty and parents) can't seem to get past the ideal of offering MORE opportunity, more protection from anything bad, making things easier, more entertaining, more immediately fulfilling to the kids. (Your lesson plan is not fun enough. You're not engaging them enough, not making it exciting enough…) They want the kids to soar like eagles, but they don't want them to have to suffer the hard work of building up the muscle in their wings. After all; it's 2015! Technology! We've surely found an app for that by now, no?! Socially; the kids are in a bubble - the adults around them want to protect them totally - and the CAN, so they do. They're simply not exposed to very much in life that is hard or negative or doesn't go their way. Academically, it's a great education, but in life-skills, it simply cannot be, because we grow and become stronger from hardship, not ease. Sadly, the academics themselves are not even accessible without some boring work put in, so they are also often lost on the kids.<br><br>I adore my little students, I often feel like the subversive Auntie trying to sneak in tangible skills and more importantly the idea that nothing worthwhile in life is easy. To really enjoy making art, music, playing a sport, anything - you have to build up your skill and muscle and there's just no getting around it - it's hard, boring, slogging, tedious work before you can actually fly. You also have to get your hands dirty, but so what? You can wash them. Such is life. I know I sound like an old meanie; a Calvinist, Victorian, tight-lipped spinster, but IMHO, by providing so much for them, we are failing them. On the social interactions front: well, that could take a whole blog in itself!<br><br>My students come from the privileged class. In any collapse, some of the parents may have the means to withstand a lot of bad weather. They may be OK, but I do really worry for them.

Maybe they can rename the F-35 the Flying Edsel -- though the name I coined for it in <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i>, the Lardbucket, is probably closer to what the pilots will call it once it goes into service. <br><br>Kevin, I grant that it's not solely an American thing -- in particular, I've heard utterances from Tory politicians in the UK that push the borders of clueless absurdity at least as far as anything US politicians have said. <br><br>Scotlyn, funny.

Someone in the Pentagon realizes what the score is -- and knows that one US carrier sent to the bottom by cruise missiles is all it would take to pop the bubble of US global power forever. <br><br>Onething, that's exactly what I'm talking about. You've got to reduce hours worked by a quarter, you have everyone go to 30 hours a week rather than laying off one person in four. <br><br>Raymond, exactly.

Yes, it'll go beyond the fantasy-island talk about powering a modern upper middle class lifestyle on wind and sun. <br><br>Varun, the Democrats may be crowing but their anointed front runner loses in polls when matched up against most of the plausible GOP candidates. Time to get more popcorn popped...<br><br>Ursachi, of course! As I've noted in previous posts, it took the US a huge amount of misplaced effort to drive Russia and China into each other's arms, since the two countries have very few interests in common and may causes for rivalry. Once the US is gone, no doubt things will heat up between the bear and the dragon -- just as things heated up between Russia and the US once Hitler was squashed.

Thanks for the blast (literally) from the past! <br><br>Anselmo, all those seem entirely reasonable suppositions. <br><br>Greg, my guess is that at the rate health care premiums are soaring, the penalty will always be cheaper than the cheapest health care plan. <br><br>Fabian, that's not a safe assumption. Satire directed at the other side's leadership is an ancient practice, and is as often aimed by fading powers at the leaders of rising ones as the other way around. <br><br>Valekeeperx, oh for crying out loud. I wove a reference to <i>Datura stramonium</i> into the name of the president in <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i> because the herb in question is a potent hallucinogen -- I know people who've taken it, for what that's worth -- and thus suggests something about President Weed's state of detachment from the hard realities of my fictional 2025. In the same way, Leonard Gurney got his name from his role vis-a-vis the body politic of the United States -- and no doubt you could find some reason, if you work at it, to insist that by calling him that I'm being disrespectful to undertakers.

Aiming for an arbitrary goal (or worse yet, as you point out, two or more contradictory goals) and leaving subordinates to figure out how to get there produces one kind of common failure these days, but another comes from those situations where the leadership figures want to be seen doing something about the crisis du jour, without concerning themselves with whether their actions have any results or not. <br><br>Lizardx, one of the things that I find most entrancing about all this is the way that the US politicians and media insist at the top of their lungs that they can't figure out what the Russians are up to, when the Russians have explained patiently over and over again exactly what they're doing and why.

As for the latest news about Islamic State, of course -- the al-Qaeda forces in the north of the country have had to pull troops away from their own eastern front in order to try to counter the Russian threat from the west, so IS has been able to advance against the weakened forces that remain.

So far the immediate area where they live hasn't been too disrupted to prevent them from living there (still has his home, his wife has work, food is still available...), but he says the situation can always change for the worse at short notice, and he worries about being stuck there.

These are usually the ones who went to prep schools and have never met anyone who ran out of money. They seem to view the lower classes like displays in dioramas, as if they are tourists in a world put there for their entertainment. I have seen them in a neighborhood bar where everyone is drinking $3 drafts, remarking to each other that ordinary people have real lives too, as if it were a revelation that working people have ideas and plans.

It appears that reality can be perceived by others than the arch druid, surprising place to find it.<br><br>"WILKERSON: ...since World War II and the acquisition of this enormous power by what in essence is the new Rome in the world, the United States, part of the shift that takes place in manipulating and managing that new power is a centralization of foreign policy away from the old cabinet places where it used to take place, most prominently through the Foreign Service and through the secretary of state, to the White House and to the creation of the 1947 National Security Act, the National Security Council. So if you ask me pro forma where does it exist today, it exists more in the National Security Council and its staff than it does anywhere else, certainly anywhere else in the cabinet. So what I'm saying is it's centralized in the White House.<br><br>But what does that mean in terms of, I think, your real question, who's behind the White House, and who's therefore behind U.S. foreign policy, more or less? I think the answer today is the oligarchs, which would be the same answer, incidentally, ironically, if you will, for Putin in Russia, the people who own the wealth, the people who therefore have the power and who more or less (and I'm not being too facetious here, I don't think) buy the president and thus buy American foreign policy. So that's as succinct an answer as I can give you and touch on a few historical points.<br><br>....<br><br>I think it's probably less fundamental and less precise, and therefore less in the interest, often, of the United States than you might think or that the American people might think. Because of what you've just suggested, that there are many poles in American foreign-policy, from the Congress to even the Supreme Court, to the White House, to the State Department, the Foreign Service, and so forth, it's a very complex mix, and it's rarely ever articulated in a way or manifests itself in a way that good leadership can control it, handle it, and manage it toward a real strategic objective. That's part of our problem in the world today.<br><br>But I would submit to you that certain oligarchs, anyway, big food, big pharmacy, big energy, oil, real estate, things like that, they like it this way because then they can flow into the void in the particular region or function or both that they want to control, that they want to manipulate, and do so effectively, whether it's subsidies from the federal government for oil companies or whether it's massive efforts by the government, clandestinely or otherwise, to influence someone like Monsanto being able to operate in Latin America and do the things that it does. So it's incredibly complex, difficult to analyze from a strictly governmental standpoint.<br><br>But when you start probing and you start analyzing, you begin to discover that there are centers in this mess, if you will, that are getting what they want. And what they want is basically wealth and power. And they then turn that wealth and power back into political contributions, which now almost have no limits, no constraints on them, and they influence people like John McCain and Lindsey Graham and Bob Menendez and Chuck Schumer and Barney Frank when he was in there and so influential with the banking committee, and they get what they want in terms of legislation that oftentimes I'm convinced the legislatures do not even realize they're doing. They don't understand that they're fulfilling this objective of a particular oligarch or conglomeration of oligarchs. And yet they're doing it, and they're doing it because they are well paid for doing it, in the sense that their PACs are flush and full and they get reelected."<br><br><a href=#c31659926077509396 title="comment permalink">10/10/15, 12:06 PM</a><br><br>

The 'metanet' is in fact a brand name of META Networks, originating as some kind of consolidation via takeover/merger of Facebook, Amazon and some other companies.<br>The Chinese also went down the route of encouraging devices with minimal local storage and processing, because their leadership wanted their equivalent of the metanet to be locked down to maintain control for similar reasons to the Atlantic Republic. <br>Perhaps having a 'metanet' connection is imperative because a large proportion of the Atlantian population do not have 'jobs' in the 20th century sense but are freelancers who get work via the metanet in the same way as day labourers in ancient Rome would be hired off the wall.<br>The cyberwarfare in the 2020s impressed to the Russian government that they should make their own relatively simple but durable electronics, less vulnerable to cyberattacks. Though this was initially focused around military needs, they did, along with a company based in present-day Germany (the area of Berlin where they are headquarted is known as Hackertopia), later market a range of computers with a performance roughly equivalent to turn of the century PCs to those parts of the world whose markets were not closed to them, such as Lakeland who had no real use for them except perhaps a handful of university departments, or Atlantic Rep. and China (and presumably Cascadia) where these products are banned as a threat to the "metanet" model, since these computers are designed to be useful even if an always-on net connection is not available, or is only low bandwidth.<br>Though the European effort to revitalise the infrastructure of the Internet as it faced decay and the damage of the cyberwar is mostly pragmatic, there are some who have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KdTvSRF_hA" rel=nofollow>grandiose schemes (not including building a 1000m mountain)</a> that are a source of tension.<br><br><a href=#c3041435913550304573 title="comment permalink">10/10/15, 3:22 PM</a><br><br>

They hang out in the art room with me at every possible break and lunch. They don't know it, but they've been clearly craving some boundaries. On the whole, our school is pretty good with that kind of discipline and backing up teachers and TA's in enforcing 'good manners', kindness and being sensible, (It's a British school, we don't have 'bullying', we have 'bad manners') :) The problem I'm seeing is in the fear of boredom or tedium in lessons or play. Just as I hear and read coming from US schools - it's a top-down problem, where the planners, (Principal, Head Masters, Deputies, etc. who are not in the classroom) want there to be non-stop engagement and fun. They are ALWAYS trying to find ways for the teachers to entertain or engage the kids more more MORE! Never shall there be a dull or pensive moment.<br>I suspect this is partly to justify their own jobs and partially a societal obsession/delusion about busy-ness and visible progress. They can't see the value in occasional boredom, tedium or down time. How they ever get through a good gym workout is beyond me!<br>My co-teacher and I just had an evaluation wherein the Headmaster came and sat in on a class. The Year 5's (10 to 11 year olds) were turning a flat 2-D Wassily Kandinsky painting into a 3-D abstract expressionist sculpture. From the questions the kids were asking and their total concentration and contentment in the boring task of cutting out their shapes from cardboard to build, I was thrilled. They got it! From their comments and questions, I could see their little brains were buzzing, planning, envisioning in their heads - a thing that has yet to exist; a thing that THEY will bring into existence. THAT'S what art class is about!! Yippy! <br>We got a terrible evaluation. The headmaster said, "They're not progressing, it's not exciting, they're just cutting paper". <br>Facepalm. Deep Breath. Maybe I need to give him a good talking to &amp; sit him down in one of our classes with scissors and cardboard! <br><br>On the Syria/Russia issue: Thank You, JGM and fellow commenters for great links and perspectives of this. I've learned a lot. Yesterday, Sat. was a good slow day- I spent too long surfing the web reading articles on this. I wanted to note that on every news blog or site with comments below the articles, be they left-leaning or right-leaning, almost every commenter seemed to see through the claptrap media narratives: 'West=good guys, Russia=Bad guy'. "OMG! Putin is lying! He's only trying to prop up his own dictator! He's only out for Russia and his own power! The Nerve of the guy!" A few commenters seemed to champion Putin, most did not - but they almost all saw the double standard and double-speak being foisted on them. It was so clear, it was an embarrassment to the 'journalists' still spinning this, "pay no attention to the man behind the curtain" obfuscation. <br>In more and more ways, People ARE waking up. At least they're trying to.<br><br><a href=#c7968658073551080283 title="comment permalink">10/10/15, 4:07 PM</a><br><br>

Are you suggesting that the industrial lens technology suite employs more people per capita, and gives them more interesting work than in the times of Venice eye-glass guilds, Huygens, van Leeuwenhoek, Hooke, Galilei, Newton and Spinoza? The first claim seems more likely than the second. Lens grinding for microscope, glasses and telescopes is pretty interesting work. Pushing buttons on a lens making machine is not. Nor is the factory work to make the lens making machine interesting, although its design was interesting, I bet, but so was the design of pre-industrial tools.<br><br><a href=#c2861962767527222162 title="comment permalink">10/10/15, 7:50 PM</a><br><br>

It does seem like a sitting duck.<br><br>Also, I'm not sure whether you read the drone article or not, but one of my favourite bits of silliness from it was the very serious mention of the: Drone economy. Seriously, what is with that? It certainly paints an emotive image, but it is a totally weird concept. I have noticed that they have pushed drone technology in the business section of the newspapers down here recently. Did I just hear someone say: Innovative new practice that will revolutionise the way we work and earn money?<br><br>The other thing about the article that blew my mind was that the drones were slated for use in North Dakota of all places and there is a whole lot to be read into that. My thinking was either the state police department had way too much excess funds as a result of the fracking bubble - or they expected some serious civil disturbances after that bubble popped and they anticipated that they may not be able to provide enough active staff for. There are probably other things to be read into that situation too. Maybe, the powers that be think that drones can be operated from a considerable and thus safe distance away from the situation thus replacing expensive boots on the ground with robots? Dunno.<br><br>Well, the soldiers of the Lakeland Republic could do a whole lot worse! Hehe! Too funny, I do hope that there is a mention of Sun Tzu, but as you've stated before you'll get to that all in good time. I'm enjoying the story as it is an excellent way to highlight differences in situations that people have otherwise been well programmed to ignore.<br><br>I look forward to the next instalment and just to confuse everyone, I enjoy the more gritty ADR essays too! ;-)!

One comment last week led me to think though, what will happen to Lakeland in the next generation? You wrote: "N Montesano, of course it's hard. That's one reason why I imagine people adopting it after a series of massive collective traumas -- living low-tier seems hard to us, but it would seem comfortable and, more important, secure to people who've spent several years living in refugee camps and then struggled through a long economic depression.".<br>Now, I have people in my familiy having led that kind of life, in the Soviet Union - my mother who emigrated to Austria by ways of marriage decades ago, and is still glad and thankful for not having to spin her own wool, make clothes, breed chickens, use hot water every few days, and harvest potatoes on the communal fields. A little pickling and baking and repairing one's clothes will do for her now as a hobby. My 88-year old grandmother who joined us a few years ago with her husband was expecting to find the land of milk and honey (she visited regularly before) and is now constantly grumpy because her chronical pain can't be helped even in the golden West. I'm trying to learn some of those things before they forget them, and other skills too, but they find it conspicuous. <br>All this to say that people can adopt a low-tier life and find it much better than the times of war, German labor camps, and Stalinist repression (like the land reform that took away their livestock), but after decades of peace and relative prosperity, might they not end up wanting "more", as they grow old and less able to do everything by hand? What will it take to make young people, who never saw worse times nor other countries by their own eyes, to understand the principles Lakeland was built on?<br><br><a href=#c1924086521004126475 title="comment permalink">10/11/15, 7:46 AM</a><br><br>

The other, a municipal park, still exists, but given the number of homeless addicts and active, ie untreated, mentally ill on the main street of the town, I wouldn't venture to the picnic grove.) Our doctor made house calls if we were likely contagious. Otherwise, we went to his office on the main floor of his home and checked in with his secretary/RN/wife and waited our turn. In an emergency, such as when my sister had a gash in her head, we went without an appointment and were rushed in ahead of everyone else. She was stitched and headed home in 20 min. The only "homeless" person I knew actually had a home in a shack at the town dump and was paid a small fee for managing it. He drove a horse and cart around town, collecting recyclables (rags and bones). He was well-respected,tho' fragrant, and we were taught to always greet him pleasantly. In our small town there were two shoe stores selling reasonably priced leather shoes, two ladies' dress shops, two men's shops, children's clothing, and a five and dime. We had no public transportation, everything was car-centric, but people didn't make a big deal out of walking a half mile or a mile either. So we don't need to go back to the people of a different era and mindset for a model of a different (not perfect) life.<br><br><a href=#c2549772993415343648 title="comment permalink">10/11/15, 5:50 PM</a><br><br>

I just paid a plumber a sum approximately equal to 1/3 of my annual heating bill to remove a clog from the drain that takes water from my washing machine. It was polyester fabric lint, which can apparently accumulate for years without biodegrading (unlike cotton, wool, or flax lint, or any of the other "organic" stuff that usually goes down the drain). So it turns out that polyester fleece (made from recycled PETE beverage containers, perhaps) keeps us warm when we turn down the thermostat, but there's a deferred cost in plumbing repairs. I wonder where else this plastic fiber lint is accumulating mischief?<br><br>I console myself with the thought that the plumber is a skilled local tradesman and a pleasant fellow to chat with as he advises me on repairs I can do for myself.<br><br><a href=#c6986412836228742740 title="comment permalink">10/13/15, 7:52 AM</a><br><br>

Beside earning the higher interest, astute (and lucky) players could make even more $ on the currency cross trade, and if the currency trades are done in a tax haven, no tax is paid on the deal!

It appears that a lot of the big multi-national players have adapted to zero inflation rates by performing all sorts of accounting trickery which they appear to be utilising to avoid paying company taxes. That's how I believe they are pretty much adapting to low interest rates and yet still growing their share of the pie.

Rare indeed!<br>If you are still trying to build a backstory about failed trade deals into Retropia, I have my own NAFTA perspective I feel like sharing. Toledo, Ohio happens to be my hometown. I was coming of age in the mid 1990's in Toledo when NAFTA's effects started really being felt. My first boyfriend lived with two male roommates and all three of them worked at a manufacturing company called Bunting Bearing. There were dozens, perhaps hundreds, of little manufacturing companies with jobs like those. A whole generation of men were growing up expecting the simple things that their fathers had, a decent high paying job with benefits good enough that they could settle down and even let the wife stay home and take care of the kids. Toledo was called The Glass City, and though Libby Glass was a very large employer the most coveted positions were at Jeep. They renamed the street from Willy Parkway to Jeep Parkway and everyone had some hometown pride.<br>Then Bunting Bearing left for Mexico, just like dozens of others, in a span of 2 to 3 years. A whole generation of men lost those good jobs, and replaced them by becoming truck drivers or night store clerks or something else that paid less in real terms and had no benefits. If you were a woman, either educated or remotely pretty, you left town for bigger things elsewhere. It got so bad one mayor campaigned and won on the slogan that he kept Jeep in Toledo. No comment when Jeep silently shuttered a few years later. Now I think the largest employer is Promedica, who has been buying up hospitals left and right. I guess that makes sense for an overweight, overmedicated, and downtrodden populace. But I do feel something is going to give, and is slowly for those that remain... <br><br><br><a href=#c2460791782343679861 title="comment permalink">10/17/15, 5:51 PM</a><br><br>
