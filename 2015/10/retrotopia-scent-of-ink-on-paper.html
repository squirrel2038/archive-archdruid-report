<div class=MsoNormal>
This is the sixth installment of an exploration of some of the possible futures discussed on this blog, using the toolkit of narrative fiction. Our narrator, roaming the streets of the capitol of the Lakeland Republic, visits a newsstand and a public library, and discovers that information and knowledge are two different things...</div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
***********</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I swung past my hotel, dropped off the shopping bag with my bioplastic clothes, and went back out onto Toledo’s streets. That makes it sound easier than it was; some kind of event—a wedding reception, I guessed from the decor—was getting started in one of the second floor ballrooms, and the lobby and the sidewalk outside were both crammed with people in formal wear heading in. It took some maneuvering to get through it all, but after not too many minutes I was strolling up an uncrowded sidewalk toward the unfinished white dome of the Capitol. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The Legislative Building back home in Philadelphia doesn’t have a dome. It’s an angular blob of glass and metal, designed by I forget which hotshot European architectural firm, and when it opened twenty-two years ago you could hardly access the metanet at all without being barraged by oohs and ahs about how exciting, innovative, and futuristic it was. You don’t hear much of that any more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They’ve spent twenty-two years now trying to get the roof to stop leaking and coming up with workarounds for all the innovative features that didn’t turn out to work too well, and the design looks embarrassingly dated these days, the way avant-garde architecture always does a couple of decades down the road. I was curious to see what the Lakeland Republic had done instead. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<a href=../../img/lakeland-flag-3c7d2e.png style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img border=0 height=133 src=../../img/lakeland-flag-b61202.png width=200></a>It took two blocks to get to a place where I had a clear view of the building, and when I did, I wasn’t in for any particular surprise. They’d modeled it on state capitol buildings in the old Union, with a tall white dome in the center above the rotunda and the big formal entrance, with a wing for each house of the legislature on either side. The Lakeland Republic flag—blue above and green below, with a circle of seven gold stars for the seven states that joined together at Partition—fluttered from a flagpole out front. Long rows of windows on each wing showed that there was plenty of room for offices and meeting rooms along with the legislative chambers. The walls were white marble with classical decor, and the peaked roofs to either side of the dome didn’t look as though they were likely to leak much. I thought about what the banker had said about history, and kept going. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Another block brought me to an open storefront with a big gaudy handpainted sign above it yelling KAUFER’S NEWS in big red letters. Down below were more newspapers and magazines—the kind that are printed on paper—than I’d ever seen in one place. I remembered what Melanie Berger had said about newspapers, and decided to check it out. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Inside, magazines lined the three walls and newspapers filled a big island unit in the middle. Signs with bright red lettering on the island unit gave me some guidance: one yelled TOLEDO PAPERS, another LR PAPERS, and a third FOREIGN PAPERS. That narrowed it down a bit, but there were still fifteen different newspapers in the Toledo section. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The proprietor was sitting on a tall stool next to the entrance. She was a scruffy-looking woman in her thirties with blonde hair spilling out from under a floppy cap, wearing an apron with KAUFER’S NEWS printed on it that had seen many better days. By the time I turned toward her, she’d already unfolded herself from the stool and came over. “Can I help you?” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Please,” I said. “I’m new in town and I don’t know the local papers.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“No problem.” She pointed to the stacked newspapers. “The <i>Blade</i>
and the <i>Journal</i> are the two dailies—the <i>Blade</i>’s the paper of record, the <i>Journal</i>’s the community paper and a lot more lively. The rest of ‘em are weeklies—neighborhood, ethnic, religious, what have you. The <i>Blade</i>’s a buck twenty-five, the <i>Journal</i>’s seventy-five cents, the others are twenty-five, except for the <i>Wholly Toledo</i>—that’s the arts and nightlife rag and doesn’t cost a thing.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s always amused me that everywhere in the former United States, the basic unit of the local currency is still called a buck—that’s true even in California, where what trade goes on around the edges of the civil war is mostly in Chinese currency when it isn’t just barter. I pulled out a couple of Lakeland bills, and got that day’s <i>Toledo Blade</i> and the latest <i>Wholly Toledo</i>. “Thanks,” I said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Sure thing.” She turned to another customer who had a magazine open. “You want to read that, Mac, you gotta buy it. This ain’t the library, you know.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The other guy looked sheepish, closed the magazine, paid for it and left the newsstand. “Speaking of which,” I said, “how do I get to the library from here?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Two blocks that way, hang a left, three blocks straight ahead and you’re there.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I thanked her again, tipped her one of the quarters she’d given me in change, and left. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The library wasn’t first on my list, though. The <i>Blade</i>
had a couple of articles on the front page I wanted to read. The wind was picking up, so the idea of plopping down on one of the park benches out in front of the Capitol didn’t particularly appeal; the question in my mind was where indoors I could sit down and read the thing. As it happened, I’d gone less than a block when I passed a little hole-in-the-wall caf<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"'>é</span>, and in the window seat was an old brown-skinned woman in a heavy wool coat with a cup of coffee in her hand and a copy of the <i>Journal</i> open in front of her. I took the hint, ducked inside, and a couple of minutes later was perched on a slightly rickety chair with a cup of coffee and the front page of the <i>Blade</i> to keep me company. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The lead article was on the political crisis that had blown up that morning. I’d guessed that the paper would have more details than you’d find in the 140-character stories you get from most metanet news sites, and I was right; for that matter, it had more detail than what you saw on the old internet, back in the day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I’d seen classified briefing papers on political issues that didn’t cover as much ground. By the time I’d finished the first paragraph I knew the basics—the group that was threatening to bolt out of Meeker’s coalition was the Social Alternative party, and the issue was whether lowering the tariff on three industrial metals counted as a government subsidy for technology—but the rest of the story, part of it on the front page and part of it back in the middle of the first section, filled in the details: who was backing the tariff reduction, who was opposing it, what the various arguments were, what the upper house of the legislature and the justices of the Constitutional Court had to say, and so on. By the time I’d finished reading it I had a pretty fair snapshot of the way politics worked in the Republic. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The other article that caught my eye was a follow-up piece on the destruction of the <i>Progresso IV</i> satellite a week before. That was news, and not just for spaceheads, since it was the first satellite to get taken out by orbital junk in a midrange orbit, and it was big enough that its fragments could turn into a real problem for other satellites in that range. The article quoted the head of the Brazilian space agency and an assortment of experts, with opinions ranging from sanguine to sobering. None of the facts were new to me—I’d been following the satellite situation since my first stint in government a dozen years back—but the story put it all into context effortlessly in a page and a half of newsprint, all the way from the first warnings back in the 1970s, through the slow motion Kessler-syndrome disaster that got going in low earth orbit in 2029, to the increasing pace of satellite failures in geosynchronous orbits in the last half dozen years. Since the 2030s, I knew, the midrange orbits had gotten pretty crowded; the last thing anybody needed was a Kessler syndrome there, too. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I got a refill of my coffee, flipped through the rest of the paper. The business section was going to take careful study, I saw that at a glance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Some of it was pretty straightforward—several counties issuing bonds, commodity prices in the Chicago exchange veering this way and that, and two full pages that looked like ordinary stock market data, except that I didn’t know any of the companies that were listed—but some of it was right out there in left field. The one that stuck in my mind was a corporation that was being wound up: not going bankrupt, being bought, or any of the other ways that corporations die back home, but winding up its affairs, distributing its remaining assets, and closing its doors. I shook my head, kept reading. The sports section seemed pretty much normal, except that I didn’t know any of the teams and there were a lot of them, enough that I wondered whether every middle-sized town in the Lakeland Republic had its very own. The arts and entertainment section in back had everything from concerts to theater listings to a page of radio programs. I nodded, slid the paper into one of the big outside patch pockets of my raincoat, paid my tab and headed out into the fading afternoon light. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The library was easy enough to find. It was a big two-story brick building with arched windows and a wide porch over the entrance, and a couple of cloth banners out front with CAPITOL BRANCH—TOLEDO PUBLIC LIBRARY on them. The lobby was spacious, with a bulletin board full of flyers. To the left, the door was propped open, and I heard a woman’s voice telling some kind of story about a mole and a water rat; a glance upward met the sign saying CHILDREN’S ROOM. I turned right, and went through the door into what I hoped was the adult section. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It didn’t take me long to figure out that I’d guessed right, even though it didn’t look like any library I’d ever seen. Instead of rows of long bare tables studded with keyboards and screens, it had shelves upon shelves upon shelves of printed books, more of them than I think I’d ever seen in one place before. Tables and chairs clustered in the middle of the room, with people sitting bent over books, and over toward the windows were a few sofas and overstuffed chairs with their own contingent of readers. Heavy carpet covered the floor and a historical mural covered the vaulted ceiling, spanning the distance from the native tribes on one end to a half-built Capitol on the other. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I really had no idea what to make of it all. In place of the clatter of keys and the babble of voices that gave the libraries I knew their soundtrack, the room was as hushed as a funeral parlor. I watched one of the patrons go up to the big desk where the librarians stood to ask a question, and the conversation that followed took place in murmurs. Lacking anything better to do, I crossed the room to the shelves of books. There was some kind of numerical code on the spines of the books, which didn’t tell me much of anything, but from the titles I figured out quickly enough that numbers in the low three hundreds, or at least these numbers, had to do with politics. I pulled out a couple of books, glanced at them, and was about to go to another shelf when I spotted a slim volume titled <i>Changing Tiers.</i> </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I pulled the book out, opened it, and found that it was exactly what I’d guessed, a guide for Lakelanders who were moving from one county to another at a different tier. I paged through it for a few minutes, decided that I needed to read it, and went looking for a free chair. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I realized pretty quickly that I’d found the book I needed, because it started out with a chapter on the history of the tier system, and that gave me the key to the whole arrangement. During the Second Civil War, the book explained, the states that became the Lakeland Republic got pounded most of the way back to the Stone Age by Federal airstrikes and two years of town-by-town fighting. When Washington finally fell and the fighting ended, nearly every bit of infrastructure in those states—roads, railways, power grids, water and sewer systems, you name it—was in ruins, and once Partition and the beginning of the debt crisis put paid to the last hope of a fast recovery, Lakelanders had to figure out how to rebuild and how to pay for it. The differences of opinion were drastic enough, and funds and other resources short enough, that the provisional government decided to make each county responsible for deciding what kind of infrastructure it wanted, and taxing itself to pay the costs. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
From that beginning, over a decade or so of contentious local decisions and gradual rebuilding, the tier system evolved. A second chapter sketched out the legal framework—certain clauses in the constitution and its amendments, two important decisions by the Constitutional Court, and the laws that regulated what counties could and couldn’t do, and what they could and couldn’t enforce. It was all very clear, and I got out my notebook and filled most of four pages with notes. More to the point, I ended up with some sense of the logic of the tier system and the reasons why it made sense to Lakelanders. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By the time I’d finished those two chapters the last daylight was gone and the window in front of me looked out on a night scene lit by streetlamps and occasional windows. I decided not to read the rest of the book, put it back in its place on the shelves, and headed out into the cold wind. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I don’t get lost easily, or I’d probably have ended up wandering off in some random direction until I could find a cab or something. As it was, I wasn’t sure of my bearings until I got within sight of the Capitol. The sidewalks were anything but deserted—I gathered that Toledo had a lively nightlife scene—but I didn’t pay a lot of attention to the people I passed just then. I was thinking about the book I’d read and the newspaper in my pocket, and the difference between the fragmentary bits of information I was used to getting off short squibs on the metanet and the knowledge-in-context I’d gathered from the longer, more context-rich pieces I’d just taken in. It was a sobering comparison. I decided I’d have to check out Lakeland schools and colleges, and see if the difference applied there as well. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
When I got to the hotel where I was staying, though, I had to pay attention, because there was no way in; the crowd from the wedding reception was out in front, lining a narrow path from the door to the edge of the sidewalk, where an ornate horsedrawn carriage waited. I didn’t have too much trouble figuring out what was about to happen, so I stood there on the outer edge of the crowd, waiting for the happy couple. Some of the guests had taken the time to put on coats and hats before heading out into the night air, and I blended in well enough that a young woman pushing her way through the crowd handed me a little bag of rice to throw. I took it, amused, and waited with the rest. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A few minutes later, the guests of honor came out—two<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>young men in their early twenties, laughing and holding hands and obviously very much in love. I pelted them with rice along with everyone else, and stood there while they climbed into the carriage and waved. The driver snapped his reins and the horses broke into a smart trot; the usual cheering and waving followed, and away they went. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The crowd began to scatter. I turned toward the door and found myself facing the pianist who’d been playing in the hotel restaurant during lunch that same day. Of course he didn’t know me from George Washington’s off ox; he turned to go back inside, and since that was the way I was headed, too, I followed him. The lobby wasn’t too bad, but the stair was a river of people headed for the doors, and so the pianist and I ended up standing next to each other at the foot of the stair, waiting for the crowd to pass by and let us through. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That was pretty good jazz you were playing,” I said to him, “here at lunchtime.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He gave me a startled look. “Thank you!” Then: “You’re one of Sandy’s political friends?” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“No, just staying here at the hotel.” He nodded, and I went on. “You play anywhere else?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Yeah, this is just my day gig. Friday and Saturday nights I’m at the Harbor Club downtown.” He reached into his jacket, pulled out a little rectangle of stiff paper and handed it to me. I realized after a blank moment that it was an old-fashioned business card. Fancy script spelled out: </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div align=center class=MsoNormal style="text-align: center">
<b>Sam Capoferro</b></div>
<div align=center class=MsoNormal style="text-align: center">
<b>and his Frogtown Five</b></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Down below in little print was contact info. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Show that at the door and there’s no cover charge,” he told me. “See you there sometime.” </div>
<br>
A gap opened up in the crowd, and he headed up the stair. I pocketed the business card and waited for another opening. </div>

I may have mentioned to you before that in choosing to base the house design here on a 19th century Victorian farm house I created a monster architectural faux pas. Pah! The federal parliament house was constructed only a few short decades back and I recall at the time, the politicians wanted to install a nuclear bomb and fall out shelter and the population in general absolutely cracked it with them and forced them to understand the populations general concern in that what is good for the goose is good for the gander (as they say).<br><br>Wholly Toledo sounds very amusing to my ears and I'm sure there is a joke in there somewhere (something possibly from the very dodgy Batman television series from the late 60's to early 70's is ringing a mental bell) but I'm not culturally attuned to understand the joke. <br><br>Oh my, the article contains the full argument, alternative opinions, names were named, motivations analysed and blurted out loud for all the world to read - what is the world going to? ;-)! hehe! I'll bet you enjoyed writing that bit!<br><br>Yes, well I'd be in favour of winding up companies that behaved badly - fines are no impediment to the wealthy. I read of more such abuses with each passing week and it appears to me that if anything corporate corruption is on the increase as real wealth declines. A big mess is brewing over in the tax office down here as it appears that the very largest accounting firms have taken it upon themselves to undertake the reviews of their own clients affairs on behalf of the tax office which is possibly a very generous offer - pah! what does conflict of interest really mean anyway? It isn't a good look and surely they can't think that it could possibly ever be dressed up nicely?<br><br>The story was very enjoyable I just wanted to say thanks for taking the time to write it. I'm pretty certain that you are enjoying yourself too as I read your amusement in between the words.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br>PS: I've got a new blog entry up: <a href=http://ferngladefarm.blogspot.com.au/2015/10/strange-days-indeed.html rel=nofollow>Strange days indeed </a>, discussing the recent large out of control bushfire in the area and the forests down here in general.

Right now, I'd be happy just to have it survive the current crisis in print journalism which has been causing papers to downsize, merge, and fold.

The winding up of the corporation -- stay tuned; I've had quite a bit of fun chasing down details of the way corporations originally functioned, before they metastasized into the economic carcinomas they are today, and the Lakeland Republic has taken a stroll down memory lane in that respect as well. In general, this is turning into a fun project -- I'm glad to hear that's coming across. <br><br>Pinku-sensei, I'm pretty sure the <i>Blade</i> suspended publication during the war years, but got things going again afterwards. According to Wikipedia, Toledo currently has one daily and seven weeklies, so it didn't seem improbable to me that in a town with no television and no internet/"metanet", two dailies and fifteen weeklies would be a likely number. As for the Kessler syndrome, yes, that's why I mentioned it in the story. We'll be hearing more about the <i>Progresso IV</i> and the Kessler syndrome as the tale unfolds. <br><br>Mark, the Second Civil War was rather more complex than that, but one of the main things that made it happen was a Federal government that consistently put the interests of a handful of big corporate interests over the interests of everyone else. There'll be more about that as we proceed. <br><br>HalFiore, there's a law in the Lakeland Republic that coins have to be worth more in face value than when they're melted down.

That's one of the reasons that the decline and fall of industrial civilization is guaranteed: any society that tries to support itself indefinitely on nonrenewable resources is going to run out of <i>all</i> those resources. It's just a matter of which shortage strikes hardest first. <br><br>PatriciaT, the marble was salvaged from the old capitol buildings of the seven states that combined to form the Lakeland Republic. The rice is grown all over the southern third or so of the Republic -- due to climate change, paddy rice does very well there in 2065. The coffee, as mentioned in an earlier post, is an expensive foreign import, usually cut with chicory; during the embargo it was smuggled in through the Free City of Chicago, while these days it comes up the St. Laurence Seaway from points overseas and is offloaded at ports along the southern shore of the Great Lakes. Next question? ;-)<br><br>Peakfuture, thank you! I didn't give the RBG values because I don't speak that language -- the colors you've chosen make a nice balance with the gold of the stars, so I'm hereby exercising authorial privilege and making them the correct colors. (People in the Lakeland Republic, by the way, treat their flag the way that most European countries treat theirs, i.e., with respect as a symbol of the nation, but without the totemistic passion that surrounds the current US flag; there is no Lakeland Pledge of Allegiance. The national anthem is called "Silver Waters" -- that's not its official name, but it's the first two words, and nobody but librarians remembers the official name any more.) As for the contrast between the capitols, trust me, I loathe architectural modernism at least as much as Jim does. <br><br>Niklinna, glad to hear that I've achieved that level of verisimilitude!<br><br>Jonathan, we discussed that in detail in the comments page a couple of weeks back. People who live in one county and make use of the resources of another get to pay user fees to cover their share of the costs. As for transportation, railroads are privately owned, not public utilities, so not subject to the tier system; then there's the canal system, which is a tier 1 technology and thus viable wherever a good route can be found.

As for money, by the end of the Second Civil War the US dollar was worthless and most exchanges in what was about to become the Lakeland Republic used either barter or Canadian currency; after Partition, the provisional government started issuing its own currency to pay its employees and its bills, and since it wasn't being thrown around with wild abandon(cough cough, quantitative easing, cough cough), people took to it. <br><br>Pg, yes, but carpet makes for a quieter and more pleasant space.

Nowadays' corporations act as symbolic mechanisms of power the way ruling political parties used to in Communist regimes. That may also be why religious fanaticism, and its current warband offshoots, are so hard for the West to fight, because it is a mechanism of power which it is not used to subdue.<br>I was attending one of their (free to attend) conferences in our beautiful capital city, and it struck me : what i enjoyed the most there was definitely the "retro" things. The conference was set in a very trendy place, which used to be riverside docks. And what was so amazing during the event was the quality of the catering...<br><br>All of this paid for by one single corporation's ownership of millions of individuals' personal data. I felt increasingly uneasy during the mostly technical talks, because aside the boredom at the usual technomagic (again, to the tune of lyrical rock music...), I could not see how the new Cloud technology would create new jobs. Which is all the more critical as the rich industrial nations' economy is currently stuck to a standstill. That is exactly how a Medieval court must have worked : the powerful nobles du jour giving away magnificent dinners for free to people who felt like they were being granted a favor... while deep inside themselves they knew that the social roles were also stuck to a standstill, and the favors granted them were actually a manifestation of that rigid social order. Ultimately, we are just circling around the same patterns, and the more effort is given to ornate those patterns, the more unpleasant it will turn out for the commoners.<br><br>I could easily picture a hyped media figure made famous for her/his rebuttal of the mythology of Progress, comfronted with one of the defenders of techno-hype, calmly performing counterspells under the glare of TV cameras : just asking the hard questions, "what social role, responsibilities, possibilities, or life perspective does this exciting new piece of technology provide you with ?" "if you had to be deprived of all that for just one day, and started reflecting on your life, what insights would you derive from having perused that piece of technology ?"... and so on.<br><br>More generally, it was occurring to me how the war for Progress has already started inside us and not just around the middle-East region. Like any war, it features several battles : the inner battle of belief, which Progress has already lost as far as this audience is concerned, and the inner battle for concrete effort. Because it is quite one thing to believe that History does not go in any particular direction, and quite another to peel vegetables by hand when you could just buy your salad from a supermarket bag. Which of the two alternatives is cheaper ? Which is more satisfying ? I suspect these battles are also being fought in Mr Carr's own psyche as the story unfolds... identifying, and figuring out meaningful responses to, those inner conflicts is what gives the narrative a lot of its tension.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-scent-of-ink-on-paper.html#c7819199960902678825 title="comment permalink">10/15/15, 1:51 AM</a><br><br>

I guess that's a relic of the time when Czechoslovakia was a Warsaw Pact country and all imports were very expensive, when they were available. Coffee was a luxury. The Czechs were used to pay a lot for that rare pleasure, a cup of coffee. Several decades later, Czech restaurant owners still see no reason to make coffee cheaper than it used to be, even though the country is now part of the EU (In Prague, I saw Subway restaurants, McDonalds, and all the Western brands you can think of). Coffee is expensive but beer is cheap, and the Czech drink lots of it, even teenagers.<br><br>Tea is as expensive as coffee. In an old town Prague restaurant I had a very good menu for 109 crowns (a mug of beer, a plate of meat and legumes, and a piece of excellent local cake), but the cup of tea which I drank afterwards cost me 40 crowns. Still very cheap by French standards, though: 149 crowns = 5.42 euros, or approximately 7 US dollars. Tip not included.

Many had labour sections written for the majority of people who work for a paycheque, and not just a business section for investors. Some ran synopses of the Sunday sermons of their area’s most prominent religious leaders – important not just for piety, but for politics, as the local preachers and bishops had enormous influence. Many came out twice a day, so people could read the news more often than most of us check web sites now.<br><br>Our modern culture tells us that we have more information today than anyone in history, because of the internet – but that assumes that information existing somewhere is the same as knowledge being disseminated. Few web sites will cover the library board meeting or the public works department, and if they do they are likely to be a blog by a single unpaid individual. Usually no editors would exist to review the material for quality or readability, and the writer would be under no social, financial or legal pressure to be accurate or professional, or to publish consistently, or to pass on their duties to another once they resign. <br>Transcripts of church sermons are even harder to find, so some of the most important shapers of public opinion go unknown by anyone outside their circles.<br> <br>I’ve worked on a number of issues with community activists in the USA, some left-wing and some right-wing, but no one wanted to associate with a church unless they belonged to one, and then only with their own. When I suggested to one auditorium of activists (left-wing, in this case) that they go to various churches and learn about them, I was actually shouted down; animal sacrifice, I think, would have earned less outrage. <br><br>Of course, as people readily point out to me, you can surf the internet and do your own research, but you must work diligently to winnow the accurate material from the dubious claims – anyone can create a web site that says anything. Moreover, most people are not going to do all that trouble themselves – we have lives, after all – and you shouldn’t have to. That’s what journalists were for. <br><br>When I talk about newspapers this way, people often respond that we no longer destroy forests. Of course some people used to harvest trees for newspaper and not replant them, but it doesn’t have to be that way – you could plant willow and get ten tonnes of wood to the hectare per year in this climate, and never fell another ancient forest of giant trees. Contrast that with the mountains of coal we have to burn to feed server farms, the rare-earth-metal mining, the semiconductor factories and the global shipping that we need to employ just to create a short-lived computer, all to do most of what we did with a piece of paper. <br><br>Once a newspaper was read, moreover, it had only begun its useful life – then it would be used to wrap gifts or groceries, then to line insulation or chicken coops, then as tinder for the fire, and the resulting ashes could then make soap or fertiliser. Once an electronic device has a single minor problem, however, it tends to go into a dump, with all its heavy metals and plastics, perhaps to contaminate the soil for thousands of years to come. <br><br>Computers are useful for some things, of course – I’m writing this on one, and you’re all reading this on another one --- but we have used their monster footprint to substitute for everything. <br><br>Look forward to next week,<br><br>Brian Kaller<br>County Kildare, Ireland<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-scent-of-ink-on-paper.html#c8768857995326018308 title="comment permalink">10/15/15, 5:37 AM</a><br><br>

We've been enjoying your words for years but reading about what could be in a fictionalized from definitely brings issues closer to home, makes them feel more real and plausible.<br><br>Two things. One, here in Maine this summer I was part of a rice-growing trial. I successfully grew rice in 5 gallon buckets. Some large-scale permaculture farmers here are trying to develop commercial rice growing, with Northern Japanese and Siberian varieties. Farmers in Vermont are also growing rice.<br><br>Secondly, here's an idea for a future short story contest: people can write, let's say, a day in the life piece about someone in their current profession. You can set the parameters (time, climate and resource conditions, etc...). If the profession won't exist, imagine the life of someone with your current skillset. Even without a story contest though, I think it's a great mental exercise for all of us to imagine how our work would be done in the future under different circumstances. As a baker, I've begun to ponder, how would my bakery be in each of the different tiers? <br><br>My husband and I are Gen Xers who have always been drawn to lower-tech ways of doing things.

He grew up in a small town in rural Pennsylvania. Technically, I grew up in the same small town, 40 years later-- at least, it had the same name and the same location, but there the similarities end. <br><br>I was going to describe it, but I think that readers here might appreciate a (slightly edited) quote:<br><br>****<br><br>"What did we have in our community of about 3,500 souls? Just downtown we had:<br><br>"Two supermarkets; two other complete grocery stores; Schultz’s meat market; four barber shops; Prave’s Beauty Salon; two banks; the [Name of Town] Building &amp; Loan; two jewelry stores; three women’s clothing stores; two men’s clothing stores; five restaurants; three hotels; two hardware stores; the American Legion and Moose clubs; the public library; four car dealers; seven garages/full service gas stations; a taxi; The News Stand; Western Union; two drug stores, both with soda fountains and booths; four dentists; five doctors; the music store; The Flower Shop; Wolf Furniture Store with four floors of merchandise; two shoe repair shops; The Hi-Way Diner; an eight lane bowling alley; Hoke’s Appliance Store; the local newspaper and print shop; the feed store; a five and dime; many law offices; a bakery; <br>The Knights of Columbus Hall, with substantial meeting rooms and the Boy Scout hall in the basement; The Y; The lodge headquarters for the Masonic chapter; State Liquor store; Pennsylvania Electric Company offices; Bell Telephone Company offices; Ed Black Radio and TV; Mulvehill’s Electric; The Rivoli Movie Theater; the fire hall; Borough Offices; H. Justus Apel Plumbing and Heating; a coffee shop; The County Jail; and of course, the park.<br><br>"Beyond the downtown in other parts of the immediate community were the hotels, a beer distributorship; A Tinker’s Shop, where everything and anything could be repaired; a convenience store; several neighborhood stores; two complete lumber companies, each with a railroad siding; three funeral homes; the public elementary and high schools and the Catholic schools; the football field and three playgrounds. <br><br>"Then there were the fairgrounds, well over a hundred acres at the edge of town and home to Cicero’s Roller Skating Arena.<br><br>"All in all, it made for a very busy town.<br><br>"Parking was never an issue since everyone who lived in the community walked."<br><br><a href=retrotopia-scent-of-ink-on-paper.html#c6003470468028125241 title="comment permalink">10/15/15, 10:18 AM</a><br><br>

He goes on to describe a world that sounds impossible today. People participated in community organizations and ran business from their homes. Cats, dogs, and children were all allowed outside unsupervised. Most surprising of all is his insistence that it was a "much less pretentious time than today:"<br><br>"The age and size and style of the house didn’t matter. What mattered were the people who lived within. Dan McAlaster’s family cooked over a coal fired stove. So did the family of the girl I took to the prom. No one considered Glenn or her any less than anyone else. Danfather was a barber. Heck, Jimmy O'Reilly was a barber and he was one of the best loved persons in town. Charlie Merchel was a barber and was one of the founders of the Democratic Party in the county."<br><br>I exaggerated a little bit. Some of this still existed when I was growing up. Of the five clothing stores described above, one was left; I remember when it closed, and it occurs to me now that that was not long after the Walmart opened up. The fairgrounds he described were still accessible, and near the house I grew up in. When I was young we could still take our sleds there in the wintertime. Now whoever manages them keeps them surrounded by barbed wire-- and who can blame them, since the county fair is primarily a place for teenagers to buy drugs and get into fistfights? <br><br>Most of my family has left Pennsylvania, myself included. My mother was back recently. She told me, "You would not recognize it. It's not the town you grew up in." And the town I grew up in in the 90s had already fallen so far from the world my grandfather knew in the 40s. And-- this is the worst part-- it is by far the most prosperous of all the small towns in the county. <br><br>I guess that's why this piece affects me so strongly. Instead of being simply a pie in the sky fantasy, it points the way back to a world that we really did have, and that we lost-- or had taken from us.

Its major problem, from the viewpoint of the public library system, was insufficient space for computers, even after removing quite a few books. The system got a bond issue on the ballot and passed (I voted against it) to fund new and remodeled buildings for it and a few other branches. I could have gone to the new branch yesterday but chose not to. I'm sure I will not be pleased.

I seem to be in a minority of one, but I have to say that I am struggling with these Retrotopia posts. It's difficult to pin down exactly what it is, but I'll have a go. Please think of the following as constructive criticism!<br><br>In the first place, as also picked up by Joe above, the Lakelanders behave like the Cunninghams but without so much as the Fonz to worry about. Is life in the LR really so idyllic?<br><br>This leads me to the second point, which is harder to define, but which is linked to just how much 2015 America is left in the LR. In particular, there seems still to be such a heavy focus on money. The performance of the different tiers seems to be measured in monetary terms even though that surely isn't the point of the experiment. It starts with the tipping of bellhops, waiters etc. So people aren't nice to you or don't just help you because they like you, or take pride in doing their job to the best of their ability, they do it in the hope of scoring a fat tip. This undermines real social contact.<br><br>When Carr flipped the newsagent a quarter for her chat, it really made my flesh crawl and I had to stop reading!<br><br>In case you didn't know it, this is a major difference between Europe and the US. In mainland Europe, after a meal in a restaurant you just leave some small change on the table, not a percentage of the bill. This is because the service is already included in the bill. Leaving a big tip won't guarantee you good service next time anyway, because on the one hand, all tips go into a big jar to be divvied up between all the personnel including the cooks and bottle washers at the end of the week, and on the other, because European waiters and waitresses hate it if some big wad puts down a load of cash expecting everyone to come running next time. "Like you own me now?" <br><br>So the tier system in the LR seems to be predicated on which tier makes the most economical sense whereas it would surely be better to look at other measures such as which county feels the most comfortable, all things considered, or where you have the highest level of culture, or even where you get the best food. <br><br>The point is that different value systems do exist. I know, because I grew up in the England of the 1960s and 70s. Back then, most people had a station in life, be that butcher or lawyer, cleaner or teacher, and accepted it. Most people didn't even entertain ideas "above their station." They also didn't have more than fanciful ideas about 'getting rich quick'. Instead, many (most?) drew pleasure from doing their jobs and doing them well. Yes, of course, there was plenty wrong in those days, too, but I can't help thinking that in getting the entire population to embrace hard-core capitalism - as started in the 1980s in the UK - the country was severely impoverished in another way.<br><br>I shall continue to follow Carr's adventures as I'm interested to know how Lakeland functions, but sometimes my teeth will be gritted!<br><br><a href=retrotopia-scent-of-ink-on-paper.html#c531579244203752844 title="comment permalink">10/15/15, 11:03 AM</a><br><br>

The title is probably a tribute to Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles, if you can recollect the end of that it makes perfect sense.)<br>It's an excellent book, for what it is, which is your classic Man versus Nature, in this case the rather inhospitable Nature of Mars, and deals very well with the sharp and hard limits of resources available.

And those broadcasts can often be listened to while working, when the nature of the task permits. Other sports can and would also be broadcast of course, but most have a bigger difference in impact between a radio broadcast and what you can see and hear from the stands, and require more concentration to follow.<br><br>Speaking of radio, radio drama might eventually accumulate a longer history and larger body of work in Lakeland than it did in the 20th century U.S. That could get creatively very interesting.<br><br>I agree with Joe Roberts about the 1940s vibe.

Dividing a circle into seven parts can't be done precisely by any strictly Euclidean method, but you can always divide 360 by 7 and plop a protractor in the center of your circle. Yes, students in Lakeland high schools learn how to do these things!<br><br>Thomas, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_Earth_orbit rel=nofollow>think again</a>. <br><br>Leo, I based it on the Pike Place Market newsstand in Seattle, but there used to be plenty like it. <br><br>MigrantWorker, back in the 1960s, the same Southern states where some people are currently pitching a fit about same-sex marriage were pitching a fit about the abolition of laws that forbade interracial marriage. There were the same claims about how letting (insert labels here) marry would destroy the fabric of society, blah blah blah, and it all dried up and blew away when it turned out that, after all, the only people who are actually affected by an expansion of the right to marry are the individuals who exercise that right. <br><br>Donalfagan, I'm quite sure that by 2065, flat roofs are as extinct as brontosaurs in the Lakeland Republic, or anywhere else in the former US that gets significant amounts of rain. <br><br>Brian, exactly. For all the babble about "the information economy," people in today's America are far less well informed than people in most other countries, and let's not even talk about people in the pre-Internet era. <br><br>Unknown Ellen, you're welcome and thank you!

I travel way, WAY too much doing IT process consulting and organizational change management: I'd move to the Lakeland Republic in a heartbeat.<br><br>The Project Manager in me feels that Lakeland's success is due wholly to proper planning. In this week's segment you give us a whiff of the process in the opening chapter of "Changing Tiers". I, too, want to read that book. Back in my real world these days, it seems like nobody thinks strategically. The best we can muster is some semi-gluteal tactical planning. The most basic view of how we're going to do it, but we never describe what the "it" is, the strategy part. Forced by economic reality, the Lakelanders HAD to describe the desired future state (the various tiers) as well as how to get there. Collective we have forgotten how to define the desired end state, how to measure success or failure of reaching that state and how to maintain and sustain that state once reached. Simple scarcity taught the Lakelanders all about resource management.<br><br>I would guess that our visitor's homeland knows none of this type of shared discipline. Those at the bottom are well aware of scarcity but not those at the top. For them, planning involves no end states but rather they see themselves as stocking the lakes with opportunities for a fish dinner. Planning goes no further than setting the stage for their friends to exploit the projects for their own gain and success. It is all about teeing up for success. (Gawd I hate that phrase.)<br><br>Planning with out its object being that all-important end state is all folly. The Treaty of Versailles ending the Great War planned only to extract retribution on Germany and look at what that yielded. The Allies deliberately and EXPENSIVELY planned for the re-integration of Germany and Japan into the post-war world, and look at what that yielded. Our own War in Iraq is a more recent object lesson in the dangers on poor (or no) end-state planning. <br><br>As a ode to poor planning, I want to print up bumper stickers and t-shirts with my brainchild, "There's nothing more permanent than a temporary solution."<br><br>I certainly hope you plan on sharing some of the mechanical details as to the relative success of Lakeland as well as their inevitable failures. I love nothing moire than a good Lessons Learn session. <br><br>Thanks again for all the wonderful reads.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-scent-of-ink-on-paper.html#c1850697672044365417 title="comment permalink">10/15/15, 6:08 PM</a><br><br>

Until the Treaty of Richmond in 2062, there was a fairly tight embargo on all Lakeland products, and books weren't a major article of smuggling -- literacy rates in the Atlantic Republic aren't that good, and the metanet distracts a lot of people. As of the time of this story, there's a trickle of Lakeland books in Atlantic bookstores -- and some other things going on which will be covered later on. <br><br>Aias, thank you! The colors on the flag were Peakfuture's choosing rather than mine, but they look very good. I did consider <i>Ordem</i> as a name, but the irony of the other -- especially as things unfold -- was too tempting to pass up. <br><br>Zentao, we'll be getting into the downsides of excessively complex military technology as things proceed. The short form is that the more complex any technological structure becomes, the more vulnerabilities to monkeywrenching it has, and military actions that target those vulnerabilities become effective shortcuts to total victory on the part of the opponent. <br><br>Theotokosbooks, I wondered who was going to fall into that trap first. No, a decision to adopt older technologies doesn't require adopting the prejudices that happened to be in place the last time that technology was in use. If it did, you'd also have to insist that I shouldn't have had an African-American man in a position of responsibility in a bank patronized by white folks, since that wasn't done in 1940s America either. The argument you've attempted to use here is very common in contemporary American discourse -- it's standard to insist that "the past" is a unity from which nothing can be brought back without bringing back everything else -- but that's nonsense, and the fact that you've cherrypicked one social habit from the 1940s (prejudice against same-sex couples) while tacitly ignoring another (prejudice against African-Americans) shows that it's nonsense. <br><br>As for the Second Religiosity, we'll be getting to that, though the main thrust of it is further in the future. <br><br>Eric, not a problem. Enjoy the event!<br><br>Toomas, I don't think you'll see many Lakeland Republic flags in that condition; it's a new country, after all, with plenty of people still alive who fought and suffered to bring it into being, and even more who fought to defend it against the invasion mentioned earlier. Still, there's respect and then there's fetishism. <br><br>Steve, and of course that's exactly the point -- this is a real option. Nothing prevents Americans from building such communities again, given a willingness to make some hard choices and stick with them. <br><br>Daelach, I'm quite sure that the Lakeland coast guard (which also functions as a navy on the Great Lakes) teaches navigation by sextant!<br><br>Pygmycory, remember that Carr isn't a member of the lower classes! He's quite used to weddings. <br><br>SLClaire, probably fewer books. I sometimes wonder if it's going to be necessary to borrow a leaf from Ben Franklin and found some private lending libraries that will fill the niche public libraries are abandoning -- that is to say, places that have lots of books to read. <br><br>Hereward, understood -- but in the US, tipping is an ordinary part of life, and the Lakeland Republic is set in part of what used to be the US. I have to deal with British characters eating Marmite, so you'll have to deal with American characters tipping... ;-)<br><br><a href=retrotopia-scent-of-ink-on-paper.html#c905487699979247212 title="comment permalink">10/15/15, 6:34 PM</a><br><br>

There are other clubs with other kinds of music, of course -- as Carr noted, there's quite a lively nightlife scene in Toledo, and in most other large towns in the Republic. <br><br>Redoak, well, it basically got fed through a space cuisinart...<br><br>Jason, I wonder if old journalism textbooks might be worth finding and putting back into circulation. When I took journalism classes in high school back in the late 1970s, the textbooks (which were far from new) put a lot of work into explaining how to write clear, balanced, responsible stories in that odd but useful newspaper style, where everything you have to know is in the first paragraph, and the further down you go the more fine detail you get. <br><br>August, heh heh heh. I'd like to be able to tune into a Lakeland station or two myself -- between the live music broadcasts, the news programs, and the radio drama, it's worth listening to. <br><br>Rita, yes, and it succeeded in breaking the machines -- usually by handing over power to local business interests. Oh well. <br><br>1ab, thanks for this. The comments are a hoot -- an article like that is guaranteed to bring out the irrational rationalists in force. <br><br>Myriad, ha!

That'll become clearer as we proceed. <br><br>KevPilot, you're welcome and thank you. One of the things that enables the bad planning we see around us these days is that there are basically no penalties for failure.

This is prompted "because of rising concerns that computers used to chart courses could be hacked or malfunction." <br>Also, I might add that computers tend to make people stupid and that navigation is both an art and skill. There are plenty of examples of yachties running their boats onto reefs (even in broad daylight) because they relied on GPS data for their position. Ultimately, a GPS "position" only tells you latitude and longitude which then have to be plotted, either by hand on a paper chart or electronically on a screen. The problem is that the charts themselves may be inaccurate. I've personally encountered islands as much as 4 miles off their charted position. <br>Visual look out, being able to tell the presence of reef/islands from the way waves are bent around them and the color of the water, knowing which birds hunt at sea, but sleep on land, etc, are all skills that work even when all the batteries die!<br>URL of article: http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=11529836<br><br><a href=retrotopia-scent-of-ink-on-paper.html#c866312403615801271 title="comment permalink">10/15/15, 9:44 PM</a><br><br>

It retains all the original FLW seating, cushions, bedding etc., and not wanting to waste the opportunity, I tried it all out. Almost every bit of it was awkward and uncomfortable.

It so happens there IS a large, independent, member-run sports association that would be right at home in the Lakeland Republic without changing a thing. It is organised geographically by parish and by county,throughout the whole island of Ireland, borders notwithstanding. At every level member elected committees run things, sorting out sports meets, fundraising, etc. Every parish hosts dozens of teams from the children's mixed teams to the teenage and adult women's and men's teams, with the best players feeding into the county level teams. The ethic is amateur sportsmanship and the revival &amp; preservation of Gaelic games. It is wildly successful at cultivating local participation and has built pitches, stadiums (stadia?) and sports facilities entirely from member raised fundraising and ticket sales since its founding.

I have never felt guilty about reading your blog knowing that I have bought nearly all your books! Nevertheless, I understand that the way things are set up in the publishing business, precious little of the retail price of any book ever gets back to the creative soul who wrote the bloomin' thing. Moreover, it's a one-off for each person who buys each book - few people come back and buy a second copy - the royalty cheque comes in and then you need to sell more books, mainly by writing some new ones for, let's be honest, quite a niche market. It's clear that you put an enormous amount of time and effort into writing this blog each week (for which I am very grateful) and any tips into the Archdruid's hat are, therefore, obviously very welcome. <br><br>So, mainly to assuage my guilt and partly to make a point, I have slipped you a bung (as they say in the land of the Marmite-munchers) via said hat.

No, what I was trying to say is that throwing money at anyone who says something nice to you results in obsequiousness and fawning behaviour. You often point us in the direction of the French Revolution as a guide to how a seemingly robust civilization can quickly descend into violence and chaos. If I think of the epitome of obsequiousness and fawning behaviour then I think of the royal court of Ancien Régime France.

Taxi-drivers and hotel porters (and you never gave them a 'tip', you said 'get yourself a drink'... ;-)) As a youth, I'd have missed buying bar-staff a drink, of course. About the only other example I can recall from my childhood was leaving a 'little something' out for the dustbin men just before Christmas, because it was such a cruddy job and done in all weathers. Occasionally, you might leave the change behind at a cafe or similar, if the staff had been exceptionally nice or over-worked. But the pertinant word here is 'gratuity', from the Latin 'gratis', implying 'freely given' - NOT an expectation or obligation as it appears to be in the USA. I feel the American practice is exploitative of both staff and customers. I personally expect the business to pay the staff properly, and to advertise to me an honest price for their wares, and not expect me to pay extra to cover their own penny-pinching. Needless to say, I committed a major faux-pas the first time I ate in the USA, and the graceless way in which it was pointed out led to me saying: "You want a tip? Unionise - that's the best tip you'll get today."<br><br>Flag-fetishism, though, really makes my skin crawl. I find it very ugly, largely because those who are most prone to going bug-eyed and frothy-mouthed about it are exactly the same ones who insist that burning the Quran is 'freedom of speech'.<br><br>As for architecture - well, if it doesn't work as a building, they should give up the pretence and just call it sculpture, and leave building to someone competent.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-scent-of-ink-on-paper.html#c6167307705939687413 title="comment permalink">10/16/15, 7:08 AM</a><br><br>

That's roughly how I imagine Lakeland sports being organized, with townships in place of parishes. <br><br>Martin, I'm far from sure today's newspapers deserve that kind of attention, but yes, I remember the same phenomenon!<br><br>Jason, a good clear summary. <br><br>Earthworm, as we'll be seeing in a couple of upcoming episodes, wages in the Lakeland Republic are kept relatively high, by eliminating those elements of the tax and regulatory codes that discourage hiring and drive down wages in today's America (and in some cases, replacing them with policies that have the reverse effect). Henry Ford's observation -- if the people you're hiring to build your product aren't being paid well enough to afford your product, you're doing it wrong -- is standard economic policy in the LR. Thus the waitstaff Carr tips are getting a living wage. The newsstand -- well, the woman who took his money there is the owner, and her income is dependent on how she manages in a very competitive business, of course. <br><br>Hereward, good heavens, no -- I wasn't offended, but thank you anyway. As for tipping leading to obsequiousness, hmm; I tend to tip as well as I can afford, and though I know it gets me better service at some of my regular haunts, it doesn't seem to generate any particular urge to grovel on the part of waitstaff. That may be another difference between cultures. <br><br>Mustard, I'm sorry to say that just about anything with wheels on it got used as a military transport during the Second Civil War -- yes, even Volkswagens -- and most of what survived on Lakeland territory was scrapped and had the metal parts melted down during the embargo years. <br><br>August, that doesn't surprise me at all.

Our local libraries are full of computer stations for kids and adults and walls of DVD's for rental. Gotta give people what they want, or so I am told.<br><br>I've read many of your thoughts on healthcare and looking forward to touring that part of Lakeland. One thing I've found truly puzzling about American healthcare is we completely or mostly cover retirees health expenses. Twice when I had surgery I shared a room with women in their 80's who had been in two weeks or more. They were each struggling to survive from an assortment of chronic and acute conditions I gathered from the various nurses, doctors etc. I'm estimating their daily cost in hospital was $25,000-$45,000 and I'm assuming all covered by our government.<br><br>Then there is me with two children and a husband having a necessary surgery to keep me functioning and we have to pay 20% of the cost of that and the overnight in the hospital. If I were to pass away right now, the impact of losing a mother and wage earner to our family and our community would be significant, and so we have to pay out the nose to stay this side of the dirt. <br><br>And I'll go there and say this.....i do not understand why the government competely covers the costs of extending the lives of people in their 80's or older. They have lived a full life and have no responsibilities of raising children or no longer can work. Then for every month or year their life is extended they collect social security - a system originally set up to pay out for a life expectancy of 65-67, not 78 years of age or more that people live to today (thanks to modern medicine and prescription drugs).<br><br>This extending of life (through extreme measure at times) seems to be one of those topics that just isn't ever brought up, although I think when it was touched on with the ACA it was quickly called "death panels" and dropped. But our thinking and approach to senior care has got to change because we just won't be able to pay to keep working people and seniors in the health care system. At the rate the cost has gone up, maybe five years it comes to a decision point? I keep waiting for a cultural shift in how we treat end of life for seniors. instead the big cultural shift has been mass shootings in schools and colleges.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-scent-of-ink-on-paper.html#c2634240141064588397 title="comment permalink">10/16/15, 11:17 AM</a><br><br>

Yes, I know that some people take offense at such things; no, I don't particularly care. (<i>The Archdruid Report</i> didn't rise out of total obscurity to attract a quarter of a million readers a month by avoiding controversy, you know.) There is, however, a specific reason for the inclusion, and the tone of some of the tirades makes me think that the reason is probably worth stating outright here. <br><br><b>Recovering the technologies of an older time does not require, or even imply, adopting the ideologies of that time</b>. Those of my readers who recall my posts on the "steampunk future" will recall the commenters who insisted that going back to Victorian technology inevitably had to mean bringing back child labor and so on. That's a common straw man, reliably pounded to chaff by the evangelists of the religion of progress. The same-sex couples, the women and people of color in positions of responsibility and authority, and a variety of other things that will be appearing in this narrative are there to forestall attempts to misinterpret and reject <i>Retrotopia</i> along those lines.<br><br>We could have a long discussion sometime about how the changes in the concept of marriage that have taken place in the western world over the last nine centuries or so have made same-sex marriage a reasonable option at this point in history, but that's somewhat beside the point just now. The thing I'm trying to get across is that technology is not destiny -- that a human society can choose the technologies it finds useful and valuable, and reject others, and it can also choose the social habits it finds useful and valuable, and reject others, <i>and these two sets of choices are in large part independent of one another</i>. A retro-tech society with emphatically non-retro social habits is a very effective tool for making that point.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-scent-of-ink-on-paper.html#c6538542011401538025 title="comment permalink">10/16/15, 11:30 AM</a><br><br>

It seems that so many of the thoughstopping pseudo-issues that dominate American partisan politics today will have been replaced by more serious and real world issues in that future world. For example, I sincerely doubt anyone in the 2060's will still be either Republican or Democrat and all the issues their adherents think of as eternal truths will have been revealed to be just as historically contingent and trivial as they are. For example, even if there are Christians left in some form in the 2060's Lakeland Republic, I doubt (or at the very least, very sincerely HOPE) that they'll no longer be practicing the form of Christian Republicanism you so brilliantly noted has more in common with Satanism than Jesus Christ.<br><br> In my own past days as a former member of the Religious Right before becoming a disillusioned agnostic, I can tell you that the ideology is astonishingly reductive (basically, every problem in the world, whether economic or social or political, can be reduced to a conspiracy theory of abortion and homosexuals, and occasionally, muslims, so voting Republican to ban abortion and ban homosexual marriage will be sufficient to solve all those problems.) I regret the way that the particularly fanatical sectors of this movement have hijacked Christianity itself and turned it basically into an extremist anti abortion group that sometimes carries out a few literal terrorist attacks on doctors or clinics. I don't think I even need to mention that banning abortion or banning homosexuals won't do much to solve our lack of cheap abundant energy, nor would it do much to prevent an economy that depends on that energy to not crumble into chaos and mass poverty, but it's a comforting narrative and the simpler the narrative, the greater the hope that a solution just as simple COULD work.<br><br>I think that in the 2060's, when the Republican and Democrat parties as we know them today are long forgotten bitter memories of a failed past, that CHrisitanity may be freed up to revision itself in more useful terms. Heck, it might even go back to stuff Jesus actually said in the Gospels.

Only when the tips go above that level do they go (supposedly) to the person who "received" the tip. In many cases it's even worse than that, often all tips that are "received" have to go into a pot and are then distributed by a pre-determined formula among the co-workers.

There used to be a gradation from high-style architecture down to vernacular construction. For the more prominent public buildings they'd hire a prominent artist, perhaps a goldsmith like Brunelleschi, who would prepare some renderings, then hand the work over to an executing architect, or master builder. For more modest buildings they'd engage a builder, who might indulge a client's whims, but who generally stayed within the bounds of tradition and good practice.

Part of it is the clout the AARP has, and worked very hard to get. Part of it is that seniors are apparently the votingest generation currently on deck; probably because we were reared to it from the cradle, and well into our adult years. The youngest of the War Babies was 20 when Kennedy was shot. <br><br>And part is the feeling "We're entitled to this; ***we paid into it all our working lives.****" (Even though that's not how these benefits work. Feelings are not rational. Also, we were reared to the concept and took it for granted clear into midlife.)<br><br>But, no, the imbalance is NOT fair to the younger people and children of today and well I know it. The question has never been put to me in any sort of vote, and writing one's congresscritter today without an organized bloc behind you, is paying nearly $0.50 to add to said congresscritter's overflowing paper recycling bin.<br><br><br>The question is, since these benefits are not transferable, what to do? Drop out of the healthcare system entirely?

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c196227648293230786></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/05554905422672638784 rel=nofollow>Unknown</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>(Deborah Bender)<br><br>In the United States, minimum wage applies to everyone who is paid hourly wages, AFAIK including waiters. There is a federal minimum wage which is not enough to support a full time wage earner except in states that have a very low cost of living, which are the poorest states. In most states, people who earn only the minimum federal wage are below the government standard poverty level and eligible to apply for various kinds of government support such as food assistance and some free medical care. States and cities may establish a minimum wage that is higher than the federal one and some do, particularly wealthier areas where rents are high. <br><br>I was a waitress long, long ago and I pay attention to working conditions in the occupation. People who tip usually tip on a percentage of the bill. As a result, tips are a more significant part of the pay of staff in expensive restaurants than in cheap cafes. This is partly offset by the fact that diners tend to linger over their meals more in expensive restaurants, so waiters there serve fewer customers. At the upper end places, it's not unusual for a 15 percent gratuity to be automatically added to the bill rather than leaving the amount of the tip to the customer. This is probably a protection for a waiter who spends all evening serving a table of big spenders and then gets stiffed.<br><br>Some restaurants and cafes have unionized staff; most do not. Tipping isn't influenced by that. In some restaurants, all tips have to be deposited in a common kitty and the hostess, bus boys and cooks, none of whom get tipped, receive a portion of it. <br> <br>Tips are taxable income. When I was a waitress, it was customary not to report most of one's tips, and at one cafe when I was hired, the other waitresses told me firmly what I should report in order to stay in line with what they were reporting. The Internal Revenue Service eventually dealt with that universal practice by making a blanket assumption that waiters get tipped a certain percentage of their regular wages, and adding that to their gross income regardless of whether the earner reports it (or received it) or not. So if you don't tip your server, he or she still gets taxed as if you had, up to a point. <br><br>I routinely tip a little above the median range. In the places where I am a regular, that sometimes makes a difference in small ways like quicker or more willing service on minor requests like drink refills or a special menu request. Depending on the personality of the waiter, it sometimes also inclines them to chat for a minute when they stop at my table. That's about it for special treatment. I tip because it's part of the social contract. <br><br>Being a waiter or a waitress is both lifetime work for some and an early job for young people of all classes and races. Because of the language requirement, it hasn't been taken over by immigrants the way dishwashing, table clearing, construction work and other entry level jobs have been. Consequently, the relationship between waiters and customers is a remnant of old American egalitarian attitudes, and isn't a servant-master relationship.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-scent-of-ink-on-paper.html#c196227648293230786 title="comment permalink">10/16/15, 12:44 PM</a><br><br>

Your point is well taken though that history retraces itself not directly. The tiers idea includes technological differences but deeper social change which the tiers differences would mean are not discussed. I find personally doing light physical activities like paperwork for a living and doing hard physical labor produces mentality changes. Since the crisis started I have made this shift successfully due to fitness. Basically I think hard labor at low tier societies results in conservative mind sets. High tier, low labor societies results in liberal mind sets as seen in toledo or modern san francisco. In other parts of the republic with lower tiers i suspect to find extreme conservative social laws approaching scarlet letter mentality. This is the problem with writing a schematic futurist story from above as opposed to an experiential novel from within an individual. This is where less is more, as long as it rings true for the individual, but one has to fight through the deep night of the soul, like each of shakespeare's sonnets is a deep personal story in short. For example if shakespeare were de vere and actually gay as suspected it makes no difference to the truth of those sonnets, but emphasizing the point simply loses its universality. Gays in the west have fought for their rights over decades but just like women's rights, technological liberation from familial support structures must btaken into consideration, anonymous metropolitan areas, cheapbirth control, women's equality forcing men from breadwinner role thereby emasculating them, empowering women, reversing emotional roles and encouraging if not directly a translation of personality into sexuality, i.e. in a bisexual personality, all that would count in a partner would be emotional preferences, not social conventions of an extended family, local churches. I had a single uncle, a care giver at a nursing home. I never suspected he was gay, until recently. In the 40s coming out was no option. In the 70s to 80s this was normal for my generation. I expect social regression to occur. We see in Europe the EU falling apart and nation states as well along ethnic divisions, scotland, catalonia, etc. To presume that ethnic cleansing and politically motivated cleansing of people of other social modes or religions or parties would not happen could only happen in an ivory tower as the wars described to break up America must be bloody. Would minorities, gays, women want rights associated with the hightech atlantic states, be perceived as traitors, be driven out, killed, subjugated? We would have to experience what life will be like. It is otherwise just speculation. <br><br>I think canned goods, mass marketing in large chain stores, Television keeping people from knowing neighbours all inhibits deeper community and social control, along with stron conventions. Anonymity brings promiscuity. See internet dating as example, having lots of partners in parallel is not amoral anymore or promiscuous, it is called polyamory. Gay rights is just the start. Try a lrgal marriage framework with everyone having multiple shifting relationships, partial child and property rights perhaps? Modern love life is getting to be like a regulated commune 60s style.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-scent-of-ink-on-paper.html#c6650330069047173173 title="comment permalink">10/16/15, 1:29 PM</a><br><br>

I am thinking that there is probably a split between the first 2 tiers and the last 3 simply due to how electricity comes into play which has an effect on the social &amp; political order. Electricity is an enabler for a whole range of other technological suites and on the face of it would be mostly available to the 5th and 4th tiers.<br> Yes, you can have these things in the other three tiers if you are prepared to pay for it but not if you face hostility on the part of your neighbours for doing so. Your Restorationists political party would probably find their political base in the 3rd, 2nd and 1st tiers and may be even puritanical about it to boot. Why else would they have wanted to force their views on rest of the Republic by trying to get rid of tier 5 (while not having to sacrifice anything themselves by such a move, of course) and are so sensitive to the costs of technology introduced.<br> Having electricity is not just a matter of having lights that can turn on. An article at http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/10/an-economic-history-of-leftovers/409255/ mentions that "Techniques like pickling, potting, smoking, and salting defined 19th-century cuisine because, before reliable refrigeration, cooking and food preservation were barely distinguishable tasks."<br> In other words, a large chunk of your time is spent preserving food as it cannot be simply put in a fridge. This may be part and parcel of a farmer's way of life but once you get into the range of occupations that a town or city employ, this is more problematical as there are so many hours in a week which was why as the electrical grid was introduced, refrigerator use skyrocketed in the twenties.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-scent-of-ink-on-paper.html#c8654003544412156057 title="comment permalink">10/16/15, 9:55 PM</a><br><br>

Advantages of Yaupon over chicory (or dandilion root for that matter). Yaupon tastes way more like tea than chicory tastes like coffee (and can be processed in either "green tea" or "black tea" style). Yaupon actually has caffeine, enough to be a stimulating drink. The labor involved in harvesting the usable part is less strenuous (no digging), less unpleasant (less bending over) and doesn't need any tools. Yaupon can prepared with less fuel inputs, dried and fermented, as opposed to chicory root which needs to be oven roasted. <br><br>Of course chicory can be put to many other uses than just a hot beverage, but using it as a hot beverage takes away from those other uses.

I moved back to Atlantic Canada in 2012 after living most of my life in the US (Philadephia area, Boston, California, Arizona) and then to Ireland. The funny part is that when I came here, living in a small community near the northern border, there are few in any chain stores, mostly small mom and pop shops. Like your Lakeland Republic, there is little advertising and you find most places by word of mouth. The initial impression is run down compared to bright shiny corporate America, but you find it feels better. I think the division between public services and private is well described in your story and people need to fight for that. Here in Ireland, people are fighting the privatisation of water by boycotting the Irish Water company set up to be solf off to Wall Street. Hopefully we can create more Lakeland Republics, but people will have to make those choices to stop using those cheap corporate services and support their local businesses...

If our BMI, cholesterol and blood pressure are under specific target numbers, then the company kicks some money into a health fund to cover deductible costs. Oh of course there is no smoking allowed.

President Lyndon Johnson in his first term attempted a massive expansion of New Deal social programs, some of which were labeled The War on Poverty. LBJ had the benefit of his party controlling both houses of Congress, extensive experience as a legislative leader, and the economy was still in post WWII expansion with plenty of tax money available (the escalation of the Vietnam War had barely begun). LBJ got most of his social legislative program passed.<br><br>At that time, a disproportionate percentage of poor people were elderly. Some of the War on Poverty programs aimed to reduce the numbers of elderly poor, and they succeeded, possibly because they were straightforward grants and subsidies to people who didn't have a lot of social problems other than lack of money.<br><br>The War on Poverty had mixed results for the other groups it was intended to help. The outcomes of the Vietnam War and Johnson's support of Civil Rights then resulted in a backlash against liberalism and in the Democratic Party gradually losing control of all three branches of government. Most of the War on Poverty programs were dismantled and replaced by a War on Drugs which severely impacted the poor. As Patricia Mathews wrote, the elderly have been well organized politically and have held on to their benefits and assistance programs while other groups have not.<br><br>2. One of the successful campaigns of the Right has been the near abolition of estate taxes. This is most beneficial to the wealthy, but during the fat years many middle class (mostly white) people also accumulated some wealth which they did not have to spend on to support themselves in old age because of the aforementioned government programs for the elderly. At the same time, family sizes were shrinking. Older Baby Boomers have benefited not only from receiving subsidized education and opportunities for decent jobs, but some of us have also received inheritances that amount to more than old furniture.<br><br>3. The generation which immediately followed the Boomers was small in number, and since the Boomers were older and had had time to entrench themselves in positions of economic, political and cultural power, the succeeding generation was blocked from succession and wasn't able effectively to defend its interests. <br><br>4. I generally agree with JMG's observation that during the 1970s-1990s, middle class voters readily sold out the working class to protect their own class interests. Now that the labor movement and other working class organizations are no longer available as allies, the middle class's position is untenable and it is disappearing. When it is gone, there will be no one left to protect the elderly. <br><br>5. The Millenarians are more numerous than the Baby Boomers now, and the developing generation gap is likely to become explosive.<br><br> I'm a tax-and-spend liberal for the most part and when asked to be taxed to support programs that give educational opportunity and a chance at a more decent life to people who don't have a lot of money, I usually consent. But I'm only one person.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-scent-of-ink-on-paper.html#c7729505304714984940 title="comment permalink">10/17/15, 12:52 PM</a><br><br>

What is interesting on the death certificates is that until the 1960's my ancestors died at home. I don't know if that was standard or just the fact they were laborers and farmers, and not of the managerial class. There was a space on the death certificate from the 1960's and older where the physician signing off could fill in details across several lines and there was a period of dying allowed. One great great grandfather was listed as on his death bed for 3 weeks before he died, and the person who was attending him was a neighbor and listed on the form also. The neighbor was also considered a witness of last breath. The physician also listed several causes leading up to the death such as injuries and chronic diseases.<br><br>Current death certificates have a date and time of death as if a person's switch got flipped off, and one cause is listed in a small space.

Pick your enemies carefully. Don't fall for divisive rhetoric. Plenty of baby boomer contemporaries of mine around here are pretty well off (more than I) but when they were in their 20s and 30s and even 40s they were really very poor. Poorer than some of the complainers here. They had outhouses. Woodstoves. Old cars or no cars. It takes years to get ahead. I never bought a house till I was 40. I lived hand to mouth until my mid 40s when my kids more or less took off. Only then could I catch up, and yes, I helped them through school. Their dad also helped them. They got scholarships and grants. They worked. And still they had student loans! And if things get rough out there, they know exactly where to head. I bought this place for all of us and they know it, although they may never live here.<br><br>It is silly to be angry with boomers for getting social security and medicare. This is the system that was in place and so they are part of it. Medicare was set up because a lot of old people were in poverty and too old to make any money. Back then, medical care was not a bubble. Paying for a surgery was difficult, but not impossible for a working family.

I enjoy my time exploring LLR through Carr's eyes and am always eager for more. I do understand your point about social mores, changes and what we see as advances not having to be connected to technological advances; buuuuuut, I'd have to agree with Ed Boyle. I do think it has a correlation with abundance or lack. I just suspect it is human nature, that in hard times we circle the wagons, become insular, become prejudiced and mistrustful of 'the others', latch onto a convenient scapegoat for our ills. Not a pretty part of human nature, but I do think it's there. IMHO, It would have taken a concerted effort on the part of normal everyday Lakelanders and their leaders to maintain the gains in social equality in the aftermath and hardship of the post-war years without falling prey to this worm of our baser instincts. <br><br>Maybe I am being too hard on people and they would not revert back to old prejudices. Maybe it's just my own 20th C. USA conditioning. <br><br>@Denys: Yikes! I'm hoping that you are just thinking out loud / throwing ideas out there for consideration…. <br><br> I don't think that 'Logan's Run' scenario would ever fly or be a great solution even if it did. I get that in older societies - where medical tech, knowledge and resources were limited - that people simply accepted the limitations of human lifespan - and that was (is) a healthy thing. I think it's crazy self destructive to actually strive for immortality.<br><br> I was under the impression that a Do Not Resuscitate option for elderly with severe health problems, (or anyone actually) is already a voluntary option in US hospitals, (no?), to be signed by the patient if they are of sound mind, to be signed by a family member if they are not. The key word being voluntary. <br><br>From a practical view - it sounds like, "My body is sick, my feet feel the worst and take up the most of my attention/resources, so I'll cut them off - then I can easily make myself well". The overall sickness is the problem, not solved by cutting the feet off. IMHO, Our overall insurance driven "healthcare" (sickness) industry is the problem, not that some patients cost more than others. Of course young healthy productive adults use up less resources - small children and the elderly use up the most - they are physically the most vulnerable in these organic mortal coils we inhabit. Where is the cut-off point in determining how productive one has to be to deserve available, but costly care? How costly is too much? Who decides? If it's OK to dispense with the costly unproductive elderly, what about Down's Syndrome babies or others born with severe disabilities? Will they ever be productive? Who determines what 'productivity' or usefulness is? Is my beloved wise Granny 'unproductive' if she can no longer get out of bed, just dispense advice, humor, wisdom and love from her bedside?<br><br>You know where I'm going with this right? Who it reminds us of? OK, yeah, it's 'Godwin's Law' :)<br><br><a href=retrotopia-scent-of-ink-on-paper.html#c3369670946844248298 title="comment permalink">10/17/15, 7:10 PM</a><br><br>

Most people that I know travel to other developed nations, but for some reason I was born with a contrary perspective (and also importantly a lean wallet) so in my younger days I travelled to third world countries and the people there were only too happy to share their opinions of our society. One classic was in Laos where Australian's were described in the terms: "Imperialist running dogs"; and the under-current of that culture looking down on us in scorn and pity was not lost on me. I don't travel much anywhere these days - especially now that I fully understand the true impact of such activities. Anyway, people seek confirmation bias and only want to hear what they want to hear and not something that may shock them.<br><br>Speaking of which I noticed that your introduction to the story plot of a gay marriage, brought out the usual homophobia and I've wondered for a long time about why some people seem to have such angst. I had a step father for a very short period of time that used to get drunk, beat my mother and go on long rants about gay people (including calling me that descriptive as an 8 year old - I mean seriously!). My gut feeling is that deep down people know that: what they contemplate, they imitate and therein lies the problem - such vocal concerns are a tacit acknowledgement of the individuals own insecurities.

Both as a senior who's seen it, and a reader of history, I agree wholeheartedly. Yes, a recovery from a crisis is indeed when people circle the wagons, vow "never again", and grow conservative. Driven by fear, as a child of a depression survivor noted in Studs Terkel's HARD TIMES. (Note: this is very enlightening, informative, and distressing, but do not make it your bedtime reading.)<br><br>That the details will be the same as last time, no. A different set of "others" will be defined, as note a headline from the online news that today's people fear robots more than death these days. Where the wagons are circled will change. During the Decline of Rome, the lines were religious, but within those lines there was "neither Jew nor Greek,slave nor free, citizen nor barbarian." <br><br>The post-Civil War era had a lot to say about the Irish, very little of it good, but in the McCarthy Era a few elders merely asked "Are you sure that youngster from Boston won't be answering to the Pope?" And were very roundly answered in the next election. <br><br>That said - the drive for same-sex *marriage* is actually part of that conservatism! Our beleagured age doesn't want flamboyantly costumed drag queens etc parading down the street except on Gay Pride Day; they want Janet and Eve next door, raising a family and joining the neighborhood association. This from observation. Come to think of it, St. Patrick's Day is the only day when the old Irish stereotypes are lovingly brought out of the closet and celebrated, too. <br><br>I do think the next drive for inclusion will be the incorporation of the "good" i.e. loyal Muslims.

I worked in privately owned places, and, a few times, big corporate outfits. I never minded sharing tips. The bus people and dish washers worked very hard and helped keep the whole enterprise spinning.<br><br>I don't know if it still exists, but besides the low base wages, due to the "tip credit", in Washington State in the 70's, there was also the "meal credit." Even if you didn't take a meal during a shift, the meal credit was still applied, even if you didn't eat the stuff you were serving. That drove your hourly wage down, even lower.<br><br>Here's my situation as an old retired guy. For awhile, I got government help to pay part of my medicare costs (part B) and, my prescription drug costs (part D). No great loss there. I am on no medication. I also got a bit of help on my telephone costs (about $10 a month) from the State. Then I inherited a small amount of money from my Dad's estate. All those things ended. To get State aid, you can't have more than $7,000 worth of assets. To get Federal Government aid, you can't have more than $20,000 in assets.<br><br>My "free", welcome to Medicare check up had many hidden costs. Even though I hadn't been to a doctor in 15 years, and the doctor I saw thought some lab tests were necessary, they were not covered. I appealed. The appeal goes, not to the Government, but has been outsourced (as have many other things we don't generally know about) to a private company, Noridian. <br><br>If I have a health problem, I'll still be expected to pay 20% of costs. Which, at the current cost of health care, and my finances, I will not be able to afford. So, I'm taking most of that inheritance and getting all my end of life directives, in order. Carefully choosing my medical directive representative (no heroic efforts, do not resuscitate, pull the plug). I'm pretty pragmatic. the trick is, finding someone who is equally pragmatic ... and is in good enough health to survive me. :-).

I have been totally impressed by your erudition and incredibly readable, yet accurate, essays. I think you are one of the preeminent thinkers of the day. I have never commented before, but have a couple of comments that I would like to share. Besides, I also feel it is time I took part in this wonderful conversation. <br>Regarding tips, it is hard to overestimate their importance for those in the service industry in the U.S. My prime example is that of my daughter, who has been a server in restaurants in Honolulu for years. She is working on her AA degree at the same time. She got a new position this summer, working the poolside shift at a nice resort hotel. This entailed 8 hour shifts in 90 plus degree weather, walking back and forth with heavy trays and remaining pleasant the whole time. She called me in tears when she got her first paycheck. It was for $165 for 88 hours of work for 2 weeks! It turns out that the hotel subtracts taxes for the amount of tips they presume she made (from the pay rate of $7.75/hr), as well as all the other miscellaneous deductions included. I doubt many of the servers manage to figure out if they have made less tips than is assumed, and if they did could they get HR to reduce the tax? Clearly without the tips she could not afford to eat, let alone pay rent! <br>My other comment is to do with the (inherent?) conservatism of farmers. I found this discussed in a fascinating book called Women’s Work, the First 20,000 Years, by Elizabeth Barber. Her point was that both women and subsistence farmers tend not to be willing to try new technologies because they don’t have the time to waste or the seed to risk on unknown results. It was how she explained that it was men, not women, who actually invented the spinning jenny and clothing related technologies. With everyday tasks or raising children, making clothes, cooking food, and otherwise maintaining the household, there just wasn’t time left in the day. For farmers, if they used their seed crop on a new method of farming, and it failed, they would all die of starvation over the winter. The risk just was not worth the possible failure.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-scent-of-ink-on-paper.html#c4817599281653871843 title="comment permalink">10/18/15, 6:41 PM</a><br><br>

Lets put it this way, lots felt uncomfortable about it as a ethical issue, but mostly felt it should be up to the consciences of those involved. It was definitely not a red-line, heresy-detecting issue. I still remember the mental "change of gears" that made this happen (late 70's early 80's) even though evangelicals my age today will mostly tell you "we were always against abortion" - so that's how quickly a thing like that can change, and lose awareness that it changed.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-scent-of-ink-on-paper.html#c44372312873822739 title="comment permalink">10/19/15, 12:22 AM</a><br><br>

My Irish catholic working class father voted left butwas socially conservative in terms of behaviour, savings, work, investment vehaviour, church going and had inherent antigay and racist tendencies. He could however travel easily, mix with any people from anywhere due to his temperament and got used to us kides with our mixed racial, sexual, ethnic partners. My middle class university educated , protestant,british mother was conservative politically but more tolerant socially and less racist than my working class father. Due to this strange mixture of influences I have difficulties with these labels. As I live in germany where any american would see a socialist paradise with a hard work ethic, moderate social attitudes to abortuion, gays, religion it is more difficult to latch on to American concepts. I suppose the constant mass immigration, religious and ethnic mixing, technological development are misused by corporate interests to manipulate the political debate to divide and conquer. It also seems that money is less important to people than sexual or racial identity. So the banks can control the debate and hide their real agenda. Women's liberation means cheap workers for example. This is manipulation. Once women are free of male support and birth of children is optional then heterosexuality afterr several decades for new generation is widespread. Gay marriage shows gays are conservative too. Polyamory will be next wave of sexual chaos where defined relationships will be oldfashioned and marriage to just one person will be passe. Take Islam. In Europe and America it is suspect and radical. In Russia it is a long established conservative part of a conservative tradition similar to orthodoxy. Read saker on this point. Will an economic breakdown in Europe result in pogroms against islam with jews, african and Arab christians being accepted as European? In American collapse who will be scapegoat? Falun gong served recently in china. Moderate centrist opinion nowadays is government whereas internet mob is extremist left and right, sanders vs. Trump. NSDAP intelligently combined both as JMG once pointed out to bring workers wanting communism together with conservatives, middle class nationalists. Trup could try similar by ignoring ideology completely and even teaming up with Putin and Chinese to create a new global system based on gold, respect for borders, relative isolationism and protection of status quo in current social terms until current immigrants, sexual mores are digested. In this case EU could make a big house with Russia and peace in middle East based on noninterventionism of Western powers would be accepted. Putin's gambit is critical as is Merkel's fate for Europe. By the time of US elections a lot more will be clear.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-scent-of-ink-on-paper.html#c1213824494443025143 title="comment permalink">10/19/15, 1:00 AM</a><br><br>

It's weird that Lakeland has open borders that people are migrating across but it doesn't have an embassy for the Atlantic Republic. It's weird that Carr has a prearranged meeting with the higher ups in LL but his administration doesn't have access to their news papers. It's weird that LL has business relationships with other countries and ship born trade but that the intel folks in AR seem to have a total gap in their knowledge from after the war to the present.<br><br> I can see the AR administration being completely dependent on the metanet but the reverse wouldn't be true. Lakeland should have ambassadors in neighboring countries, especially if it has thriving trade relationships with them. Carr is probably clueless about LL because he is part of a new administration and his culture doesn't put any stock in their low tech ways so the old administration probably ignored them. My guess is that he is there to begin the process of normalizing relations between the two countries, probably a part of the new administration's plans to benefit from it somehow. How, I don't know, I'm not picking up anything malicious from him.<br><br> We'll find out in time.

I work for a mechanical contractor in the St. Louis area. Yesterday, the touch screen for one of our automated press brakes went haywire and had to be over-nighted to British Columbia for repairs. I asked the lead man for the sheet metal shop if they were down without that piece of equipment. After a moment of reflection, he stated that they were not. They would have to bend larger pieces of metal by hand and it would take longer because measurements and stops weren't automated. My point to him was that he was out of practice because of the reliance on technology. At least the Union he was in had taught more than just pushing buttons.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-scent-of-ink-on-paper.html#c1251032307025910743 title="comment permalink">10/20/15, 7:37 AM</a><br><br>

So they should not exist. I am compiling a spreadsheet classifying all the jobs currently available in the current economy in broad categories, and scoring each category according to certain criteria (such as the opposites of the ones above, but also cost efficiency, money made per hour of labor, etc), then multiplying each score by a coefficient that depends on one's value hierarchy. According to the prevailing value hierarchy of the global industrial market (with cost efficiency and money made as top values) most current jobs are not so bad for those who are good at them (which for waiters means getting alot of tips). But if you value the soul, community and nature, then the current economy is dismal. Pre-industrial economies are usually much better. Not sure about Lakeland Republic--so far I have seen mostly services and distribution of goods being provided with less intermediation and more personalism. But what about PRODUCTION of goods, the shadow of our current economy which we don't want to talk about too much because it is nasty and putrid?<br><br><a href=retrotopia-scent-of-ink-on-paper.html#c4836880991887970759 title="comment permalink">10/20/15, 8:53 AM</a><br><br>
