<div class=MsoNormal>
This is the seventh installment of an exploration of some of the possible futures discussed on this blog, using the toolkit of narrative fiction. Our narrator visits a streetcar factory, asks some hard questions about the use of human labor in place of machines, and gets some answers he doesn’t expect...</div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
***********</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The phone rang at 8 am sharp, a shrill mechanical sound that made me wonder if there was actually a bell inside the thing. I put down the Toledo <i>Blade</i> and got it on the second ring. “Hello?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Mr. Carr? This is Melanie Berger. I’ve got—well, not exactly good news, but it could be worse.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I laughed. “Okay, I’ll bite. What’s up?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“We’ve managed to get everyone to sit down and work out a compromise, but the President’s got to be involved in that. With any luck this whole business will be out of the way by this afternoon, and he’ll be able to meet with you this evening, if that’s acceptable.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That’ll be fine,” I said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Good. In the meantime, we thought you might want to make some of the visits we discussed with your boss earlier. If that works for you—”
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“It does.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Can you handle being shown around by an intern? He’s a bit of a wooly lamb, but well-informed.” I indicated that that would be fine, and she went on. “His name’s Michael Finch. I can have him meet you at the Capitol Hotel lobby whenever you like.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Would half an hour from now be too soon?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Not at all. I’ll let him know.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We said the usual polite things, and I hung up. Twenty-five minutes later I was down in the lobby, and right on time a young man in a trenchcoat and a fedora came through the doors. I could see why Berger had called him a wooly lamb; he had blond curly hair and the kind of permanently startled expression you find most often in interns, ingenues, and axe murderers. He looked around blankly even though I was standing in plain sight. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Mr. Finch?” I said, crossing the lobby toward him. “I’m Peter Carr.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
His expression went even more startled than usual for a moment, and then he grinned. “Pleased to meet you, Mr. Carr.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You surprised me—I was expecting to see someone dressed in that plastic stuff.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’m not fond of being stared at,” I said with a shrug. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He nodded, as though that explained everything. “Ms. Berger told me you wanted to visit some of our industrial plants and the Toledo stock market. Unless you have something already lined up, we can head down to the Mikkelson factory first and go from there. We could take a cab if you like, or just catch the streetcar—the Green line goes within a block of the plant. Whatever you like.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I considered that, decided that a good close look at Lakeland public transit was in order. “Let’s catch the streetcar.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Sure thing.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We left the lobby, and I followed Finch’s lead along the sidewalk to the right. The morning was crisp and bright, with an edge of frost, and plenty of people were walking to work. A fair number of horsedrawn cabs rolled by, along with a very few automobiles. I thought about that as we walked. Toledo’s tier had a base date of 1950, or so the barber told me the day before, but I didn’t think that cars were anything like so scarce on American streets in that year. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We turned right and came to the streetcar stop, where a dozen people were already waiting. I turned to Finch. “The Mikkelson factory. What do they make?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For answer he pointed up the street. Two blocks up,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the front end of a streetcar was coming into sight as it rounded the corner. “Rolling stock for streetcar lines. We’ve got three big streetcar manufacturers in the Republic, but Mikkelson’s the biggest. The Toledo system runs their cars exclusively.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The streetcar finished the turn, sped up, and rolled to a stop in front of us. Strictly speaking, I suppose I should say “streetcars,” since there were four cars linked together, all of them painted forest green and yellow with brass trim. We lined up with the others, climbed aboard when our turn came, and Finch pushed a couple of bills down into the fare box and got a couple of paper slips—“day passes,” he explained—from the conductor. There were still seats available, and I settled into the window seat as the conductor rang a bell, ding-di-ding-di-ding, and the streetcar hummed into motion. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It was an interesting ride, in an odd way. I travel a lot, like most people in my line of work, and I’ve ridden top-of-the-line automated light rail systems in New Beijing and Brasilia. I could tell at a glance that the streetcar I was on cost a small fraction of the money that went into those high-end systems, but the ride was just as comfortable and nearly as fast. There were two employees of the streetcar system on board, a driver and a conductor, and I wondered how much of the labor cost was offset by the lower price of the hardware. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The streetscape rolled past. We got out of the retail district near my hotel and into a residential district, with a mix of apartment buildings and row houses and a scattering of other buildings: an elementary school with a playground outside, a public library, two churches, a couple of other religious buildings of various kinds, and then a big square building with a symbol above the door I recognized at once. I turned to Finch. “I wondered whether there were Atheist Assemblies here.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Oh, yes. Are you an Atheist, Mr. Carr?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I didn’t see any reason to temporize. “Yes.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Wonderful! So am I. If you’re free this coming Sunday, you’d be more than welcome at the Capitol Assembly—that’s this one here.” He motioned at the building we were passing. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’ll certainly consider it,” I said, and he beamed. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By the time we got to the factory the streetcar was crammed to the bursting point, mostly with people who looked like office staff, and the sidewalks were full of men and women heading toward the factory gates for the day shift. We got off with almost everyone else, and I followed Finch down another sidewalk to the front entrance of the business office, a sturdy-looking two-story structure with MIKKELSON MANUFACTURING in big letters above the second story windows and in gold paint on the glass of the front door. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The receptionist was already on duty, and picked up a telephone to announce us. A few minutes later a middle-aged woman in a dark suit came out to shake our hands. “Mr. Carr, pleased to meet you. I’m Elaine Chu. So you’d like to see our factory?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A few minutes later we’d exchanged our hats, coats and jackets for safety helmets and loose coveralls of tough gray cloth. “Just under half the streetcars manufactured in the Lakeland Republic are made right here,” Chu explained as we walked down a long corridor. “We’ve also got plants in Louisville and Rockford, but those supply the railroad industry—Rockford makes locomotives and Louisville’s our plant for rolling stock. Every Mikkelson streetcar comes from this plant.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We passed through double doors onto the shop floor. I was expecting a roar of machine noise, but there weren’t a lot of machines, just workers in the same gray coveralls we were wearing, picking up what looked like hand tools and getting to work. There were streetcar tracks running down the middle of the shop floor, and I watched as a team of workers bolted two wheels, an axle, and a gear together and sent it rolling down the track to the next team. Metal parts clanged and clattered, voices echoed off the metal girders that held up the roof, and now and then some part got pulled from the line and chucked into a big cart on its own set of tracks. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Quality control,” Chu said. “Each team checks each part or assembly as it comes down the line, and anything that’s not up to spec gets pulled and either disassembled or recycled. That’s one of the reasons we have so large a share of the market. Our streetcars average twenty per cent less downtime for repairs than anybody else’s.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We followed the wheel assemblies down the shop floor from the team that assembled them into four-wheel bogies, through the teams that built a chassis with electric motors and wiring atop each pair of bogies, to the point where the body was hauled in on a heavily-built overhead suspension track and bolted onto the chassis. From there we went back up another long corridor to the assembly line that built the bodies. It was all a hum of activity, with dozens of tools I didn’t recognize at all, but every part of it was powered by human muscle and worked by human hands. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I think we’d been there for about two hours when we got to the end of the line, and watched a brand new Mikkelson streetcar get hooked up to overhead power lines, tested one last time, and driven away on tracks to the siding where it would be loaded aboard a train and shipped to its destination—Sault Ste. Marie, Chu explained, which was expanding its streetcar system now that the borders were open and trade with Upper Canada had the local economy booming. “So that’s the line from beginning to end,” she said. “If you’d like to come this way?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We went back into the business office, shed helmets and coveralls, and proceeded to her office. “I’m sure you have plenty of questions,” she said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“One in particular,” I replied. “The lack of automation. Nearly everything you do with human labor gets done in other industrial countries by machines. I’m curious as to how that works—economically as well as practically—and whether it’s a matter of government mandates or of something else.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I gathered from her expression that she was used to the question. “Do you have a background in business, Mr. Carr?” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I nodded, and she went on. “In the Atlantic Republic, if I understand correctly—and please let me know if I’m wrong—when a company spends money to buy machines, those count as assets; that’s how they appear on the books, and there are tax benefits from depreciation and so on. When a company spends the same money to do the same task by hiring employees, they don’t count as assets, and you don’t get any of the same benefits. Is that correct?” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I nodded again.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“On the other hand, if a company hires employees, it has to spend much more than the cost of wages or salaries. It has to pay into the public social security system, public health care, unemployment, and so on and so forth, for each person it hires. If the company buys machines instead, it doesn’t have to pay any of those things for each machine. Nor is there any kind of tax to cover the cost to society of replacing the jobs that went away because of automation, or to pay for any increased generating capacity the electrical grid might need to power the machines, or what have you. Is that also correct?” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Essentially, yes,” I said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“So, in other words, the tax codes subsidize automation and penalize employment. You probably were taught in business school that automation is more economical than hiring people. Did anyone mention all the ways that public policy contributes to making one more economical than the other?” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“No,” I admitted. “I suppose you do things differently here.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Very much so,” she said with a crisp nod. “To begin with, if we hire somebody to do a job, the only cost to Mikkelson Manufacturing is the wages or salary, and any money we put into training counts as a credit against other taxes, since that helps give society in general a better trained work force. Social security, health care, the rest of it, all of that comes out of other taxes—it’s not funded by penalizing<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>employers for hiring people.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“And if you automate?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Then the costs really start piling up. First off, there’s a tax on automation to pay the cost to society of coping with an increase in unemployment. Then there’s the cost of machinery, which is considerable, and then there’s the natural-resource taxes—if it comes out of the ground or goes into the air or water, it’s taxed, and not lightly, either. Then there’s the price of energy. Electricity’s not cheap here; the Lakeland Republic has only a modest supply of renewable energy, all things considered, and it hasn’t got any fossil fuels to speak of, so the only kind of energy that’s cheap is the kind that comes from muscles.” She shook her head. “If we tried to automate our assembly line, the additional costs would break us. It’s a competitive business, and the other two big firms would eat us alive.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I suppose you can’t just import manufactured products from abroad.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“No, the natural-resource taxes apply no matter what the point of origin is. You may have noticed that there aren’t a lot of cars on the streets here.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I did notice that,” I said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Fossil fuels here don’t get the government subsidies here they get almost everywhere else, and there’s the natural-resource taxes on top of that, for the fuel that’s burnt and the air that’s polluted. You can have a car if you want one, but you’ll pay plenty for the privilege, and you’ll pay even more for the fuel if you want to drive it.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I nodded; it all made a weird sort of sense, especially when I thought back to some of the other things I’d heard earlier. “So nobody’s technology gets a subsidy,” I said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Exactly. Here in the Lakeland Republic, we’re short on quite a few resources, but one thing there’s no shortage of is people who are willing to put in an honest day’s work for an honest wage. So we use the resource we’ve got in abundance, rather than becoming dependent on things we don’t have.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“And would have to import from abroad.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Exactly. As I’m sure you’re aware, Mr. Carr, that involves considerable risks.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
I wondered if she had any idea just how acutely I was aware of those. I put a bland expression on my face and nodded. “So I’ve heard,” I said.</div>

In 'Religion for Atheists', Alain de Botton recommends that atheists take a close look at the institutions that have grown up around the major religions, due to the way they nurture our human nature. As well as community, self-care and care for the vulnerable, they promote a certain amount of self-regulation and introspection which can otherwise be missed in daily life: "We need institutions to foster and protect those emotions to which we are sincerely inclined, but which, without a supporting structure and a system of active reminders, we will be too distracted and undisciplined to make time for."<br><br>I do hope that the Atheist Assemblies provide all this and more... interfaith gatherings with the Quakers and the Druids, for instance... <br><br>On a different note, several weeks ago, JMG, you asked how it might be possible to prevent Tasmania becoming Australia's gated community for the rich and powerful in the likely event that global warming makes life on the mainland unbearable. Well, frankly, I have no idea. BUT, after spending some weeks thinking about this I have come to one conclusion. It is not enough to spend my life tending my vegie garden and making sure my own little patch of suburbia is as low-impact and recession-proof as possible. While that is important as a first step (literally getting my house in order), I have to go out of my front gate and engage in my community as well. <br><br>I am not entirely sure how yet, or what earthly use I could be when I do, but I am sure something will turn up. That is how these things work, isn't it? Middle-aged housewife ventures outside front gate and saves world?

You've laid out the worker v machine axis* beautifully, but I've often had thoughts about a different one. What if you reversed your balance sheet values such that shareholders were a liability and the equity belonged to the workers? This would immediately reveal the extent to which shareholders have dragged the worker's share of productivity down through succeeding decades, and in any sane economy, rendering themselves uncompetitive in doing so. It would also reveal the reason that CEO pay as a multiple of lowest worker pay has gone through the rook, as your average CEO is being rewarded for success in a single task. Snagging a greater &amp; greater share of productivity rewards away from workers and towards shareholders. <br><br>*I live in a fishing port which has systematically destroyed perhaps a 1000-2000 fish filleting and processing jobs (in a town of 3,000 and a hinterland of maybe 3x that many - but home to 20-30 millionaire factory/boat owners) over the past two decades using mechanisation, a great deal of which was publicly grant aided.

Basically yoga is going mainsream to football team training, weight lifters, etc. as just the smart thing to do to stay healthy, happy and fit. A pure mental approach is 19th century with church pews and sermons and logic. One has to experience truth. Jesus said 'you will kno the truth and the truth will set you free.' Being a bit bawdy I could assert that knowing in the old testament sense of Adam knew Eve is closer to what he meant than intellectual knowledge. Heinlein called it grokking. This is not a pladyer/ad for yoga. I just think an atheist assembly will be unrealistic in the coming mentality which distrusts rationalism completely including estern religios rationalism.

A very nice idea, too bad politicians have forgotten that word - mind you, forgetting that word also helps them disguise that there is actually very little to differentiate between them.<br><br>We have the biggest tram network on the planet down here and you may be interested to note that originally the cars were powered by horses. Then came some sort of underground cable system - which I believe is still there under the rails. And finally the electric sort.<br><br>When I was younger they had timber trams (also plush leather seats) with conductors and you described it pretty much as I remember it. Those timber trams still run in the city today. On a hot day it was nice because the windows could be opened and the cooling breeze blew through the tram car.<br><br>Now interestingly too, I also recall (and I'm not that old) the old red rattler timber railway trains down here which were reasonably similar in style to the trains. I must add though that the country trains nowadays are very nice and very fast and I can get to the city much faster than driving there and it dumps me right in the middle of the city too.<br><br>I don't have any more to add other than I agree with your story 100% - I'm all for getting my hands dirty and putting in an honest and hard day’s work whether it is here or for my clients.<br><br>So instead, I'll tell you a funny story. This morning I had to visit a shop and the person I had to speak with was on the phone so I was unfortunately exposed to the horrors of early morning television. I had not been exposed to that before and all I can say is that we all must be wary of exposing ourselves to market forces! Hehe! Well I thought that was amusing...<br><br>Anyway, as the volume was so loud I could not ignore it I started noticing that in between doing product demonstrations, there was a well presented lady talking about optimism and how the lack of it is some sort of psychological disorder (which she can help with for a fee) - I'm not kidding you. There was also a male and female presenter listening to this dialogue and to the credit of the female presenter she was leaning far back and away from the well-presented lady - but the whole thing was weird.<br><br>And then it got weirder, because during one of the advertisement breaks, I noticed one of the pleasant young ladies who was flogging an insurance product (I think it was that anyway) had on her tee-shirt the word: "Progressive". I cannot make this stuff up, I felt that I had descended into a layer of Hell...<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br>PS: I've got a new blog entry up: <a href=http://ferngladefarm.blogspot.com.au/ rel=nofollow>Scrapping</a> where I discuss how Toothy the dachshund earned his name. It is an amusing story, but more importantly it involves the chickens so I had to do something about it and the chicken projects gets ever more interesting and complex! I did a day of digging in the hot sun to get the new berry bed completed and moved a couple of cubic metres (cubic yards) of organic matter into it and planted out various berries into it. I also show in a lot of cool photos how the place is enjoying the weird weather down here and also there is a few more cool photos showing some of the local birds.

Once again got me thinking. I was watching a live BBC programme the other day, where the presenters were in the UK BMW factory which builds the mini. A new car is produced every minute (or just under). The factory uses the ‘just in time principle’, which normal practice in this industry. If there is any delay in sub components reaching the factory, production is affected. What struck me was how little resilience the whole process had. It takes very little in the way of unexpected circumstances to stuff the whole thing. In addition, staff building the cars (admittedly robots do the lion share), are so specialised that they are only involved in small parts of the construction process, eg fitting the tail gate. Again, this seems so lacking in resilience. A business involved in restoring classic cars, in contrast, seems more resilient. Staff have a wider range of skills, vehicles are made from more basic components which can be refurbished, repaired or substituted, and sources of work could be diversified, should the economy take a down turn.

Humans are used in favor of machines because the tax structure makes humans cheaper...but only so long as wages remain low relative to those tax penalties. At the same time, human labor is also cheap because it's something the Lakeland Republic has in abundance. That would push wages down even further without some kind of counteracting economic force.<br><br>Such a force could take the form of minimum wage laws, labor unions, or the simple fact that in a land with so many small farms and such a vibrant home economy, workers may be free to decide that's it's simply more economical to work at home than to take a job that pays too little.<br><br>I also recall an earlier blog post (not sure if it was by you or someone else) that discussed slavery and prison labor in low-tech, low-energy societies that had a surplus of human labor. It's generally been the case that the cheapest way of doing something is the way most taken for granted and carelessly abused, whether that's fossil fuels or human workers. What safeguards (if any) does the Lakeland Republic have to prevent this from becoming the case. I'm assuming they must have done something, given that the poor immigrants we saw on the train from the Atlantic Republic believed they'd have a much better life in the Lakeland Republic.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-question-of-subsidies.html#c1048397778373126628 title="comment permalink">10/22/15, 7:04 AM</a><br><br>

Somewhere there has to be a 100-200HP steam engine running a system of shafts and belts that turn lathes, milling and drilling machines. Pure hand tools won't cut it (pardon the pun!).

I doubt if it’s enough to have one team just put together a couple of wheels and an axel all day - that team is probably doing a lot more than just that one job.<br><br>on capital: I noticed someone picked up on the notion that the workers own the plant and the investors are in a similar position to bondholders - they get paid a variable dividend based on profits instead of fixed interest, and get their principle returned in quarterly payments as well so they don’t have a perpetuity.

A country that deliberately chooses technological regression, however good it is for its people and economy, leaves itself vulnerable to domination by rivals with more 'advanced' military technology, backed by equally 'advanced' industrial capability. The Lakeland Republic is apparently secure within its borders and has not suffered any recent incursions from the Atlantic Republic despite the disparity of military technology suites. Considering that the Atlantic Republic is an extrapolation of current trends, a prosperous neighbour on the other side of a land-border with a far less 'advanced' military technology suite would be a tempting target.

It is not the same tired futurist or Friedmanite capitalist b.s. that I have watched not actually work and in fact make everything worse for quite literally and exactly my ENTIRE LIFE, but rather a positing of the Great Question that haunts my (one or two, the demographers refuse to be clear) generation:<br><br>The past was certainly better than today, what things did they have in the past that made this so?<br><br>One editorial note if that would be helpful: I think with just a word or two it could be clearer that Carr did not in fact witness an entire streetcar being assembled in two hours but rather multiple cars in stages of assembly.

Hate "Upper Canada" -- especially the implication it extends to Sault St.Marie. Toomas, in a comment to an earlier post, talked about "Toronto the Good". I'd tell you what the rest of the province thinks about Toronto, but then you could not publish my comment. Let me try, without profanity: a supperating bowl of leeches; a running sore; a cancer. No offense intended to Thoomas Karmo or those who live in the supposed 'center of the universe' (a phrase they use only half-ironically), but you benefit immensely from a wealth pump on the rest of the province, and, frankly, we kind of hate you for it. I was speaking to a couple who live east of Kingston the other day, and made the mistake of identifying their hamlet as part of Southern Ontario. Their response? "No, no! We're in <i>Eastern</i> Ontario. Don't lump us in with those [illegitimate children]." (Quote modified for our host's profanity policy.) <br><br>I could detail some of the effects of the wealth pump, but why bother? No need to rant for pages. It is ever thus, and the center always has self-satisfied excuses for their privilege. My point is that if the country that holds us together comes apart, the centrifugal forces on the regions of Ontario will be huge, and nostalgia coming from Toronto's richest suburb for a name many will barely recall is too weak a centripital counter force. <br><br>In school, we learn two things about "Upper Canada", or perhaps three: first, that it was ruled by an ogliarchy called the Family Compact, second, that the common people rebelled and failed, and third, if they pay any attention to the map, that it extended as far North as what the Muskoka area, what Toronto calls 'Cottage Country'.

William Lyon Mackenzie, in taking up arms, did not have the support of all the commons. Many of the working and farming class, on the contrary, sided with the Crown. Toronto in 1837 was no 1789 Bastille. It is true that there was widespread 1837 discontent in the commons - a discontent which I for one heartily endorse - with the "Family Compact" oligarchy (in other words, with the lack of a parliamentary authority fully answerable to the electorate), and with a public atmosphere chilling to freedom of the press. But these complaints of the commons were addressed by reforms instituted after Lord Elgin wrote his (1848??) report for the Crown. Indeed the very Wikipedia article which Mr August uses sums up these colonial politics in a single trenchant, and error-correcting, sentence: "The Family Compact emerged from the War of 1812 and collapsed in the aftermath of the Rebellions of 1837." <br><br>A little postscript on terminology may be helpful here. "Upper Canada" was official from 1791 to 1841. This term was superseded by "Canada West". But "Canada West" had nothing to do with the Prairies and the Rockies. "Canada West" meant, rather, the western, i.e., the Upper-Canada, half of the big "United Province of Canada". The still bigger Dominion of Canada came into existence in 1867, by roping in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia and making provisions for eventual provincial legislatures all the way out to the Pacific coast. "Upper Canada" is in use here and there in our common speech, most notably in discussions of architectural or other cultural forms of colonial heritage, and in the name of our bar association - "Law Society of Upper Canada". <br><br>We additionally do well to remind ourselves that William Lyon Mackenzie, after some years of USA exile, returned to Toronto, serving once again in the Legislative Assembly. I would urge Tyler Johnson to walk through the house museum near St Michael's Cathedral, at 82 Bond Street in Toronto. The museum preserves, as a fly is preserved in amber, Mr Mackenzie's soberly constrained domestic arrangements from the time his second Legislative Assembly career ended and friends helped him stay decently housed. <br> <br>I now recapitulate my principal point, which is a double point. (a) Far from it being the case that "the common people rebelled and failed", the 1837 rebellion was undertaken only by a faction within the commons. (b) Far from it being the case that the rebellion failed, its goals were, under the perspicacious recommendations of Lord Elgin, attained. <br><br>((((posting continued below, with points (B) and (C) )))) <br><br><br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-question-of-subsidies.html#c386763667078205702 title="comment permalink">10/23/15, 1:03 PM</a><br><br>

The wealthiest is not Richmond Hill. It <i>may</i> be far-away Oakville. So far as the immediate vicinity of Richmond Hill is concerned, the smart money is these days flowing not into Richmond Hill but into neighbouring Aurora. <br><br>I must additionally remark, lest anyone be under misapprehensions, that I am myself remarkably and egregiously and outstandingly poor, having sacrificed the bulk of my life savings to Richmond Hill's David Dunlap Observatory forest-conservation case. (We in essence lost: much detail can be had from Google News, by searching on the obvious terms. What is saved is 45 hectares out of 77. That is loss, not victory.) <br><br>Finally, (C) I should correct one of the Mr August's misspellings. "Supperating bowl of leeches" suggests something to do with the serving of leeches at supper (a culinary experiment with, admittedly, potential advantages). What, however, Tyler August likely meant was "suppurating bowl of leeches" (i.e., "bowl oozing pus"; here there is no culinary reference). <br><br><br>Hoping these comments help, <br>and looking forward to further advocacy and debate from this podium, <br><br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo, in Richmond Hill, <br>approx 25 km north of Toronto core, <br>perhaps 10 km south of Aurora<br><br><a href=retrotopia-question-of-subsidies.html#c1038378594434810655 title="comment permalink">10/23/15, 1:04 PM</a><br><br>

I have made this precise distinction in email exchanges with the late Chris Hitchens, and with Richard Dawkins.

Skeptic, free thinker, and the like, are terms that fairly represent my state of mind on such matters. And, again, the availability of a place wherein others might share ideas is good. I truly doubt that many discussions of gods would take place in any event, there being no real vocabulary available for such. <br><br>And, I doubt many would attend regularly, should such become available; nor would Sunday be any better for such meetings than Tuesday or Friday.

So the more medical needs the workforce has the less profits there are for the 1% running things. We are a non-public company and family owned so at least Corporate management doesn't have to please shareholders, but the owner started the company in 1945 and is in his 80s. While he is very "my employees are family" we are worried what his heirs will do when he kicks the bucket.<br><br>Also remember a long term employee costs more and more money, as they get raises. Training will increase the employee's efficiency to a certain point, usually 2-3 years of steady work, after that they level off. So a company is paying more and more for a piece of equipment that doesn't make them any more money.<br><br><br>Funny thing about a "shortage of is people who are willing to put in an honest day’s work for an honest wage". I had a discussion with our plant manager the other day. He was saying he leaning towards hiring just people over 40. Of the younger men he's hire recently 2 out of 3 don't last long.<br><br>Honestly we work very hard here. We supply a variety of industries, metal from 1/8th inch rods to steel bridge beams and ship almost a million pounds out a week out. The Collapse might be coming but we're not seeing it right now.<br><br>The couple of older men he has hired in this year don't seem to have a problem with the 48-55 hours a week and no air conditioning, sweat soaked clothing when you get home, dirty hands and such.<br><br>This of course means that the cost of those "meat automations" in medical bills will be higher.

There's many take aways from your narrative and it proves your ability as a writer to present such neatly packaged installments of this story that contain as much or more information between the lines as on the lines. Bravo!<br>I came to comment specifically on the last two installments where you boldy story how a return to older ways doesn't mean a return to the reigning beliefs at the time those ways were common: the marriage and the atheists. I actually perked up quite a bit when I read today's installment. As a "recovering christian" (self picked moniker there) I was relieved to see that in your future you allow for freedom of thought/belief and at least the ability for people to admit in public that they aren't a partaker in any established religion. Perhaps that means the government is also separate from the church both nominally and in practice. Or perhaps the gov and the church have learned to get along without trespassing over each others spheres of influence and do good together by then... I hope that the future is that kind.<br>I recently read a wonderful book of fiction and in the futuristic scenario presented, played out in a small corner of Ireland, the community had bigger fish to fry than nit pick about who believes what, they were trying to make ends meet afterall, till an enterprising jesus zealot and new priest looking for higher attendance got together and realized that the political scene (election was forthcoming to replace a retiring mayor) was ripe to pressure the locals into joining the church, if only only because the candidate they were backing was going to be in the pocket of the priest and thus wouldn't mayor in a fair and equitable fashion to those who weren't in the fold. I could see that scenario playing out all too easily and it was quite unsettling. The despite the velvet glove of "you want to be on god's side, because he will give good things to his children" the iron fist of their campaign was motivated completely by power grabbing and control. It was a thought provoking and disheartening read.<br>To the early commenter who was talking about technological advance and military..yes. The defense sector funds a LOT of research on advancing technology. However as someone else already stated - more advanced doesn't quate to 'guaranteed to win'. Technology advances seem to mean more complex interplay between things/people, and I am beginning to think that is almost always the wrong answer (unless it works seamlessly. And then it's like magic. But it usually doesn't.) But yet Complex integration of ways to send and receive data from/to various platforms in different locations is what our technology either is, or is demanding in order to keep it afloat. I oft find myself thinking that we are our own worst enemy...designing, funding and making things that won't be magical or terribly useful if their support system and energy sources go away.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-question-of-subsidies.html#c2417809779797776582 title="comment permalink">10/23/15, 4:00 PM</a><br><br>

In addition to my fellow commenters replies, I would add that the Atlantic Republic is an extrapolation of the current US, if/as we go on our current trajectory. A massive and bloated MIC is does not mean the most well funded and prepared military, ironically. Too much of the money/resources going into that cauldron are siphoned off, purposefully to the pockets of contractors, lobbyists, politicians and the military gets the F-35, (as discussed on earlier threads at length), $600 hammers and so on. It doesn't make the military stronger, but weaker. <br><br>As the Atlantic Republic has been described, their complexity and bloat /corruption at the top has them fairly well hamstrung from any real effective response. Not entirely sure they could even defend themselves against an invading enemy. <br><br>In relation to the US today, I think this is why we can and do do nothing against China's manmade island bases in the South Seas, why we will not directly take on Russia for intervening in Syria or Ukraine. AND military resources are also being siphoned off to militarize our domestic police forces, 'as if' the powers that be know there is likely to be a domestic insurrection. Crazy mess we're in, eh?<br><br>And only in addition to Unknown's comment on technology: JGM has said Lakeland has already put into place jammers, so Atlantic Republic's drones, GPS, and other electronic gizmos would not work there. <br><br>Having said all that - in some way, I think you're right - LLR, like every country, probably does need SOME form of military for defense against outside invasions. Perhaps they organize it like Israel; everyone of a certain age must serve their time in the military for 2-3 years.

South of the Shield, farming is good. On the Shield (it runs north pretty much to Hudson Bay, and west beyond today's Ontario) farming is difficult or impossible. On the Shield we have not the farms so prominent from train windows on the Toronto-Kingston-Montreal and Toronto-London-Windsor lines, but the dense forests so oppressive to the spirits of travellers on "Train One" out of Union Station to Sudbury and Sioux Lookout, headed for Vancouver. (This heavily forested terrain includes the "cottage country" to which Tyler August correctly refers.) So there may come a political fission, with the Shield lands no longer under the same jurisdiction as the south-of-Shield lands. <br><br>I would indeed now suggest that one possible evolution, whether by 2065 or in the longer term, sees the aboriginals obtain political supremacy on the Shield. The Shield lands are even today isolated. Their isolation will deepen as airlines and highways decline. This might strengthen the aboriginal political hand. Much is, admittedly, contingent in coming decades on the skill and self-confidence of the relevant aboriginal negotiators. <br><br>The present-day Ontario Sault Ste Marie is admittedly in the Upper Canada of 1791, as a kind of remote fringe domain at the very edge of the erstwhile colonial map. But being on the Shield, the terrain around Ontario Sault Ste Marie might find itself not in the Upper Canada of 2065. In 2065, physical geography, in particular the geography of agronomy (in an epoch of radical food insecurity) will play a role in determining political boundaries. <br><br>Whether or not the Michigan Sault Ste Marie abuts the Upper Canada of 2065 or not, JMG's words this week about trade with Upper Canada can stand without modification: the present-day Michigan Ste Marie, to which JMG refers, will indeed be conducting a vigorous trade with such essentially (very markedly off-Shield, very farming-secure) Upper-Canada centres as London, Windsor, Brantford, Toronto, and Kingston. Such a trade is <i>all</i> JMG is implying in the words he puts into the mouth of Peter Carr: "...and watched a brand new Mikkelson streetcar get hooked up to overhead power lines, tested one last time, and driven away on tracks to the siding where it would be loaded aboard a train and shipped to its destination - Sault Ste. Marie, Chu explained, which was expanding its streetcar system now that the borders were open and trade with Upper Canada had the local economy booming." <br><br><br>Tom<br><br><a href=retrotopia-question-of-subsidies.html#c4507778615683846895 title="comment permalink">10/23/15, 5:38 PM</a><br><br>

One of them included a parody of the then-recently-released film version of the musical "Camelot."<br><br>For some reason, instead of straightforwardly mocking the movie, the writers decided to rewrite it as a story about a modern (as of the late 60s) labor dispute. There was a preamble about how knights and wizards were no longer relevant (apologies to present company), but I suspect the real reason was to justify the awkward parody title "Can A Lot," as in "can" (fire or lay off) "a lot" of (many) employees. In any case, the result is that the piece is more a commentary on the labor disputes of its time than about the musical.<br><br>The plot is simple. The management (headed by the "Arthur" character) can't meet the demands of the labor union (headed by "Mordred"), so the laborers strike. (This is in part because the demands are objectively unreasonable; recall how crypto-reactionary MAD magazine has always been.) Arthur wants to "can the lot of them," but contract terms and labor laws don't permit it. The consultant ("Merlin," of course) gives Arthur an ingenious alternative, pointing out that the union members jobs are protected by law only as long as those jobs exist. Merlin and Arthur sing (to the tune of the original musical's title song "Camelot"):<br><br><i>They'll holler that your heart is black as onyx<br>But they cannot escape their awful fate<br>We'll just replace them all with electronics<br>And automate...</i><br><br>In the final panels, the workers have been replaced by stereotypically anthropomorphic robots, that themselves revolt and burn the factory down. No one wins, and no one looks good.<br><br>Okay, it would have been more prophetic if the robots had relocated themselves to Taiwan instead, but still, not bad for 1968. The real point of my bringing this up is to show that automation's destructive effect on labor's political power has always been fairly obvious, though rarely acknowledged.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-question-of-subsidies.html#c4347675764642284655 title="comment permalink">10/23/15, 8:45 PM</a><br><br>

As are your corrections to my spelling, which I must sheepishly admit. My statement was 'what we learn in schools,' however, which can be different from what occurred. Of course, I am constantly (and quite sick of) hearing how schools in the south are superior, so YMMV. History class might be more nuanced than 'Anglos came and oppressed the Natives, oppressed the French, and oppressed themselves. Also we beat the US twice, so Canada is amazing.' <br>I stand corrected re: Richmond Hill; and even were it still true, I should not have included that, regardless. That was low, and I apologize. I was already aware of your work with the Dunlap, and greatly respect you for it. Our difference is simply that you are a patriot of your country -- Upper Canada -- and I of mine, that Precambrian Shield you think of as desolate. I did live briefly in Upper Canada, however, and think it would be a fine little country if it kept to its own borders and found a way to keep the GTA from metastasizing. Probably a better little country than mine, by all rights, with more fertile soils, a more forgiving climate, and not riven by Franco-English rivalries and the shame of third-world-poor native communities. It's just not my country. But then, "Mon pays c'est pas un pays, c'est l'Hiver..."<br><br>(I would encourage you to take the Northlander up into the Nippising area and the Clay Belts, rather than Train One through Sudbury, to get a different picture of our agricultural potential, but you can't.

I ask because while it may be possible to assemble a streetcar using just human labor, I'd imagine some basic machinery including a foundry and tool &amp; die processes, among others, are required to actually make the parts even in the least automated factory.<br>How are wages and benefits guaranteed in Lakeland, considering the focus on workers over tech/automation? What are the laws on collective bargaining and organized labor? Are they allowed?<br>I was disappointed to see social security had survived in the Lakeland Republic. I was thinking back to your post regarding "the end of Retirement" of how we will return to older forms of elder care whereby elders are cared for in extended families in exchange for supporting the household economy. Considering how entitlements like Social Security and Medicare have allowed today's old people to abandon their collective responsibility to future generations, the sooner social security and other old age entitlements can be abandoned in favor of a general stipend to family members for elder care, the better. I'm surprised that social security still exists in Lakeland.<br>I'm hoping that the Atheists at the Lakeland Assemblies don't resemble the "Angry Atheists" you've skewered here on the blog in the past. I'm guessing that they resemble Agnostic spiritual seekers more than today's "Angry Atheists". I'm saying this because I don't see the gods that today's atheists worship (secular humanism, progress, Socialism, Bernie Sanders, international bodies/organizations, the US, materialism) coming out the other end of a Civil War and the unrest you've mentioned no worse for the wear.<br>Sorry to just now get back to you regarding county consolidation in KY. My guess is that like most things, it will come by fiscal necessity. Many of the rural counties, particularly in Appalachia, depend on federal funding, such as the ARC (Appalachian Regional Commission) to keep things funded. My guess is that most of these poorer counties will go bankrupt in a post Civil War KY, where the federal funding they depend on has dried up (since the Federal Government will, by definition, no longer exist). By necessity, they'll probably be consolidated until they achieve the necesary economy of scale to function on their own. The wealthy, urban counties like Jefferson (Louisville), Fayette (Lexington), Campbell (Covington), Kenton (Newport) may not suffer the same fate if they can afford to provide basic county government services without consolidation.<br>Off topic, but not really, I'm wondering if any other nation, in Holy Roman Empire fashion, will be interested in picking up the USA name after the Second Civil War makes the name available? I'm thinking Mexico (Estados Unidos Mexicanos/United Mexican States) would be a good candidate since they'll be the only united states left in North America, but maybe Brazil would want the name, too? They'd be united states of America, only in South America instead of North. I'm not sure if Argentina has states? Or Chile? Latin America never like they way US'ians refer to themselves as "Americans", anyway.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-question-of-subsidies.html#c6236098981618442967 title="comment permalink">10/24/15, 8:44 AM</a><br><br>

Of course one is not the other, but because you displayed your belief values previously, in the English language, you are caught out because you are trying to have the argument both ways and they are contradictory desires and thus the logic comes into conflict.<br><br>My understanding of JMG's story and worldview is that he believes that some atheists are every bit as rabid and dogmatic as religious fundamentalists and so he is stirring them up a bit with the story by pointing this fact out. You can watch atheists having an emotional response to such suggestions to see that his point of view is correct.<br><br>Seriously, if you disbelieve in a God or Gods then an atheist would simply say: "God, it's just this spirit, you know!" - and then go off and do something else and not think any more about it.

LLR may or may not have dry cleaners. A lot of woolens can be hand washed and lain flat to dry then steamed or lightly pressed back into shape. For tailored woolens, like suits, coats, trousers, etc. 1) they can be cleaned far less often than we are used to today. Washing and even dry cleaning breaks down the fibers, distorts the dye colors, shortening the life of the garments. <br>2) They can be spot cleaned as needed, or hung in a room with the window open for aerating, hung up in a bathroom for general steaming, or use a steam iron to get it back into proper shape. <br>But my favorite: 3) You can also spritz them with vodka, (an old theater costume trick) which absorbs odors, kills bacteria. Then air out, steam and shape to wear. Works wonders!<br><br>I think in the 'old days', they also wore more (easily washable) under-clothing, like slips, boxer shorts and such, protecting the wearer from itchy wool and protecting the wool from wearer's sweat. <br><br>Not saying you're implying this, but, I think super-frequent laundering is another late-20th C. thing we've been taught is an absolute must for decency or basic hygiene. Most of the time, clothes, (except underwear) don't need to be washed every day or after every wearing. We've just been taught that we're nasty and dirty if we don't.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-question-of-subsidies.html#c7962303422403453510 title="comment permalink">10/24/15, 8:05 PM</a><br><br>

This is at the root of Richmond Hill's David Dunlap Observatory conservation crisis, and is at the root of current difficulties a few kilometres farther north with the Oak Ridges Moraine, and more generally is at the root of current property-developer attempts to whittle away the GTA Greenbelt. It is particularly distressing that some of the land being threatened or destroyed is farming land of a high quality, liable to be valued once GTA's food supply becomes less secure. The GTA metastatization is a corroboration of James Howard Kunstler's critique of suburbia.<br> <br>For the benefit of readers outside Ontario, I will amplify a little on Tyler's illuminating remark regarding the Northlander. Until 2012, we had a nice passenger service, under the banner of the "Northlander" and "Polar Bear Express", taking people from Union Station in Toronto first to Cochrane, and then onward to Hudson Bay tidewater at Moosonee. In 2012, a large part of this service was axed, leaving only the Cochrane-Moosonee, i.e. the Polar Bear Express, run. Toronto-Cochrane passengers are now instead served by buses. Some sense of what has been lost can be had by searching Google Images under the string<br><br> <br> Gravenhurst station<br><br><br>I was hoping some day to take the trains from Union to Moosonee, but kept putting it off. This decision proves in retrospect unfortunate. <br><br><br>Tom <br><br>PS: Yes, the Soo (Yooper takes up this question): it would make sense for the Michigan and Ontario Soos to unite, and for them to unite under something other than the jurisdiction of Upper Canada. From a Toronto perspective, even the Ontario Soo seems remote - remote like Thunder Bay, Sudbury, Timmins, Cochrane, and Kenora, and in a different bioregion from Toronto's (centrally and paradigmatically Upper-Canadian) sister cities of Kingston, Hamilton, Kitchener-Waterloo, London, Brantford, Windsor, et al. Present-day Ontario is an artificial, bloated, political construct.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-question-of-subsidies.html#c332786892668586506 title="comment permalink">10/24/15, 8:46 PM</a><br><br>

Especially tailored outerwear. (Loose-fitting or draped wool outerwear, such as Roman togas, offered more options.) Some wool fabrics allow gentle rinsing with soap and water (without agitation in tubs or use of washboards), but it seems most had to make do with brushing, airing, and various means of scenting.<br><br>It appears that in many cultures in many time periods, including 19th century America prior to dry cleaning, wool suits and dresses weren't washed. I haven't found positive confirmation of that for suits, but I've read descriptions of high-quality wool dresses from mid 19th century America in museums, that examination showed had been long worn but never washed. Layers of washable linen undergarments were used to protect the outerwear fabric from within, and aprons and so forth protected from soiling from outside.<br><br>The tale about Abraham Lincoln getting a new suit dirty to rescue a mired pig gains significance (and loses plausibility by the same degree).<br><br>As best I can tell, a wool suit worn regularly by an urban Lakeland businessman, in the absence of dry cleaning, but well-tended otherwise with regular sun airing, brushing, and spot cleaning... would hardly be the reeking vermin-infested horror of biophobic fantasy, but it would tend to be a little funky.

If it is assembly only, then the place where the parts are produced must have excellent metrology (measurement) facilities, and the ability to quality control to better than 1/1000th inch. Either there is ONE base factory, with a self consistent set of standards, like Johanson blocks, micrometers, etc, or a set of factories with very strict quality standards indeed using a common set of standards. The subject of industrial metrology is little appreciated today outside of the industries that need them, but it is utterly vital if you are to have interchangable parts from different manufacturers. It is only since 1841 (Whitworth standard thread) that we have had such standards. In the case of a breakdown in civilisation, I fear we would loose much standardisation, and it would be difficult to regain such commonality. Even with careful standardisation of manufacture, there was a class of artisan called a 'fitter' in every organisation from steam traction works, to WWII aircraft squadron mechanics and later, who scraped, filed, sanded and polished not-quite-accurate-enough parts until they could be mashed together to make things work. I am really not sure that an assembly only factory would work unless the system could tolerate a rather high rejection/return rate of parts without 'fitting', and the necessary (potentially large) machines to do the same. An example would be the Crewe (UK) LMS engine works. I have seen archive film of the construction of a main-line loco from steel billits/sheets, through steam hammering of 16 foot piston rods (hand carried by gangs of men), turning of wheels on huge lathes, rolling of sheets of metal into boilers, etc. Thing is, all of the manufacture and assembly was done on one site, with a common set of standards. Thus all LMS locos of a class could interchange some parts (but even so, not all parts). The fate of interchangable parts in a declining mechanical age is uncertain.

The first thing that comes to mind would be a major release from either the Pickering or Darlington reactor complexes. Not exactly an appealing prospect. Fortunately, this does not exactly seem likely, given the safety record of the CANDU type, and the contentiousness and professionalism I have seen in the Canadian nuclear industry. <br><br>Thinking on it further, if Canada were to dissolve and (as is fairly widely acknowledged) Ontario is too large and unwieldy to govern-- perhaps the ex-province could enter into Confederation with itself? Canadians are more fond of government than those south of the border, and might very well see it as a positive to re-establish the middle tier, with the old provincial government becoming a new federal one, and new provinces being set up to take its place. Obviously Upper Canada would serve as one province, and by far the most populous and powerful. For the remainder, the easiest arrangement would be a spit into provinces of Northeastern and Northwestern Ontario; the former probably ruled from Greater Sudbury and the latter almost certainly from Thunder Bay. Those divisions already exist and are familiar to most, and so would quickly gain traction over more demographically (northern indigenous territories) or bioregionally (Clay Belt and Ottawa Watershed vs. rocky Precambrian shield) inspired divisions. I could also see Eastern Ontario splitting to form another province with the border near Kingston/Prince Edward County (sorry Thoomas) given the self-identity of the region, in spite of the historical ties with Upper Canada. I have seen even finer divisions proposed for the Upper Canada region (most of which start with splitting off Toronto as a city-province), but that somehow seems less likely.<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-question-of-subsidies.html#c8131160897138418722 title="comment permalink">10/25/15, 2:03 PM</a><br><br>

I"m not sure if you read JMG's post(s) regarding the end of retirement, but those of us Gen X or younger never expect to retire. We're already in JMG's post retirement cohort. The only hope for us to have a decent elderhood, which considering most of the upcoming crises about to wash over us, I'd say is not likely, but if we do make it to the old, old age of, say, 70, our only hope of a good old age is the social credit we've built up in our communities or with our families, that they'll be more than willing to look after us in exchange for teaching wisdom to the kids and helping with the household economy. You miss the point when you say younger generations would curtail all nonessential spending to save for their retirement years--one, most of us don't have any nonessential spending to cut, second, we don't expect to ever be able to retire in the first place, and last, most of us can't ever dream to live as long as today's Silents and Boomers once all the various crises wash over our society and take down life expectancy with them. Regarding dignity, who can deny that, but I do want to know where the bizarre idea that elders should be independent came from, other than the general obsession of independence in the US? It never was and is not now the case in many cultures that elders beyond their working years should be independent to the extent of living by themselves in a single family home. I think this bizarre belief that elder independence is an unmitigated good, and that depending on others is a torturous horror to be avoided at all costs, is something long overdue to be chucked into the compost bin. This belief has probably gone a long way in creating today's elders, who are perfectly content to cannibalize their children and grandchildren's future all so they can have some independent ideal that is downright bizarre (not to mention unsustainable) from a historical perspective.<br>Back to religion, or the lack thereof<br>I'm not sure I even believe in the existence of Atheists.

Maybe we'll get to go to a Christian service to see just how much it has changed from today's version as the Atheist Assembly?

Many households are reverting back to the multigenerational arrangements that were the norm for centuries, but the difference today is that the clout, wealth, and power lies with the old person instead of the working age person. They're the ones letting the poor, down and out and down on their luck young 'uns back into THEIR house, and it hasn't escaped notice of the younger generation who controls the purse strings and who has the clout. So, really, rather than independence, the issue is wealth and control. Since we're already back to multigenerational housing, the question then becomes, who should control the pursestrings from a societal perspective? What social arrangement is optimal for society? Is having all the wealth (and the power and control that comes with that) tied up with the elderly via pensions, investments, and entitlements optimal for society? Or is it best to value work and working and have wealth flow towards those able bodied people who can still work for income? Should unemployed kids and grandkids have to come cap in hand to their parents &amp; grandparents, or should it be the other way around? Keep in mind that we're well past the limits to growth now, and that the pie is shrinking, so ones profit is another's loss.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-question-of-subsidies.html#c6020077700888444344 title="comment permalink">10/25/15, 6:04 PM</a><br><br>

They were always there, it's just that I thought about them today. Apparently it takes quite a bit of energy to lift the water output from 500 or a 1000 houses. I wonder how many day's supply of diesel they have, if the grid goes down? <br><br>By the way, I notice that your narrator has encountered an old-fashioned phone.

This was long before JIT was developed.<br><br>For some reason the guy who machined cylinder heads stuck in my mind. He would take a cast blank, put it on his machine, things would whirr and move, cutting oil would spurt, and soon a cylinder head with bright and shiny machined surfaces would emerge. He then lifted the completed cylinder head off his machine and put it on a pallet behind him. There must have been close on a hundred machined cylinder heads on a couple of pallets waiting behind him to be mated with the engine block.<br><br>You might think this is a good thing. It breeds resilience. If his machine packs up or he's off sick, the factory can continue with what he's already machined.<br><br>But consider this: what if his machine is out of alignment and all hundred cylinder heads are defective? That means a hundred rework jobs. Far better to make one, use it, and if there's something wrong with it, fix the problem immediately to stop more defective parts being made. Minimize rework (and rework is wasted work).<br><br>Also, those hundred cylinder heads cost working capital to produce. Reducing work in progress can release substantial amounts of capital, plus save the interest expense to finance it. And of course it has to be stored somewhere. Reducing work in progress and inventory reduces the need for floor space, which reduces rent, lighting, maintenance, cleaning, etc etc.<br><br>Outside the Mini factory were hundreds and hundreds of Minis parked awaiting transport to the dealers. The problem is, they were parked next to a railway line in the hot African sun. The iron dust from the rails was settling on the paintwork, giving it a rusty patina, and the sun was perishing the rubber and plastic components. Apparently the dealers had to spend hundreds of Rands buffing and polishing and replacing parts to get the cars into salable condition, and the factory lost money on every Mini made.<br><br>Ideally with JIT, when you place your order, factories produce the one thing you have ordered, then stop until the next order arrives. Of course there are such things as economies of scale to consider, and a certain amount of safety stock is needed, but that's the ideal.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-question-of-subsidies.html#c3583055972316147868 title="comment permalink">10/26/15, 5:57 AM</a><br><br>

The elders would die at home, unencumbered by the fantastic expense of modern medicine. Now, in overdeveloped countries, many people do not marry, many of the married have no children, and those that have children generally have fewer of them. The demographics just don't work. In addition, the $100k+ spent in the last year of life to stave off death is totally unsustainable. <br><br>Instead of younger people saving every cent to support their parents and themselves, I think you'll see many couples having enough children to insure that they personally will be taken care of. One of the key controls to population growth is pensions. <br><br>Price controls on medical care won't work, IMHO. Price controls on gasoline in 1972 led to lines of idling cars stretching for blocks, trying to fill up their tanks. If high-tech medical care was really cheap, it would increase usage, not reduce it. And someone (us) would be paying for it somehow. Rationing by price, our current approach, doesn't work very well either. Rationing by restriction on procedures or pharmaceuticals would be a difficult trick to pull off in today's society. Pessimistically, I think we'll see rationing by price shift into high gear before long, where the elite get all the high-tech medical care they can dream of, and the rest of the society goes back to grandma dying quietly in the parlor, and children and young adults dying of infections and communicable diseases.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-question-of-subsidies.html#c4860755399362983075 title="comment permalink">10/26/15, 7:00 AM</a><br><br>

So, while your wages over time determine your Social Security payments, those payments do not come from your own wages, but from those of current workers.

Your suggestions seem realistic. I had not thought before of a confederation of provinces carved out of the former Ontario, but this indeed now seems to me to be the way to proceed. The envisaged arrangement has the advantage of perturbing our present set-up only moderately (in a situation which will in any case see us confronted with wrenching, traumatic change, notably in the former USA). <br><br>In particular, it does now seem to me that Kingston has a future as a major centre in a province distinct from the province that embeds Toronto. Kingston has a strong cultural tradition, going back to before the days of Sir John A. MacDonald, and is nowadays noted as the seat of a high-profile university. <br><br>One might perhaps go so far as to see Ottawa become the capital of the Ontario confederation. Ottawa, with all those fancy-schmancy buildings, does have to be used for <i>something</i> as the problematic future unfolds. <br><br>It might additionally prove possible to form some kind of loose cultural and customs union, beyond Ontario - a sort of "Communauté canadienne" in the spirit of the 1960s European Common Market, to save what can be saved from the present ocean-to-ocean Canadian confederation. The Communauté might help coordinate radio network broadcasting, Halifax-to-Vancouver passenger rail, and the like. <br><br>I would imagine the Communauté additionally doing what it can to coordinate the foreign policies of its members, in the face of potentially dangerous diplomatic developments from the former USA. Much can be done in diplomacy without formal treaties, but with a quiet understanding that when things get bad, all participating Foreign Ministries are to consult mutually, in a "communautaire" spirit. Such an approach would help in the event of. e.g., difficult trade talks with the Atlantic Republic. <br><br><br>Tom<br><br><a href=retrotopia-question-of-subsidies.html#c132888507042475556 title="comment permalink">10/26/15, 1:47 PM</a><br><br>

The harmonization of standards is a key task, and metrology an interesting subject. If civilization collapses, people must strive to preserve the legacy of the Bureau des poids et mésures (BIPM) in Paris. <br><br>It is a mild consolation here that of the seven or so fundamental SI-system (physics-lab) units, only (I think) the kilogram is now tied to an actual physical entity (the odious "standard kilogram", sitting in a jurisdiction not noted for its political stability). The metrologists are now on the verge of constructing a reproducible standard for the kilogram itself - something to do with assembling Avogadro's Number of some atoms of some appropriate isotope, or something along these lines - rather as they a few decades ago got a reproducible standard to replace the odious Parisian platinum-iridium(?) "standard metre" rod. <br><br>Chronometry, it might be worth adding, is now handled by BIPM's pooling the output of various atomic clocks around the world, I think at least one of them residing in Ottawa. The clocks diverge over periods of months on at least the nanosecond or microsecond scale, in their various ever-so-stable vaults, and BIPM takes something like an average. It is on the strength of this something-like-an-average that BIPM takes one key decision, every few years - the decision, namely, to insert a leap second into the year, so as to keep Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) at a conveniently small offset from the seconds counted off on the underlying atomic time scale. This aspect of metrology, including its prospects in civilizational collapse, I discuss, to a length of three or so paragraphs, in Chapter 2 of "Utopia 2184" (at www(dot)metascientia(dot)com). <br><br><br>Hastily,<br><br><br>Tom (at UTC=20151026T205747Z approx) <br><br>PS: The following cruel joke is said to circulate among military professionals: <i> How many French generals does it take to defend Paris?

I'm not certain that it's true, but it's certainly worth looking at more closely.<br><br>Actually "true" or "not true" isn't the way to frame it. It's a question of degree. Any code changes that shift the balance will have positive results; whether they can be sufficient to give full employment in the face of the exponential rise in computing capacity is another question. I've been assuming that we would have to somehow get away from the idea of "working for a living" entirely, and move into a world of humans as a privileged upper class, supported by an underclass of cheerful (because they're programmed so) robot slaves. But I've never liked that vision. I've seen enough of the idle rich, how they entertain themselves, and the games they get into to compete for status an power. That's not a healthy way for humans to live. It brings out the worst in people.<br><br>If retrotopia could be made to work naturally, it would be a vastly better solution. But I'm not sure that it can. Machines have advantages in productivity that go way beyond their ability to apply concentrated energy to a task. It's a myth that machines necessarily waste energy and win over manual labor only because they can draw on cheap energy from fossil fuels. Their real advantage is in speed and precision. A 5-axis numerically controlled milling machine is a marvel to behold. It would take really exorbitant taxes on computerized equipment before a room full of machinists with simple milling machines and lathes could compete with that one machine.

As a example, try to get a binding estimate on a surgery in most hospitals, they will refuse. This has been a requirement in the auto repair industry for years.The exceptions (http://surgerycenterok.com/)show that most procedures can be had for the amount of a typical co-pay, indicating that the person is actually the victim of a protection racket, where they pay the real cost out of pocket, and the "insurance" is just bankruptcy protection, much as the mafia charged for "fire insurance" so they wouldn't burn your place down. Reasonable estimates show that the price of medical care should be about 5-10% of GDP, not the 19-20% currently. The drug companies are equally to blame, where, with anything else, once you buy something, you own it. Drugs are only allowed to be possessed by the person who buys it first, with a permission slip. you can not resell it (legally)under any conditions (do you really own it then?)<br><br><a href=retrotopia-question-of-subsidies.html#c5593527845099436162 title="comment permalink">10/26/15, 8:07 PM</a><br><br>

People get confused about it. A lot of people think it's a thing in itself, while it's actually part of Lean Manufacturing, which has a lot of other pieces. You can't apply it, for example, before you've got all the variation squeezed out of the process. That presumes there is a process, which presumes that you're manufacturing enough units to make a process worth while.<br><br>You've also got the difference between mass production and bespoke production, and that's not as simple as one would think. An auto assembly plant, for example, works because it churns out thousands of cars a day, of several models and with a wide variety of "factory installed" options. I understand the auto industry would like nothing better than being able to get an order for a car with a specific set of options one day and have it roll off the line the next day, ready to ship to the customer. Right now, they can manage about a week, partly because they can't always line up the parts in their amazingly complex scheduling.<br><br>To get to the completely ridiculous other end, I have trouble imagining the assembly line that would put out, for example, aircraft carriers.<br><br>Non-mass production is similar. A number of years ago I saw an article on how G.E. builds jet engines. It's all manual labor. There isn't an assembly line. There's a crew of highly skilled mechanics who are working strictly to plan that put the engine together piece by piece. Partly that's because the mechanics in the field have to do exactly the same thing: there is nothing to be gained by attempting to automate it, and partly it's because there aren't enough of one part to make it worth setting up a mass production assembly line.<br><br>If you're working in a shop that does lots of special orders, you're either going to have a lot of manual labor, or the people doing the ordering are going to have to submit the plans in form for the automated tools.<br><br>The streetcar plant we saw was almost certainly doing Henry Ford assembly: you can have any color as long as it's black.

These sub-assemblies are ordered so that they arrive just in time to be slotted into a particular run of product. <br>This kind of JIT does not apply to one-off/limited production runs in small shops where most of the product is made "in house," since in that case pretty much everything is made JIT anyway as part of the manufacturing process itself.<br>JIT is also used by many large companies which supply spare parts for their products, to avoid having to hold a large inventory of thouseands of different spares (inventory capital tied up + insurance + a storage space, ect).<br>Other companies just don't provide spares at all; so when even the simplest part of a product breaks, the "consumer" just has to bin the whole thing and buy a new unit.<br>When judiciously used AND working smoothly, JIT can help make the manufacturing process "leaner and meaner", but when it involves long/complex supply lines from say China or Germany to say, New Zealand, there is the possibility of disruption due to all sorts of external factors such as political instability, weather, volcanic dust clouds killing jet engines, unforseen currency exchange movements, to name a few.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-question-of-subsidies.html#c4901736751931048307 title="comment permalink">10/27/15, 10:00 PM</a><br><br>

What one person proclaims as "God's Law" can just as well be regarded as norms of the community which have been anonymized and stabilized by attributing them to the ancient words of a supernatural being. <br><br>There is statistical evidence that people who describe themselves as members of a faith community have better life outcomes than those who do not (see Wikipedia: "Happiness/Religion and Happiness"). An objective observation is not invalidated by disputes over the mechanism by which it is produced. I've read that there's a dramatic moment in the theatrical production "Book of Mormon", in which a character says "If Mormons have happy families in cohesive communities, does it matter if the dogma is absurd?"<br><br>Is there a label which one can adopt which denotes "I believe that stable, cohesive communities of kindness toward one's neighbors and family are worth devoting my personal resources to support" other than the traditionally religious? People of faith may not always (or even "often") live up to their ideals, but at least they have shared ideals. When an individual seeks to "do good" for a person in need, social complications result from the exposure of inequality, and expectations or obligations for reciprocity. When a church can broker charity, it creates a useful isolation between those with resources to share, and those in need which allows charity to be accepted for the good of the community. Such a charitable organization can develop institutional awareness to distinguish "the deserving poor" from the opportunists, and can redirect those in need to specialized support (e.g., substance-abuse treatment, other medical care, subsidized housing, etc.).<br><br>In short, irrational believers can produce positive social outcomes.

<div class="avtb a_b8bf64" id=c7671666464964241774></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/04738098262290972899 rel=nofollow>August Johnson</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>@Josh - I've seen that article and many others like it about building so-called "low-tech" versions of the Internet. I have to say I don't see this as really "low-tech" but rather "low-budget". After all, the actual technology used in these networks isn't any lower tech than that used in today's "high-tech" internet, just smaller and not capable of as high speeds.<br><br>When the Internet gets priced out of most people's reach, these smaller devices will suffer the same fate, the reason they're priced the way they are is because they're used to support the existing Internet. Yes, we'll be able to use scrounged devices to build less fancy internets, but I don't think it's fair to call it "low-tech" when it takes the same multi-million dollar factories and supply lines to produce the parts. Just think what it actually takes to build a "simple" LinkSys router/gateway and then try to imagine doing it under the restrictions JMG has laid out in these posts.<br><br>Near the very end they start talking about "data mules" and "sneakernets". Very familiar terms to me, back in the 1970's and the days of sneakernets, we had a saying "Never underestimate the bandwidth of a station wagon full of magnetic tapes." However, they're still using them to support the very same high-tech end uses, email, distributing movies and music files. This requires the same high-tech equipment at the ends as today's Internet does. I don't think you'll find hard drives or computers in the Lakeland Republic.<br><br>Remember, that even back pre-1920, Radio Amateurs had a functioning network that was passing traffic coast to coast in the US, with only the "infrastructure" of individual amateur's personal homebuilt radios. Even by 1930's standards these were considered primitive but they worked. We don't need all that high-tech WiFi equipment to have a low-tech Internet! I wish more people would see the utility of Ham Radio!<br><br>I know this example is at the extreme "primitive" end of radio technology, but I want to use it to demonstrate true low-tech electronic distance communications.<br><br><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=0eYEAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Wireless+Telegraphy+and+High+Frequency+Electricity:&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAGoVChMI7azCttnlyAIVCcJjCh0DoQ2C#v=onepage&amp;q=Wireless%20Telegraphy%20and%20High%20Frequency%20Electricity%3A&amp;f=false" rel=nofollow>Wireless Telegraphy and High Frequency Electricity</a> (1909)<br>From Google Books - How to build your wireless station<br><br><a href=retrotopia-question-of-subsidies.html#c7671666464964241774 title="comment permalink">10/28/15, 10:37 AM</a><br><br>

He started as a grunt, hunched over, hammering barnacles off ship bottoms while they were in dry dock (try that 10 hours a day if you want to know what real work is like). His supervisor realized my dad was a bright spark who had got top grades in drafting (by hand of course) and woodworking in high school, so he was promted to the lofting department. There he lofted (scaled up from blueprints) and made full sized wood patterns. The patterns, complete with hundreds of holes where rivets would go, were used to mark out the 1,000's of steel plates that make up a ship. Some were Liberty Ships, one was a hospital ship. So yes, there was LOTS of hand work then. And it was pretty much an "assembly line" process.<br>Towards the end of the war, my dad got head-hunted by Northrup Aircraft to loft their experimental B-35 Flying Wing Bomber. It was basically just one huge 172ft wing with 4 prop engines facing aft. This was an example of a very limited production run, I think only 3 were actually built. Dad first worked on the 1/3 scale prototype.<br>End of story: my dad used his lofting/design/woodworking skills in the post war economic boom to start a successful furniture business employing 42 people at its height in the 60's. Thanks Dad for passing those skills to me!<br><br><a href=retrotopia-question-of-subsidies.html#c3912873327734609073 title="comment permalink">10/28/15, 10:46 PM</a><br><br>

I don't know about where you live, but I am seeing the infrastructure near me in disrepair and decline. Proper maintenance requires capital we don't have as well as energy and resources we cannot afford. The natural tendency is to try to keep everything operating, but that is likely to lead to tipping points resulting in spiraling decline. We really to need to consider which technologies can realistically be of value to a nation in decline. Think a lower speed Internet that can provide information, simple communication and support for commerce, but is not robust enough for streaming video and on-line gaming by way of example. Or highways that are adequate for a 50 mph speed limit, like an interstate highway reduces to northbound lanes while the south bound lanes have been converted to rail. Or, the end of landlines for cable and telephone eliminated in favor of cheaper and easier to maintain cellular systems. The idea of a lower tier infrastructure doesn't need to be limited to a nominal year, but to what can continue to be used at a reasonable cost.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-question-of-subsidies.html#c4259818114356552471 title="comment permalink">11/24/15, 8:17 PM</a><br><br>
