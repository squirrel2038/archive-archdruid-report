I've commented more than once in these essays about the cooperative dimension of writing:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the way that even the most solitary of writers inevitably takes part in what Mortimer Adler used to call the Great Conversation, the flow of ideas and insights across the centuries that’s responsible for most of what we call culture. Sometimes that conversation takes place second- or third-hand—for example, when ideas from two old books collide in an author’s mind and give rise to a third book, which will eventually carry the fusion to someone else further down the stream of time—but sometimes it’s far more direct. </div>

<div class=MsoNormal>
Last week’s post here brought an example of the latter kind. My attempt to cut through the ambiguities surrounding that slippery word “progress” sparked a lively discussion on the comments page of my blog about just exactly what counted as progress, what factors made one change “progressive” while another was denied that label. In the midst of it all, one of my readers—tip of the archdruidical hat to Jonathan—proposed an unexpected definition:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>what makes a change qualify as progress, he suggested, is that it increases the externalization of costs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’ve been thinking about that definition since Jonathan proposed it, and it seems to me that it points up a crucial and mostly unrecognized dimension of the crisis of our time. To make sense of it, though, it’s going to be necessary to delve briefly into economic jargon. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Economists use the term “externalities” to refer to the costs of an economic activity that aren’t paid by either party in an exchange, but are pushed off onto somebody else. You won’t hear a lot of talk about externalities these days; it many circles, it’s considered impolite to mention them, but they’re a pervasive presence in contemporary life, and play a very large role in some of the most intractable problems of our age. Some of those problems were discussed by Garret Hardin in his famous essay on the tragedy of the commons, and more recently by Elinor Ostrom in her studies of how that tragedy can be avoided; still, I’m not sure how often it’s recognized that the phenomena they discussed applies not just to commons systems, but to societies as a whole—especially to societies like ours. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>

<div class=MsoNormal>
An example may be useful here. Let’s imagine a blivet factory, which turns out three-prong, two-slot blivets in pallet loads for customers. The blivet-making process, like manufacturing of every other kind, produces waste as well as blivets, and we’ll assume for the sake of the example that blivet waste is moderately toxic and causes health problems in people who ingest it. The blivet factory produces one barrel of blivet waste for every pallet load of blivets it ships. The cheapest option for dealing with the waste, and thus the option that economists favor, is to dump it into the river that flows past the factory. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Notice what happens as a result of this choice. The blivet manufacturer has maximized his own benefit from the manufacturing process, by avoiding the expense of finding some other way to deal with all those barrels of blivet waste. His customers also benefit, because blivets cost less than they would if the cost of waste disposal was factored into the price. On the other hand, the costs of dealing with the blivet waste don’t vanish like so much twinkle dust; they are imposed on the people downstream who get their drinking water from the river, or from aquifers that receive water from the river, and who suffer from health problems because there’s blivet waste in their water. The blivet manufacturer is externalizing the cost of waste disposal; his increased profits are being paid for at a remove by the increased health care costs of everyone downstream. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s how externalities work. Back in the days when people actually talked about the downsides of economic growth, there was a lot of discussion of how to handle externalities, and not just on the leftward end of the spectrum.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I recall a thoughtful book titled <i>TANSTAAFL</i>—that’s an acronym, for those who don’t know their Heinlein, for “There Ain’t No Such Thing As A Free Lunch”—which argued, on solid libertarian-conservative grounds, that the environment could best be preserved by making sure that everyone paid full sticker price for the externalities they generated. Today’s crop of pseudoconservatives, of course, turned their back on all this a long time ago, and insist at the top of their lungs on their allegedly God-given right to externalize as many costs as they possibly can.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is all the more ironic in that most pseudoconservatives claim to worship a God who said some very specific things about “what ye do to the least of these,” but that’s a subject for a different post.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Economic life in the industrial world these days can be described, without too much inaccuracy, as an arrangement set up to allow a privileged minority to externalize nearly all their costs onto the rest of society while pocketing as much as possible the benefits themselves. That’s come in for a certain amount of discussion in recent years, but I’m not sure how many of the people who’ve participated in those discussions have given any thought to the role that technological progress plays in facilitating the internalization of benefits and the externalization of costs that drive today’s increasingly inegalitarian societies. Here again, an example will be helpful. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Before the invention of blivet-making machinery, let’s say, blivets were made by old-fashioned blivet makers, who hammered them out on iron blivet anvils in shops that were to be found in every town and village. Like other handicrafts, blivet-making was a living rather than a ticket to wealth; blivet makers invested their own time and muscular effort in their craft, and turned out enough in the way of blivets to meet the demand. Notice also the effect on the production of blivet waste. Since blivets were being made one at a time rather than in pallet loads, the total amount of waste was smaller; the conditions of handicraft production also meant that blivet makers and their families were more likely to be exposed to the blivet waste than anyone else, and so had an incentive to invest the extra effort and expense to dispose of it properly. Since blivet makers were ordinary craftspeople rather than millionaires, furthermore, they weren’t as likely to be able to buy exemption from local health laws. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=separator style="clear: both; text-align: center">
<a href=../../img/impossiblefork-c1d206-g95.jpg style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img border=0 height=160 src=../../img/impossiblefork-c1d206-200x160-g95.jpg srcset="../../img/impossiblefork-c1d206-340x272-g92.jpg 1.7x" width=200></a></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The invention of the mechanical blivet press changed that picture completely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since one blivet press could do as much work as fifty blivet makers, the income that would have gone to those fifty blivet makers and their families went instead to one factory owner and his stockholders, with as small a share as possible set aside for the wage laborers who operate the blivet press. The factory owner and stockholders had no incentive to pay for the proper disposal of the blivet waste, either—quite the contrary, since having to meet the disposal costs cut into their profit, buying off local governments was much cheaper, and if the harmful effects of blivet waste were known, you can bet that the owner and shareholders all lived well upstream from the factory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Notice also that a blivet manufacturer who paid a living wage to his workers and covered the costs of proper waste disposal would have to charge a higher price for blivets than one who did neither, and thus would be driven out of business by his more ruthless competitor. Externalities aren’t simply made possible by technological progress, in other words; they’re the inevitable result of technological progress in a market economy, because externalizing the costs of production is in most cases the most effective way to outcompete rival firms, and the firm that succeeds in externalizing the largest share of its costs is the most likely to prosper and survive. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Each further step in the progress of blivet manufacturing, in turn, tightened the same screw another turn. Today, to finish up the metaphor, the entire global supply of blivets is made in a dozen factories in<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>distant Slobbovia, where sweatshop labor under ghastly working conditions and the utter absence of environmental regulations make the business of blivet fabrication more profitable than anywhere else. The blivets are as shoddily made as possible; the entire blivet supply chain from the open-pit mines worked by slave labor that provide the raw materials to the big box stores with part-time, poorly paid staff selling blivetronic technology to the masses is a human and environmental disaster.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Every possible cost has been externalized, so that the two multinational corporations that dominate the global blivet industry can maintain their profit margins and pay absurdly high salaries to their CEOs. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That in itself is bad enough, but let’s broaden the focus to include the whole systems in which blivet fabrication takes place: the economy as a whole, society as a whole, and the biosphere as a whole. The impact of technology on blivet fabrication in a market economy has predictable and well understood consequences for each of these whole systems, which can be summed up precisely in the language we’ve already used. In order to maximize its own profitability and return on shareholder investment, the blivet industry externalizes costs in every available direction. Since nobody else wants to bear those costs, either, most of them end up being passed onto the whole systems just named, because the economy, society, and the biosphere have no voice in today’s economic decisions. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Like the costs of dealing with blivet waste, though, the other externalized costs of blivet manufacture don’t go away just because they’re externalized. As externalities increase, they tend to degrade the whole systems onto which they’re dumped—the economy, society, and the biosphere. This is where the trap closes tight, because blivet manufacturing exists within those whole systems, and can’t be carried out unless all three systems are sufficiently intact to function in their usual way. As those systems degrade, their ability to function degrades also, and eventually one or more of them breaks down—the economy plunges into a depression, the society disintegrates into anarchy or totalitarianism, the biosphere shifts abruptly into a new mode that lacks adequate rainfall for crops—and the manufacture of blivets stops because the whole system that once supported it has stopped doing so. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Notice how this works out from the perspective of someone who’s benefiting from the externalization of costs by the blivet industry—the executives and stockholders in a blivet corporation, let’s say. As far as they’re concerned, until very late in the process, everything is fine and dandy: each new round of technological improvements in blivet fabrication increases their profits, and if each such step in the onward march of progress also means that working class jobs are eliminated or offshored, democratic institutions implode, toxic waste builds up in the food chain, or what have you, hey, that’s not their problem—and after all, that’s just the normal creative destruction of capitalism, right? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That sort of insouciance is easy for at least three reasons. First, the impacts of externalities on whole systems can pop up a very long way from the blivet factories.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Second, in a market economy, everyone else is externalizing their costs as enthusiastically as the blivet industry, and so it’s easy for blivet manufacturers (and everyone else) to insist that whatever’s going wrong is not their fault.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Third, and most crucially, whole systems as stable and enduring as economies, societies, and biospheres can absorb a lot of damage before they tip over into instability. The process of externalization of costs can thus run for a very long time, and become entrenched as a basic economic habit, long before it becomes clear to anyone that continuing along the same route is a recipe for disaster. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Even when externalized costs have begun to take a visible toll on the economy, society, and the biosphere, furthermore, any attempt to reverse course faces nearly insurmountable obstacles. Those who profit from the existing order of things can be counted on to fight tooth and nail for the right to keep externalizing their costs: after all, they have to pay the full price for any reduction in their ability to externalize costs, while the benefits created by not imposing those costs on whole systems are shared among all participants in the economy, society, and the biosphere respectively. Nor is it necessarily easy to trace back the causes of any given whole-system disruption to specific externalities benefiting specific people or industries. It’s rather like loading hanging weights onto a chain; sooner or later, as the amount of weight hung on the chain goes up, the chain is going to break, but the link that breaks may be far from the last weight that pushed things over the edge, and every other weight on<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the chain made its own contribution to the end result</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A society that’s approaching collapse because too many externalized costs have been loaded onto on the whole systems that support it thus shows certain highly distinctive symptoms. Things are going wrong with the economy, society, and the biosphere, but nobody seems to be able to figure out why; the measurements economists use to determine prosperity show contradictory results, with those that measure the profitability of individual corporations and industries giving much better readings those that measure the performance of whole systems; the rich are convinced that everything is fine, while outside the narrowing circles of wealth and privilege, people talk in low voices about the rising spiral of problems that beset them from every side. If this doesn’t sound familiar to you, dear reader, you probably need to get out more. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
At this point it may be helpful to sum up the argument I’ve developed here:</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
a) Every increase in technological complexity tends also to increase the opportunities for externalizing the costs of economic activity;</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
b) Market forces make the externalization of costs mandatory rather than optional, since economic actors that fail to externalize costs will tend to be outcompeted by those that do;</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
c) In a market economy, as all economic actors attempt to externalize as many costs as possible, externalized costs will tend to be passed on preferentially and progressively to whole systems such as the economy, society, and the biosphere, which provide necessary support for economic activity but have no voice in economic decisions;</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
d) Given unlimited increases in technological complexity, there is no necessary limit to the loading of externalized costs onto whole systems short of systemic collapse;</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
e) Unlimited increases in technological complexity in a market economy thus necessarily lead to the progressive degradation of the whole systems that support economic activity;</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
f) Technological progress in a market economy<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>is therefore self-terminating, and ends in collapse. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course there are plenty of arguments that could be deployed against this modest proposal. For example, it could be argued that progress doesn’t have to generate a rising tide of externalities. The difficulty with this argument is that externalization of costs isn’t an accidental side effect of technology but an essential aspect—it’s not a bug, it’s a feature. Every technology is a means of externalizing some cost that would otherwise be borne by a human body. Even something as simple as a hammer takes the wear and tear that would otherwise affect the heel of your hand, let’s say, and transfers it to something else: directly, to the hammer; indirectly, to the biosphere, by way of the trees that had to be cut down to make the charcoal to smelt the iron, the plants that were shoveled aside to get the ore, and so on. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For reasons that are ultimately thermodynamic in nature, the more complex a technology becomes, the more costs it generates. In order to outcompete a simpler technology, each more complex technology has to externalize a significant proportion of its additional costs, in order to compete against the simpler technology. In the case of such contemporary hypercomplex technosystems as the internet, the process of externalizing costs has gone so far, through so many tangled interrelationships, that it’s remarkably difficult to figure out exactly who’s paying for how much of the gargantuan inputs needed to keep the thing running. This lack of transparency feeds the illusion that large systems are cheaper than small ones, by making externalities of scale look like economies of scale. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It might be argued instead that a sufficiently stringent regulatory environment, forcing economic actors to absorb all the costs of their activities instead of externalizing them onto others, would be able to stop the degradation of whole systems while still allowing technological progress to continue. The difficulty here is that increased externalization of costs is what makes progress profitable. As just noted, all other things being equal, a complex technology will on average be more expensive in real terms than a simpler technology, for the simple fact that each additional increment of complexity has to be paid for by an investment of energy and other forms of real capital. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Strip complex technologies of the subsidies that transfer some of their costs to the government, the perverse regulations that transfer some of their costs to the rest of the economy, the bad habits of environmental abuse and neglect that transfer some of their costs to the biosphere, and so on, and pretty soon you’re looking at hard economic limits to technological complexity, as people forced to pay the full sticker price for complex technologies maximize their benefits by choosing simpler, more affordable options instead. A regulatory environment sufficiently strict to keep technology from accelerating to collapse would thus bring technological progress to a halt by making it unprofitable. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=separator style="clear: both; text-align: center">
<a href=../../img/rogerhaywardundecidable-monume-5f84f6-g95.jpg style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img border=0 height=200 src=../../img/rogerhaywardundecidable-monume-5f84f6-160x200-g95.jpg srcset="../../img/rogerhaywardundecidable-monume-5f84f6-320x400-g92.jpg 2x" width=160></a></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Notice, however, the flipside of the same argument: a society that chose to stop progressing technologically could maintain itself indefinitely, so long as its technologies weren’t dependent on nonrenewable resources or the like. The costs imposed by a stable technology on the economy, society, and the biosphere would be more or less stable, rather than increasing over time, and it would therefore be much easier to figure out how to balance out the negative effects of those externalities and maintain the whole system in a steady state.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Societies that treated technological progress as an option rather than a requirement, and recognized the downsides to increasing complexity, could also choose to reduce complexity in one area in order to increase it in another, and so on—or they could just raise a monument to the age of progress, and go do something else instead. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
The logic suggested here requires a comprehensive rethinking of most of the contemporary world’s notions about technology, progress, and the good society. We’ll begin that discussion in future posts—after, that is, we discuss a second dimension of progress that came out of last week’s discussion. </div>

It sounds very boring, but in fact impacts many of us. This activity appears to be undertaken by big business to avoid paying taxes on company profits. My understanding of the process, and I could be incorrect in this understanding, is that a local company owns another company in a country which has low company tax rates such as Singapore or Switzerland for example. The Singapore or Switzerland based related company then apparently loans money to the local company and charges interest to that local company (or charges a royalty or management fee). Those expenses then pretty much eliminate local company profits and effectively ship them offshore and then those local companies don’t pay much – if any – company taxes. Talk about externalising costs of doing business onto the general public.<br><br><a href=http://www.smh.com.au/business/tax-haven-explosion-puts-hole-in-corporate-tax-20150213-13dnh8.html rel=nofollow>Tax haven explosion puts hole in corporate tax</a> <br><br>It is not until you realise the size of this apparent swindle is twice that in dollars terms of all the “real world” trade between Australia and China in 2012 and who knows what it amounts to now!<br><br>It was at about that point that realisation dawned on me and perhaps I’m drawing the wrong conclusion, but even so, common sense says that perhaps those companies are not actually financially viable in their present circumstances had they actually had to pay company tax? I don’t actually know the answer to this question, however, it strikes me as a common sense conclusion to draw because, the returns aren’t actually being seen in the markets. Sure, companies are paying dividends, many people are being paid as employees well above their actual worth and some people are getting wildly rich, but there isn’t as much of that going on as the sheer volume of the “international related party dealings” would lead a person to expect. So many people rely these days on income from investments that perhaps we have now tipped into unsustainable territory for that sort of income and what can’t be sustained, usually isn’t!<br><br>Dunno, but it isn’t good…<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br>PS: I've got a new blog up <a href=http://ferngladefarm.blogspot.com.au/ rel=nofollow>Chookflation</a> discussing the increasing cost of purchasing chickens, chicken wars, spiders, cyclones and adapting to hot weather.

Apparently, the Post Office, that used to just put air mail on the nearest plane and off to its destination, has contracted with Fed Ex, which by rule sends all parcels through its hub in Memphis, no matter where they come from. These past weeks have been cold in Memphis, planes have been delayed, and besides, shipping live chicks (food and waterless, of course) through an extra flight or two has resulted in ...externalities. :-( The owner is really upset, and especially frustrated because there seems to be no alternative to the gargantuan shipping companies - none that would allow him to sell the chicks at a decent cost. He says he's gonna try once again this week and then find another supply.

Certainly CEOs (in his view) need excellent skill sets but there are sufficient candidates with the necessary skills to meet demand at much lower salaries. Hartman's thesis is that in order to maximize profit at any cost (externalize) with no empathy or compassion for those adversely affected requires a successful CEO to also be a sociopath. Since sociopaths are only about 2% of the population, there is now a small supply of candidates with the required skills and psychology. There are just not that many Jack Welshs around and the market price goes up.

When the straightforward solution would be for some source of authority to simply say, "Stop doing that," those market actors who have an interest in keeping the activity going, teamed with a consumption-obsessed customer base and the propaganda firepower to generate the demand, will almost always have enough influence to deflect regulation to a form they can fob off onto someone else.

It is obvious of course the cost its preferred way of life have on it's environment as many kinds of life are sensitive to the byproducts it releases, those spores can be nasty. But I was seeing a different angle to it, the mold was taking a lifeless, some would say uninhabitable, surface devoid of natural resources except in trace amounts from air born dust and moisture from the shower, and colonizing it. The rough surface of the mold helped its local community store water between the showers, and its biological byproducts found hungry membranes to be absorbed by. If not for my apocalyptic intervention it would have carried on decomposing what ever waste came it's way, and building up more complicated organic molecules, until the room got so nasty that human efforts to clean it would be defeated and the microbes could carry forward turning a barren surface into a life support center.<br><br>On one level the mold was externalizing cost, and eventually those costs came back to it with an ample helping of apple cider vinegar to boot. On another level it was part of a cycle which turns lifeless mineral surfaces into life supporting little ecosystems. It added alot of complexity to that lifeless polished polymer, but there were consumers for all of its products! Even the nasty spores are a tasty meal to some microbes who help keep the mold in check. <br><br>Recently energy density stacked the deck very strongly toward industrialism, because the energy needs complicated ways of following it's bliss, and the machine needs power to over whelm their competition. Still I wonder about the theme that after past societies did their dance of building up and tearing down complexity, some technologies that survived were more complex than what existed before, and the survivors were exactly those which could survive shrinking back down, at least part of the way, to the craft scale.<br><br>All of this is tied together for me personally because I have started exploring mycology as a little cottage scale business. The big industrial mushroom farms have very fancy technology and can do amazing things. Home growing is very simple and cheap, with the right education everyone could grow their own as easily as they could keep chickens or make their own pickles (from seed), the scale is small but that is good because mushrooms are not keen on large distribution anyway. Tonight I am still working with the pressure cookers, and they are nearly done cooking to make another 20 pounds of inoculated grain. Interestingly cardboard is one of the most important tools for low tech mushroom cultivation, it is the most high tech bottle neck in the style of growing I am following, but I hope a more basic alternative can be found.<br><br>This all somehow reminds me of an idea inspired by Bateson that senescence is caused by the organism learning and adapting itself into a corner, until it needs a hard reboot through the process of generation.<br><br><br><br><a href=the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html#c2036346051757654703 title="comment permalink">2/25/15, 8:32 PM</a><br><br>

A few points have occured to me as I've read through this post.<br><br>First of all, Jonathan's definition, - "what makes a change qualify as progress, he suggested, is that it increases the externalization of costs"<br><br>When you consider the peak oiler's maxim of "borrowing from the future", doesn't it make sense that Externalisation means the temporal as well as the immediate physical?<br><br>Secondly, I'm in the position (really) of (the equivalent of) expert blivet maker. I've put my price for blivets up to the upper end of what the market will support, but I'm working sixty hours a week at my blivet press, yet the orders keep comng in. I haven't had a real holday for 3 years. I'm now looking at franchising. Getting others to make blivets to my high specification, and to somehow take a cut. It's taken me a decade or more to establish my reputation, and while demand for blivets is high, why shouldn't I take advantage of the opportunity to earn the same or a bit more money, but spend a bit more time doing something other than manning a blivet press?<br><br>I'm not saying it's right or moral or anything, but I'm sick and tired of slogging my bollocks off for 60 hours a week, and if I can get other people to give me money, for offloading some of that demand, well, I'd be a fool not to, no?<br><br><br><br>Thrirdly, Have you read Robert Tressell's "The ragged Trousered Philanthropists"? You've pretty much provided an abstract, in a few brief paragraphs, of what took an entire novel of classic utopian English novel to say. Paragraph eleven is pretty much taken verbatim from it.<br><br><br><br>And that's also where I got to tonight before I had to finish my post. I have to work tomorrow.

I can see the problem. I don't want to be party to the injustice of it. Yet it permeates every area of my life. Everything that makes my life work as an average, clueless suburbanite, is a blivet.<br>I am taking tiny baby steps away from the Machine, but the project seems overwhelming. It also makes me very angry that I have been put in a position where everything I own or use, the whole fabric of the society I live in, comes at the expense of misery for someone else, or is wrecking some bit of planet I can't see.<br>I feel like King Midas - I am an incredibly privileged member of an elite society, yet everything I touch has likely already killed somebody.<br>The baby steps I have taken so far - trying not buy new, growing some food, searching for local products, making my own - well, it's a start, but will take a long while to finesse.<br>So tell us Archdruid, what is your response to the immensity of this issue? Is there something I am missing? Do we opt out completely? Create an alternative society?

As a small scale hand made blivet maker myself (farmer), I can say easily that large scale corporate blivet makers achieve a much lower amount of waste (internalized or externalized) per blivet than your hand maker of blivets. A person cannot compete in terms of efficiency with a machine. The large system creates more waste because many of those blivets produced at the alter of progress are either wasted altogether (like some 40% of industrially produced food) or not needed and marketed into the hands of the public (like what to do with excess manufacturing capacity after WWII). The greatest signifier of progress in my mind is the paradigm of maximum production above all other concerns.

Ernest Thompson Seton's advice is always worth remembering: "Do what you can with what you have, where you are, right now." <br><br>Mark, if I may quote myself: <br><br>"a) Every increase in technological complexity tends also to increase the opportunities for externalizing the costs of economic activity"<br><br>Please note the word "tends." That doesn't mean it happens in every case; that means it happens rather more often than not, and so citing specific examples where it doesn't happen doesn't undercut the argument. Of course we can also talk about the whole system cost of natural gas production, electronics component manufacture, etc., which also have to be included in the equation...<br><br>Mister R., no argument there!<br><br>Onething, exactly. I was delighted to see so many other people catching on to the same thing I was getting. <br><br>YCS, I know; I disagree with him. Historically, societies don't collapse that way, and my theory of catabolic collapse explains why: societies in crisis slash costs and cannibalize capital to keep going, and these measures work at least for a time to bring things back into balance. That's what produces the stairstep decline that real societies in real history undergo. <br><br>Kutamun, it occasionally happens that a society chooses reduced complexity as a way to survive, but it's not common. Our civilization made the other choice, and is well on its way into the predictable consequences.<br><br>Timothy, excellent! Yes, that's exactly the sort of thing I'm talking about. <br><br>Hector, yes, I expected that sort of rhetorical strategy. You might want to start by rereading the place where I said that "every increase in technological complexity <b>tends</b> also to increase the opportunities for externalizing the costs of economic activity" -- emphasis added. You might then want to consider that pulling examples out of context and ignoring their whole system impacts, when it's the whole system impacts I'm discussing, is arguably not the most valid form of argument. Is a sewage system really a source of anti-externalities? How much CO2 is produced in manufacturing its concrete? What about the ecological cost of keeping it supplied with chlorine? Etc., etc., etc. -- the more complex the technology, the more costs are involves, and it's precisely the unwillingness to trace those costs all the way out that helps drive the situation I discussed in this week's post.<br><br><a href=the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html#c261804172551387352 title="comment permalink">2/25/15, 10:03 PM</a><br><br>

Industrial production isn't actually any more efficient, except for very nuanced values of that slippery word "efficient" -- the industrial system is just much, much better at pushing its costs off onto other people, the economy, society, and the biosphere. It's always easy to look more efficient when someone else is surreptitiously paying your bills, and their input isn't being included in cost-benefit statements! <br><br>Taraxacum, I've long admired Garret Hardin's insistence that when people say "X is infinite," what that actually means is "I refuse to think about X."

When reading this post the book "The Sources of Social Power" written by Michael Mann came to my mind. He wrote that there are four major sources of power, which are political power, economical power, ideological power and military power. <br><br>Linking the ideology of progress to capitalism seems to me as being two different ways of exercising power by the economical elites. Thus we can see economical greed as the greed for economical power which is a subset of a general greed of power (let's assume that being an hierarchical animal greed for power is inherently human). <br><br>Since for exercising power effectively more than economical power is necessary, it has to be accompanied by other forms of power. "Progress" is the ideological power that removes any rational discussions about the necessity of externalizing costs. Political power can be, as you have written, bought (which is economical power being converted to political power). <br><br>Looking through Mann's glasses it seems obvious that progress has to come together with cost externalization and both are caused by an economical elite maximizing it's power. From this point of view, increasing technological complexity is not a cause for anything but a phenomenon of emergence, a symptom of socioeconomical processes. <br><br>Now that i have written these thoughts this theory may be incomplete, because it does not explain, how the socialist societies with planned economies and without economical elites created the same kind of environmental externalities. <br><br>Here the book "Spiral Dynamics" by Don Beck and Chris Cowan may help out with some interesting ideas. They see consciuousness as an emergent phenomenon that grows and includes increasing parts of our universe (not much to argue with that). Based on this idea cost externalization is caused by a consciousness that does not include the costbearer (other people and species) into ist own weltanschauung. So it seems as a cost reduction. This may explain why both socialism/planned economy and capitalism/marked economy produced environmental externalities, because both are socioeconomic worldviews which simply do not incorporate the biosphere. This may also explain why capitalism produces social externalities preferrentially in far away countries or at least in far away social strata. <br><br>Since it is always a bad idea to create a black and white world with good and bad people, i propose the following "big picture": Maximizing Profit is the exercise of economocal power by the economical elites. It is done using technology, which as a side effect becomes more and more complex. It is accompanied by the exerciese of political power (buying politicians) and ideological power (embracing the technological means of cost externalization as "progress"). The true bearer of cost is probably simply not on the radar of large parts of the economical elite (or when it is, it is not linked to the cost externalization). So to them the externalization is truly seen as a cost reduction and the ideology of "progress" is seemingly proving itself. <br><br>PS: Externalization has been a topic in my blog (<a href=http://deedls.blog.de/2013/12/16/externalitaeten-i-17415981/ rel=nofollow>part I</a> and <a href=http://deedls.blog.de/2014/01/03/externalitaeten-ii-17540822/ rel=nofollow>part II</a>).<br>Little Spoiler: The ultimative externalization is not externalizing cost, but externalizing risk. If youre company is "too-big-to-fail", then you succesfully externalized the risk of being an entrepreneur.<br>Another Topic of my blog has been the <a href=http://deedls.blog.de/2013/04/09/legitimierungszwang-15737010/ rel=nofollow>consciousness of economical elites</a>.<br><br><a href=the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html#c2765595298452706726 title="comment permalink">2/25/15, 10:18 PM</a><br><br>

I doubt anyone really sets out to generate externalities and dump leftover feedstock and various unwanted byproducts. The chemical company who dumps toxic sludge into the river isn't necessarily maximizing the owner's personal wealth if a little tweaking could instead maximize the conversion of feedstock to desired product and minimize the unwanted production of useless byproducts.

Those who invest in technology and externalize the most costs tend to have the most accurate and powerful means of defense. Without adequate defense, other greedy humans would overrun a society and take its property. As an aside, a dominant defense system typically allows a society to take other people's property too so it has a dual benefit. As resources become more and more scarce, everyone's defense systems become less and less complex until people are left only with sticks and stones. At that stage, those who are left may decide to put their sticks and stones down and figure out how to live a better life by working together. All will be well until some selfish person decides to take more than his share. Then the whole competitive fight for survival will ensue once again. Perhaps only a few are greedy. However, it only takes a few greedy leaders to push an entire society into a competition for "survival".<br><br><a href=the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html#c728070220326529184 title="comment permalink">2/25/15, 10:42 PM</a><br><br>

Consider your blivet smith hand forging blivets. Now the blivet smith stays up late one night with a largish bottle of home brew and conceives of a jig he can make in his shop, from scraps, that allow him to make 10 blivets an hour instead of 5 with more uniformity and less waste. This technological advance costs almost nothing, internalized or externalized (maybe he swiped the bottle and scraps from a neighbor). The scion of progress would extend this example indefinitely in search of maximum production. At some point, though, somewhere between the clever jig and the factory, pursuit of maximum production becomes harmful to the systems you describe above. In my mind, this is why appropriate tech as a category of tools is so vital - it responds to different paradigms than maximizing production: maximizing the health and well being of those systems you describe - social, economic, ecological. At some point, the pursuit of maximizing production leads to a great deal of externalized costs, as it must necessarily, as you point out. But the road there is bumpy and asymmetric. Would a hand-maker of blivets making 10 million blivets produce less externalized waste than a factory producing that number? I'm not sure that's knowable. We can say with more certainty whether or not the world needs 10 million blivets. If not, than we can point the finger at progress in the form of maximizing production.<br><br><a href=the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html#c7376076270726496755 title="comment permalink">2/25/15, 11:11 PM</a><br><br>

Instead of taking responsibility for our complicity as corporate cogs or imperial citizens, we follow our leaders' example and blame the system for forcing us to collaborate in its crimes. It's strange how many of my former co-workers were content to cannibalize their souls for an increasingly dispiriting, bedraggling middle-class lifestyle. What used to be the means to a happy life, financial security, has become an end in itself. People don't seem to realize that sacrificing everything else to achieve that will leave you spiritually void and incapable of joy. It's a good thing my conscience provided enough negative feedback to stop me before I collapsed completely. Unfortunately, most of us have been derelict in our duty as the conscience of the system.

I see industrial socialism as the natural end state of monopoly capitalism, when there really is only one firm producing everything -- and thus it's subject to exactly the same problems. <br><br>Hector, "spanked"? No, I just pointed out to you that you were misstating one of my points and ignoring another. As for waste, if a process that produces more waste is more profitable than a process that produces less, then standard economic theory and repeated experience alike show that the more wasteful process will be chosen. It's all very well to insist that nobody wants to produce waste; the point is that everyone in a market economy wants to maximize profit, and since pushing costs off onto somebody else is a proven and highly effective way to do that, dumping waste rather than "tweaking the process" (in the real world, usually an expensive procedure) is quite common. <br><br>Jason, I'd encourage you to do a bit of reading about how societies actually decline and fall; you'll find that the process has little to do with the scenario you've proposed. <br><br>Jcummings, again, that's why I specified <i>industrial</i> production, and the specific form of progress that involves increasing technological complexity. Improvements in craft technique are a different matter, as very often they have less to do with increasing technological complexity and more to do with learning and the development of skills, and don't necessarily increase externalities the way that technological complexity does. As I take this discussion further, I hope to clarify that a bit, and also bring in appropriate tech -- yes, it's very much part of all this. <br><br>Mickey, yes, and that's also a part of the discussion that needs to happen.<br><br><a href=the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html#c4979730827817075344 title="comment permalink">2/25/15, 11:31 PM</a><br><br>

That's the smell of money!"<br><br>In one of his books on lateral thinking, Edward de Bono proposed two solutions to such externalities:<br>1. Make the owners and administrators of a polluting factory live where the impact of their pollution is felt.<br>2. Place the water intake of a factory downstream from its water outlet.<br><br>These days, the accumulated effects of our externalities are such that we can't move away from them. The CO2 in the air has a world wide impact, it affects the global commons to our peril.<br><br>Technological progress as a means of "increasing the externalization of costs" makes perfect sense.<br>Consider one of the objections in comments: that sewage treatment plants are anti-externalitites. That objection fails to see the larger picture, that the plant is required because of an excessive concentration of people in an area. It makes it possible for that concentration of people to remain in a condition of overshoot, given what's required to maintain a society these days. The objection also ignores the energy and resources required to establish and operate these sewage plants.<br><br>As such, the objection is typical of the kinds of blind spots we've managed to develop, because we can't countenance the actual consequences of our actions.<br>Consider electrical vehicles. Their manufacture requires the use of several rare earth elements, and powering the batteries draws on the output from coal and nuclear plants, in most instances.<br>They're still considered a clean technology, because we have fixated on the fact that the vehicle doesn't emit exhaust fumes. We ignore the fact that the externalities are emitted elsewhere.<br><br>When hosting the APEC summit in Beijing, Chinese authorities did something they've apparently later come to regret. They instituted a ban on manufacturing activity and motoring inside a large radius circle around Beijing, in order to reduce air pollution.<br>During the conference, the skies above the city were blue, something people hadn't seen for a long time. The phenomenon was so astonishing that it earned a nick name: APEC Blue. It also raised a clamor for something to be done about the externalities of the Chinese economic "miracle." APEC Blue brought the cost home to those affected.<br><br>We fixate on isolated benefits of technological progress, and fail to see the larger picture. We see the EV without exhaust, and ignore where its energy comes from.<br>The citizens of Beijing had come to see air pollution as something natural, because they so rarely saw a clear blue sky. Instead, the rich came up with strategies to manage: air locked work places, homes, and schools for their children - and you better get rich yourself, to escape the pollution. The "smell of money" made them blind to what they were miring themselves in.<br><br>As such, it could be argued that technological progress, as we have come to define it, serves to help us maintain our blind spots to the actual consequences of our claimed advances.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html#c9181720515224139898 title="comment permalink">2/26/15, 12:19 AM</a><br><br>

The king was delighted by this as he believed it would help him in his endless war with the neighbouring kingdom and he poured lots of gold from the kingdoms taxes into the project. This net work became known as the Wise Wizards Web and more and more ordinary people bought crystal balls to participate in it.<br><br>Then one day the King of the neighbouring Kingdom died and in the ensuing chaos the King became less interested in the WWW and through it open for the use of anyone in the Kingdom. His subjects were very exciting believing this would usher in an era of equality, education and erudition unknown since fabled times.<br><br>However one man had an idea. Sauros worked for a money lender but thinking about the wise wizard web he wondered if he could use it for mercantile means., and as he paid the kingdom nothing for the use of the wise wizard web much of his overheads would be dispersed across the realm. Thinking about what to sell he hit upon scrolls as they were easy to transport and popular with both the sages and the common people. Renting an old stable in the land of a sympathetic Baron, he created a www spell that listed every scroll available in the kingdom. He called his spell ‘The amazing disjunction’. <br><br>The people were ecstatic, rather than having to dig through musty scrolls in booksellers shoppes they could just go to the spell site and a cart would arrive a few days later with it. Payment was handled by fairy dust which was found to flow very well through the network of crystal balls.<br><br>However before long people started to notice that the old scroll shoppes started to close down. They had to hire premises and booksellers, pay taxes not only to the cities but also the crown, and keep all the bothersome regulations enacted by good kings in the days of yore to protect the common people.<br>The ex-money lender however only needed a few uneducated serfs to service his mercantile concern and thanks to the friendly Barons rule he needed only pay them a few groats.<br><br>However still he was feted throughout the kingdom, invited to royal feasts, and his name shouted across the land. He bought more old stables and started selling other things via the crystal ball network, leather work, armour, clothing, farming equipment, he didn’t draw a distinction and as his enterprise grew more and more of the olde shoppes selling these items closed, and he employed more serfs to toil in his stables.<br><br>However by now lust for gold had corrupted his heart and all this was not enough. He told the cart drivers that he would reduce the few pennies he paid them for transport to half that amount. Only the biggest cart driving cartels could survive these rates and then only by cutting the pittance they paid their drivers. Other carters were driven out of business, and commoners wanting to make deliveries discovered that many things could no longer be sent easily by cart. Indeed not even tiny chicks.<br><br>Next he turned his gaze to the makers of scrolls and he told them from now on you must sell me your scrolls for half the price you used to and you must sell them to no one else who might sell them on for a higher price than I. The scrolled makers quailed before his baleful gaze and did as they were told. Of course this meant they had to go to the sages and wizards who wrote the scrolls and tell them that they could no longer afford to pay them what they used to. Many writers who once survived by their words now went hungry.<br><br>Many other dark deeds did the mighty Sauros go on to do, each one adding to his power and wealth, and impoverishing more and more common folk, and the people started to mutter that a darkness had entered the land. But alas Sauros had corrupted the hearts of the King and his court and they could only slavishly chant ‘ Mighty Sauros is a force of progress, we must bow before him and worship him’.<br><br>Until one day…<br><br><a href=the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html#c5922608207046551036 title="comment permalink">2/26/15, 12:30 AM</a><br><br>

It flourished culturally nonetheless, to the extent that at least one religious group wanted to declare it "the Promised Age," a lot like the "Millennium" that some Christians say will arrive after Armageddon. The tyrants chose stability rather than "progress."<br>This was Edo Era Japan.<br>On July 8, 1853, folks near Edo (now Tokyo) noticed an odd sight: some warships entering their harbor under a cloud of black smoke. The Americans, led by Commodore Perry, demanded Japan to open its doors to commerce.<br>The Japanese sized up the situation very quickly, and after overthrowing the Tokugawa rulers, who were pretty helpless in the face of the present challenge. Under the young Meiji Emperor, the country embarked on modernization. They realized they had to, or get run over and be enslaved by the colonizers.<br>The cancer, I'm afraid, took root. I'm on the editorial staff of an environmental research journal, and the next issue is focusing on political-academic-industrial cooperation for a brighter future. They are truly starting to see all the results of externalities coming home to Japan, but the people are not ready to put two and two together.<br><br><a href=the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html#c61894808747012165 title="comment permalink">2/26/15, 12:41 AM</a><br><br>

This latest series of posts is reaching new levels of archdruid awesomeness.<br><br>I think meme might be another word that's useful when discussing the cooperative writing you mention in the beginning of this week's essay. I write a blog that focuses on my little city's economy, and things the community can do and maybe should think twice about to create a more convivial economy.<br><br>I use that word specifically to honor Ivan Illich and his wonderful book, <i>Tools for Conviviality.</i> Illich also wrote <i>Energy and Equity,</i> a book in which he predicted the disintegration of society due to ever higher quanta of energy per human. This energy creates ever more complex technologies--the energy complexity spiral, not his term, but similar (and he included things like the medical and educational and transportation systems under technology) that eventually passed beyond a controllable, healthy, convivial human scale. He also foresaw the one percent problem, arguing that increasing energy use funneled more and more wealth to fewer and fewer individuals, creating the kind of equity gap we see today.<br><br>I am currently reporting on a gas station renovation project in the middle of my town that has gone awry--a number of additional, older, unexpected tanks were unearthed, and they have been leaking into the soil. The Dept. of Environmental Conservation (a bit of Newspeak?) is now involved. Tests are being done up to several hundred feet away, to make sure underground feeder streams are not bearing toxins into the nearby creek. The hole we dig grows ever deeper(that was the subtitle of my follow-up post.) <br><br>After one of my posts, a reader took me to task for not knowing what I was talking about in terms of "remediation", not using the correct technical terms (neither was true, but anyway). His main argument was hey, these things happen all the time, we have ways to fix it, it's the risk of being in the petrol business.<br><br>Yes, but who bears those risks, right? (And what a relief to know these things happen all the time!) In my current draft of a post responding to him, (takes a couple days between work and family) I write:<br><br>"It's an unwavering faith in science and technology, in the belief that things always progress in the direction of improvement and betterment for all (or at least for us, all can come later.) I will say that constantly running around spending huge amounts of capital and energy cleaning up messes caused by our use of fossil fuels is the definition of unsustainable, if only for the simple reason that, as extraction of the energy consumes more and more of our capital and energy resources, there will be less and less left over for the metaphorical rolls of Bounty to clean up the external costs. For example, the LUST fact sheet linked in the third paragraph above states, <i>"The U.S. EPA released The National LUST Cleanup Backlog study in 2011, which reports that 'sufficient LUST Trust monies are not available to address all eligible sites.'” </i>Also note that the fund itself is due to expire in September 2016 (though it has been extended in the past.)<br><br>LUST, by the way, is the Environmental Protection Agency's Acronym for Leaking Underground Storage Tanks--now there's an externality out of sight, out of mind--at least until someone decides to beautify their gas station.<br><br>The first sentence in that paragraph can be attributed to ideas gleaned directly from reading this fantastic blog for the past several years, while the external cost reference may be an example of that concept building up some steam as a meme for another run at the zeitgeist. As always, I look forward to next week's post! Thank you.<br><br><a href=the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html#c5944773944354735917 title="comment permalink">2/26/15, 3:46 AM</a><br><br>

It ties in with the crazy notion that the environment is a subset of the economy, rather than vice versa. I never did work out how the economy includes everything else, yet the externalities leave the economy.<br><br>Add to it the dogma that a system of actors seeking their own best interests (ie profit) drives an efficient market that provides the greatest collective good, and we are expected to perceive an 'invisible hand' at work.

Most of us have conscience and can't do that, so we fail and are overrun by those who will. Because we are also moral cowards who won't face them and ourselves. <br><br>Also that our complicity in the system thus created slowly drives the population quite mad with dissonance. Participating in the system that keeps us alive requires us either to be evil or to create doublethink to hide our evil from ourselves. This is also why we have 1st world self-loathing which believes humans are innately evil and need to be killed en masse, along with the entire culture annihilated in apocalyptic fury--much commented on here.<br><br>In contrast, none of these are true: they are a choice of morality. As Mahatma said, "There is enough for everyone's need but not everyone's greed." We can face the externalities we are responsible for and say, "Hey, I can't dump in the river because that would be, um, manslaughter." Simple. We do this from time to time: first we said slavery was legal and moral, then we said it was immoral, and later illegal. <br><br>But when en masse the culture ignores morality, it is free to dump externalities and collect profits by killing others by the millions as we do now. Without a return to morality, there can be no change in the thermodynamic inertial system we've created, because those who are externalizing are too powerful and can always buy off any attempted regulation. Only within a moral argument and moral risk, a will to moral behavior do they have to change.<br><br>If they do not return to morality of not stealing/hurting/killing others, then yes, the society itself will dissolve and collapse as described, and rightfully so, as ultimately it is killing or driving mad nearly everyone and you have to be a psychopath to survive in it.<br><br><a href=the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html#c4389984934015888884 title="comment permalink">2/26/15, 4:57 AM</a><br><br>

Fine medicine to heal alienation and open avenues for joy. It is hard labor, too. I am hearing something like this among friends, too.

So my suggestion would be to sort out the fear and defensiveness to get on the path to retrace our steps. That would unwind the motor ever running to reach the center of the galaxy. All that said, a warm shower whenever I want it is a wonderful pleasure. Makes me feel like a spankin' new human. Bathing in sauna is different.

So it is to a company's benefit to pay the very lowest wages they can get away with, expecting that the better wages at other companies will keep their sales up.

Adoption of complex systems requires significant taxes and subsidies (think rural electrification and now 'internetification') which must be paid by everyone, not just the beneficiaries. For our farm, we must increase profits to support satellite internet access - otherwise the cost cannot be supported. Yet without it, we would rapidly become wholly local (not bad, but a decline in living standard would be instant). How much of the satellite cost is inherently externalized? Most I imagine - so we still must ride on the backs of the group to have internet access...<br><br>Again, we have a privately owned 'county water company' that generates profits for shareholders somewhere.

Close inspection may reveal that such examples may not actually be exceptions to your thesis, but for purposes of a thought experiment, say they do seem to defy your assertions here.<br><br>In this case, the increased technological complexity would result in products and/or services which really are lower in cost, i.e. more affordable.

No, aggregate demand for energy and resources and aggregate waste production associated with personal computing over this time period has increased so much as to nullify efficiency gains.

Smartphones, electric cars, smart grids, and a whole slew of "green" (though decidedly not appropriate) technologies exist solely to mitigate the externalities created by computer driven, bureaucratic, non-local working conditions that are themselves the externalized pains of previous technological breakthroughs. This also helps us identify the groups who are able to regress - those who drop out of the "system" (collapsing now) free themselves of the externalized costs loaded onto workers and citizens and so can regress - though a huge part of the pain of regression is dealing with the many other whole-system externalities.

In effect, he takes the notion of externality much further, to include not only externalities such as the impacts of asbestos or atmospheric carbon, but of entities of any sort placed beyond the boundaries of what constitutes the cosmos of any given collective.<br><br>At any given moment in the “progressive composition” of a collective, the latter can be found to have incorporated certain entities and relations, “but that also means that it has eliminated other propositions” (p. 124), being unable or unwilling to take them into account, consigning them to an exterior or unexamined negative space of ever accumulating <br>“excluded entities, beings that the collectivity has decided to do without, for which it has refused to take responsibility—let us remember that these entities can be humans, but also animal species, research programs, concepts…that at one moment or another are consigned to the dumping ground of a particular collective. We no longer have a society surrounded by a nature, but a [human/non-human] collective producing a clear distinction between what it has internalized and what it has externalized.” (p. 124). <br><br>But thus far in the account we find nothing, however, that obliges us to say <br>“that these externalized entities will always remain outside the collective….So what are the entities that have been set aside going to do? They are going to put the collective in danger, always provided that the power to take into account is sensitive and alert enough. What is excluded by the power to put in order* at t0 can come back to haunt the power to take into account at t + 1” (pp. 124-125).<br><br>A viable collective is precisely one that is able to invest the entities--the misery of asbestosis, climate catastrophe, economic, societal and biospheric systems, gods, slaves--with the power to put the collective in danger or the power to reveal where it is already suffering, with voices that hold sway.<br><br><a href=the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html#c4379859455908142211 title="comment permalink">2/26/15, 7:50 AM</a><br><br>

I'm not necessarily voting for it as a practical solution, but I resonate with the indigenous Mayan perspective presented by Martin Prechtel while being interviewed by Derrick Jensen for Sun Magazine. First, there is an acknowledgement of the externalities created by, say, making a knife - not only the physical, but the "less-tangible" costs. These are paid for through ritual; if the ritual is skipped (the externalities not acknowledged and paid,) then the tool will "shed blood" rather than do beneficial work. (This is a apt metaphor our current blood shedding technological progress.) Second, Martin tells of their buildings which are built just well enough to provide shelter for an understood "lifetime," often only a few years or decades. There is no deception as in our culture, that we can make "timeless" structures, or even that that would be preferable. The eventual dilapidation and failure of the mayan villagers' housing presents opportunities for work, for gathering, for grieving, and for rebuilding. I've often thought that the greatest leg up for the USA in becoming a superpower was that it was most recently built - but with our obsession in creating permanence, the latest "permanent" construction is only best until better comes along, and then it is too permanent and embedded to improve. <br>http://thesunmagazine.org/issues/304/saving_the_indigenous_soul<br><br><a href=the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html#c8219717417083598574 title="comment permalink">2/26/15, 8:32 AM</a><br><br>

Somewhat like a person being shot - like the externalizing of costs, the technical thing which causes death is the loss of blood. In this analogy, the paradigms underlying progress are the notions which lead to the pulling of the trigger, launching the bullet, which ultimately cause the damage.<br><br>There are some splitting of hairs here, but the reason I think it's important goes back to the blivet forger who comes up with a new jig. If her operating paradigm is in line with those that mark industrialism, then much like Walmart began as a mom &amp; pop local store, that blivet jig is but the first step in an industrial process. If, on the other hand, that smith's operating paradigm is along other, more life sustaining lines, then that jig is, as you suggest, an appropriate tech, craft-style improvement.<br><br>I see far too many artisan-style growers and craftspeople who market their wares as part of a life-sustaining movement, but whose operating paradigm is that of industrialism, and so who aren't really any better than their industrialist counterparts.

Non-renewable energy and the technology it powers enable and turbo-charge this desire. Without cheap and available resources you could still maximize your profits through unethical and destructive methods, but these would be the more direct and brutal methods known for centuries: war and slavery and exploitation. And they all require leaders to get their hands dirty. <br><br>Whereas for a modern CEO, and certainly a CEOs employees and customers, it's possible to externalize horrific costs to Slobbovia, thus preventing them from needing to act brutally or from being faced directly with the consequences of their actions. And I think that tends to shield us from questions of conscience in these matters, as well as just preventing us from the practical impacts of polluting our own backyards in the careless manufacture of family blivet needs. <br><br>The original Wall Street movie, from the 80's, had that great line "...the problem with money, Bud--it makes you do things you don't want to do". I think that line works for cheap energy, even more so. <br><br>Also, logistically, it should actually be a lot easier to control Blivet production pollution if Blivet production is concentrated in a small number of locations, rather than if it is spread out across many thousands of locations across the globe or in every major town. That's similar to the challenges of controlling point source and non-point source pollution. Politically, though, it is of course impossible to get those same very powerful people to do things they don't want to do, especially when they have a good degree of control over the levers of government.<br><br><a href=the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html#c8481431929866076895 title="comment permalink">2/26/15, 8:56 AM</a><br><br>

A swindle, indeed. Thus the corporations shout to the heavens about the holy marketplace and "unfair regulation" when guvmint dares to, say, require them to shoulder some of the burden placed on the biosphere and public health by their externalities, but go running and whining to that same evil guvmint the moment the cruel realities of the marketplace send the grim reaper to their door.<br><br>Without lemon socialism, for example, most of the big banks in the US --which under anything but the pretend accounting "standards" now permitted them by the guvmint are insolvent -- would be memories today. The only domestic auto maker still standing after the crisis of 2006-2008 would be Ford, which somehow managed to foresee the mess and didn't require a bailout. <br><br>I'm often amazed at how cleverly lemon socialism is disguised. For example, a blogger I regularly read was recently excoriating electric cars -- a worthy mission -- based on the fact that Tesla wouldn't exist without massive subsidies. Um, what about GM? Imagine a world in which GM was required to pay not just for the pollution its factories generate, but for the infrastructure (roads, public parking garages, traffic signals, enforcement) required to use its products?

As there is no profit motive, they try very hard to comply with all aspects of regulation ( EPA, state reg, cleanwater act etc.) and have generaly developed a culture of technofixes and reductionism to help do this. Unlike most private enterprises they face stiff fines if they violate their permit, and at each facility there is a "jailable" official who can be held crimeanliy liable for flagerant violations. Doing this costs more and more over time as regulations become more stringent ( beleive it or not) and the costs of technology and the overall complexity of the system that results add up. In the old days much of these costs were externalized in the form of "free" federal money to build and upgrade facilities. But now pretty much all the cost have to be passed on to the ratepayers, which is resulting in quickly rising sewer rates in her utility as well as most others around the country. <br><br>This has resulted in much pushback from ratepayers and even in ratepayer revolts where the costs are framed as public sector corruption, waste etc. There is no doubt that in some places this may be true, but in most utilities in is the hard cost os technological complexity and energy that can not be externalized or shipped off to the third world that people are faced with first hand. What most ratepayers ( average citizens) don't realize is that most of the costs are caused by themselves in externalizing their costs by sending them down the sewer. High water use, toxic cleaners, pharmacuticals, and even the microplastic beads in facial scrubs cost every increasing amounts of money to remove ( take out of water and put somewher else). Only by taking out all these things at the source ( i.e. not useing them) and reducing water use to a bare minimum can the costs eventually go down.

New technology could *theoretically* allow an internalization of costs as well. One example would be smokestack scrubbers that capture the particulate matter emanating from smokestacks. A good portion of the gypsum board used in construction is made from such captured material. Another example would be the capture of waste heat used in cogeneration. Of course, whether these are implemented or not has much to do with the regulatory atmosphere as much as anything else.<br><br>What makes a change count s progress is:<br><br>1.) Whether it allows wealth to be centralized. There are all sorts of things that could be considered “progress” but are not implemented because it does not increase profits to the already fortunate and makes the common person better off. Mumford pointed out that the Middle Ages was full of technological advances in the service of small, distributed communities serving human values, whereas the technological regime since the Enlightenment has had the results of centralizing power and turning people into cogs in a machine. <br><br>2.) Whether it conveys some sort of meaning. See this excellent article: <a href=http://berkeleyjournal.org/2015/01/morality-and-the-idea-of-progress-in-silicon-valley/ rel=nofollow>Morality and Progress in Silicon Valley</a>. The article points out that the idea of progress is essentially a *moral* argument and thus cannot be measured by traditional means such as ROI, GDP, efficiency, etc. As the article puts it, <i>“To put it another way, progress is the only myth left when rationality has eviscerated other sources of meaning. Because of our faith in progress we have granted rationality itself a positive moral valence.”</i><br><br>I think the better argument is diminishing returns to technology. Econ 101: when you increase one input in a process while keeping all other inputs equal, you run into diminishing marginal returns. After a certain point, you may even run into negative returns.<br><br>There are all sorts of inputs that cannot be increased – we have only one stomach and two eyes, there are twenty-four hours in a day, the days of our life are three score and ten, we have a narrow range of temperature in which we are comfortable, there is only so much water, topsoil, etc. and so on. Even the endorphins in our brain limit our happiness levels. Increase technology given those facts and you cease to benefit after a certain point. Plus, the low hanging fruits are harvested first – technology that makes a big difference is invented first making marginal gains progressively less beneficial. As economist Robert Gordon has pointed out, we probably have not invented anything better than indoor plumbing in terms of benefits to the economy.<br><br><a href=the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html#c3535321701397135742 title="comment permalink">2/26/15, 9:46 AM</a><br><br>

(As an aside related to the current economic situation, our plant is scheduled to be closed at the end of June, so myself and roughly 100 fellow workers here will be out of a job.)<br>I'd like to submit that, in the context of the current growth-addicted market economy, even those rare instances where increases in technological complexity work to actually decrease externalities in principle, the net effect is an overall increase in externalities. This fits even some of these "exceptions" into the model of JMG's argument. <br>For example, last year, we purchased an installed a system here at the plant designed to significantly improve the combustion efficiency of gas delivered to our natural gas fired glass furnace. It worked. We now have a cleaner exhaust gas leaving through the smokestack. However, before we call the game in favor of technological complexity, consider WHY we did this, and the predictable result. We didn't install this new technology for the sake of reducing externalities by having cleaner emissions. We did it so that we could increase the tons of glass per day we produce while still meeting the government imposed emissions limits. So, the we now have the ability to melt more sand per day, thus producing more glass for our customers. It would be difficult to quantify, but I'd be willing to bet that the decrease in air pollution externalities we achieved is more than offset by the increases in externalities related to our increase in daily production. For instance: in sand, salt cake, limestone, and dolomite mining and transportation, the transportation of more glass product, increases in the other pollution streams from our own process, etc. Not to mention the externalities involved in manufacturing, transporting, and installing the technology itself.<br><br>I guess it's sort of a modified Jevons' paradox? If the effect of a technology or suite of technologies is to decrease externalities in one local area of a process, it tends to increase most other externalities related to the process. <br>Maybe this isn't always true, but in my 7 year career in corporate industrial manufacturing, this has always been the case.<br><br><br><a href=the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html#c2352884650293349749 title="comment permalink">2/26/15, 9:53 AM</a><br><br>

Well done.<br><br>My wife and I own a little herbal products company in north Georgia (smallbatchgarden.com), and produce a variety of original products meant to replace more toxic industrial products - essential oil and witchhazel insect repellant that works just as well as DEET, a comfrey cream that heals any skin (and deeper) problem you put it on, a Tiger Balm-esque muscle and joint rub based again on essential oils, and so on.<br><br>Unfortunately, as wonderful as all that sounds, we still have to buy, and have shipped, an array of containers that appeal to our target demographic. The bugspray bottles come from China! Of all places. Because we can't find a domestic option that looks nearly as good for anything like the price we're paying to get them from China. Obviously today's argument has a lot to do with that. And it's a constant weight on our conscience.<br><br>Fortunately, I've also just been reading your book 'Green Wizardry', where you discuss the concept of "staged disconnection," or I might just have to slip into a bout of self-loathing!<br><br>The products we make are high quality, at least as effective, and much less toxic than their industrial counterparts, and once the raw materials arrive at our house carry almost zero additional externalities. Assuming that recycling plastic bottles, say, that contained witchhazel, is in fact a worthwhile way to handle that waste. Which I'm far from convinced is accurate.<br><br>We're producing and foraging a lot of our own food, almost ALL of our medicine, live an extremely low-impact life (22W of solar, wood cook/heating stove, sawdust toilet, root cellaring, fermenting, etc), but for now, we still have to make at least some money, somehow, to pay property taxes, phone service, auto insurance, and be able to go out once in a while. Or else take an outside job working for someone else, where even more of the problems discussed in today's post come into play I think.<br><br>So, are we being overly critical of our business impacts at his point? Should we be paying more for uglier bottles that nobody will buy? Anybody got any ideas for attractive bugspray bottles that are made, or could be made, closer to north Georgia? We've talked about shifting from metal tins for our salves to refillable pottery ones made by us or a neighbor, that, once the initial container is paid for, would cost the repeat customer a good deal less, especially as metal prices continue their ascent toward the heavens. Down the road a bit still I think. But plastic spray bottles? How do you low tech those? And, no, rub-on insect repellants aren't nearly as desirable to most people as spray-ons. At least not in our experience.<br><br>Or perhaps the answer is, like most other facets of industrial life, that we will just have to learn to do without certain things like manufactured insect repellants, in a deindustrial future?

A past career as a CSA grower (Prairie Dock Farm) gave me great appreciation of how the many externalized of costs of industrialized agriculture devalues labor and locality. A goal of our CSA was to incorporate as many of the costs of production as possible, and so we worked to understand the economic, social, and ecological (and spiritual) costs, so that they could be managed as holistically as possible.<br><br>Reducing input from off farm (fertilizers, energy and equipment), along with matter and energy bio-cycling and positive feed back loops, and reducing intermediaries helped reduce our externalized costs. It instead, put a value on human labor and invested in human dignity, often creating meaning in the farm’s owner’s and operators lives. The strategies implemented to reduce externalities tended to also sequestered carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, etc and energy of our farm. Hopefully we acted in a restorative manner.<br><br>IMO An economic system that does not have the discipline to internalize cost of production and externalizes them on the public and environment, is by definition not capitalism, but socialism, at least in part. This type of economic system is exploitive, consuming social and ecological capital and not sustainable. It marginalized our attempt to value labor, locality and a clean environment on our farm.<br><br>A better model of economics would respect social and ecological capital and be precautionary in its actions, thus internalizing costs of production. It would incentives and reward creation of social and ecological capital and be restorative in nature. <br><br>Going back to more simple 1950’s technologies could help make agriculture more restorative, because there would be fewer intermediaries and technology suites to account for. It would bring back a more human scale to agriculture and restore locality to the food production system. <br><br>If this is the type of regress you are postulating, sign me up! I want to help.<br><br>Greg<br><br><a href=the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html#c5809130799651957833 title="comment permalink">2/26/15, 11:56 AM</a><br><br>

The committee was trying to explain the need for affordable housing for further growth in our city, as the biggest employer in town is looking to expand and will need lots of low-to-mid income workers. The idea that people need to be able to afford to live within the area to work in the area was brought up over and over, sometimes as an appeal to fairness for the democrats in the audience, and sometimes as a practicality for the republicans. Their proposed solution is to tax everyone and use that money to help pay for rental assistance and "low-income housing projects". I pointed out that these are really short term solutions and don't really solve the underlying issue. I suggested that perhaps our city should put in some sort of restrictions on any developers putting up more than 10 houses, saying that they had to make 20-30% of them "affordable" in a way that Minneapolis/St. Paul had instituted in the 60's and 70's. I've attatched a link to an article in the Atlantic that explained this policy and it's positive long term affects to the city.<br>http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/03/the-miracle-of-minneapolis/384975/<br>The idea was immediatley shot down as being impracticle as, "that would be less profitable for the developers". I bring up this story because it ties into what you've been saying in a couple ways. <br>First, this is another good example of how companies are more interested in creating profit than a product that is actually good or in demand (we have high demand for houses under $200,000, but no one is building them).<br>The second point is that we are taking it for granted that the way things are is the way they must be. Being a housing developer has been incredibly profitable for such a long time that our local government is writing up laws with more concern for their profitability than with the actual product on the streets. I've noticed the same thing in articles pointing out how little young rock stars are making today compared to the 80's and 90's. The media is trying to act as if society has made some sort of contract that garantees rock stars, CEOs and developers will make a certain amount of money no matter their productivity, and if they aren't making that much, we should change the laws to better meet those expectations. What is left unsaid is that their may well be plenty of other people or job positions that can do the same thing better if we allow them to.<br><br>"Free Lunch" by by David Cay Johnston is an excellent book with lots of examples of this kind of thinking.<br><br><a href=the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html#c433160537511837642 title="comment permalink">2/26/15, 12:53 PM</a><br><br>

In particular, I'm thinking about the insistence in our industrial economy of just-in-time distribution systems -- highly efficient, when everything goes just right, but highly susceptible to even mild disruption.<br><br><a href=the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html#c642393494666288667 title="comment permalink">2/26/15, 8:46 PM</a><br><br>

Greater technological complexity and greater externalization of costs are correlated but one does not necessarily cause the other.<br><br>My reasons for thinking so are as follows:<br><br>There is a well documented direct relationship between energy use per capita and population and population density. Surplus energy beyond subsistence needs allows for more people to live in a given space. Greater population density in turn allows for greater societal complexity. These relationships applies to all civilizations, not just our industrial one. Basically, the greater the energy surplus available to a society, the more different things people in it can do other than just getting by. <br><br>There is also a direct relationship between technological complexity and societal complexity. Simply put: the greater the range of things we do, the greater the number of different tools required to do those things.<br><br>So … it follows that there is a direct relationship between energy use per capita and technological complexity.<br><br>Whenever energy is used, some of it is lost doing something you didn't intend it to do. This is one way of stating the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics. Typically the energy used and dissipated is carried by something with mass. Electricity requires copper cables, engines require working fluids, waste heat is carried off in flue gases and cooling fluids, etc. <br><br>So … the more energy a society uses, generally the more waste energy there is. Typically this energy is carried off by actual waste mass. It is some portion of this waste mass that is the problem i.e. pollution. Though pollution is certainly not the only externalization of costs inherent in any civilization, it is one of the ones we can most easily quantify.<br><br>It is certainly true that much o what we do has the technical potential for greater thermodynamic efficiencies that would reduce the waste energy and so pollution. [This is not the only way to reduce pollution of course; we could actually expend energy doing so.] But that there will always be some waste energy is a law of nature. Again, its the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics. <br><br>As JMG has taken pains to point out, “technical potential” does not mean “economic potential”. The thermodynamic efficiency of a particular technology is often determined by its economic sweet spot. This economic sweet spot itself is just a representation of the energy trade offs e.g. capital costs versus life cycle costs represent actual up front manufacturing energy costs versus the energy costs incurred in using the technology.<br><br>Nonetheless, should there be a gain in thermodynamic efficiency in a specific process in a society, this just means more surplus energy is now available. This in turn just leads to greater population and population density and so greater societal and technological complexity. These increases use up the extra energy made available by the gain in efficiency and then some resulting in even more energy use (should it be available). The greater energy use then leads to greater pollution on sum. Jevon's paradox is a facet of this process at work. <br><br>One could go through a similar analysis for any other externalized cost of industrial civilization. Take social inequity as an example. Such inequity can only arise in conditions of high population density. This density can only occur if surplus energy is available to allow it.<br><br>To be clear, it is not the greater technological complexity itself that necessarily creates more pollution, or more social inequity, or more of most other externalities. Its the availability and use of more surplus energy that allows for more technological complexity, more external costs, and more private benefits.<br><br><a href=the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html#c8621885436081704553 title="comment permalink">2/26/15, 8:52 PM</a><br><br>

Craftsmen could only become wealthy on the quality of their work - that was the only market differential. Guild members paid into a common pot to support members who couldn't work, and also to fund giant parties.<br>Then came the rise of the Protestant Ethic and its lonely road to salvation, with an angry God who liked you more if you were wealthy.

I'm suggesting that managing entropy becomes impossible if you have limitless technological progress, because as technology becomes progressively more complex, the entropy burden imposed on whole systems rises to the point of collapse. There are other things that can drive entropy to the point of collapse, too -- it's just that this post discusses progress in particular. <br><br>Professor D., maybe so, but we've spent the last two millennia trying to get people to be better than they are by way of moral exhortation, and you'll notice that it hasn't worked. In particular, tossing around labels such as "psychopath" and "moral coward" has proven to be a radically ineffective strategy for inducing change. Thus I'm interested in exploring more productive options. <br><br>Jonathan, and of course that's a valid point. As noted above, I tend to think of industrial socialism as the natural endpoint of industrial capitalism, the point at which one corporate organization monopolizes both the political and the economic sphere, so it would follow that the same bad habits would occur with even more force in socialist countries. <br><br>Passive Solar, good. I've noted in other contexts that people who won't practice self-discipline aren't able to practice any other kind of discipline, either, so you may have a point. Still, it's a source of wry amusement to me that the same people who babble on about the glories of the free market are usually the first in line when it comes to trying to protect themselves and their wealth against market forces. <br><br>Kyoto, exactly. My suspicion is that a huge fraction of current technology would be hopelessly uneconomical if it had to pay for all its externalities. <br><br>Brian, there are ways. I'll be discussing that as we proceed. <br><br>Sixbears, yes, there are cases here and there where that's true. There are also many more where it's not, which is why I used that pesky word "tends" in my post, you know. <br><br>RogerCO, got it in one. <br><br>Kristiina, we can have more variation, more diversity, if we don't board the spaceship -- there's really very little room for diversity in a spacecraft, after all!<br><br>Jason, my disagreement was with your suggestion that people will sit down and cooperate with one another as things slide down the curve of complexity. I can't speak for your Native American ancestors, but mine used to raid their neighbors, steal horses and other goods, and kill any enemy warriors they could catch. My Celtic ancestors did pretty much the same thing, for that matter -- though in their case it was mostly cattle that were the object of the raids, rather than horses. Poverty and technological simplicity do not necessarily, or even generally, make for peaceful cooperation!<br><br>Marc, if technological complexity keeps increasing, and externalities keep piling up, you'd probably have to have a steady population decrease in order to stave off collapse. I suppose that would make a fun science fiction story: the last human being alive in a future hyper-high tech society, whose Jetsons lifestyle imposes so many costs on the biosphere that there can only be one of him. Then the robots come to him and very politely let him know that the next round of technological progress will impose such drastic externalities on the planet that it won't be possible to support any human beings at all, and would he mind ingesting this cyanide pill so that progress can march on without him?<br><br><a href=the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html#c1487630081501245883 title="comment permalink">2/26/15, 10:22 PM</a><br><br>

As for ephemeralization, in theory, it's a great idea; far more often than not, in practice, <a href=../../2013/10/the-flight-to-ephemeral.html rel=nofollow>things look simpler because the real costs are being externalized elsewhere</a>. <br><br>Witter, very funny.

I'd also point out that citing individual technologies out of context, and usually with no reference to their supply chain and whole systems cost, is a standard bit of cornucopian rhetoric, and very misleading to those who aren't used to thinking in terms of whole systems. <br><br>Dave and William, of course there are always externalized costs, even among nonhuman organisms. My point is that limitless progress leads to a rising tide of externalities on the whole-system level, leading to collapse. It's the change in externalities over time that matters, not the mere fact of externalities. <br><br>Wolfgang, good. One of the core methods of social control in industrial societies is the propagation of the belief that "progress" (meaning: doing what the beneficiaries of the existing order want you to do) is not something you can choose or not, it's mandatory.

And of course most people forget, when the word "efficiency" is used, to remember that the question that has to be asked is "efficient at what?"<br><br>Twilight, it was a combination of the two, in most cases. Old societies, in particular, tend to be very defensive of a way of life that works, because they've had plenty of exposure to ways of life that didn't. <br><br>Indus56, excellent! Yes, those are exactly the questions that need to be asked. <br><br>Ember, exactly. One question to consider is whether the second set of regressers can be helped to use their temporary access to wealth to establish patterns that others, without that, can follow. I'll be talking about that as we proceed. <br><br>Howard, just one of the services I offer!<br><br>Indus56, it's been way too long since I read Latour. Thanks for the reminder. <br><br>Stacey, that's one of the reasons I'm not a Tennyson fan. I prefer the ancient Greek story that after he got back to Ithaca, he walked inland with an oar over his shoulder until he found a place where nobody knew what the odd piece of wood was, and settled there with Penelope for the rest of his days. <br><br>Shhh, I think both of those have a place, but I think there may be other factors as well: it's not just that archetypes haven't kept pace, it's that the core archetypal narratives -- oh, all right, let's be honest and call them myths -- that govern most thinking in this society are based on a very specific lie. I'll be talking about what that is further in this sequence.<br><br>1ab, I think the UFO cult was a first draft of what a wholly non-material cult of progress would look like. Stick progress in another galaxy and hope that the aliens will bring it to us someday -- yes, that might work. It certainly beats hoping against all experience that the next round of shiny new technologies will be less flimsy and tawdry than all the others have been. <br><br>GHung, I've talked at some length about why I think that response is so common. When you know in your gut that you've flushed your great-grandchildren's future down the loo in order to buy a few more years of extravagant living, owning up to that fact in public is not going to be easy. <br><br>Ember, those are worthwhile perspectives. I keep returning, though, to this point: we're not going to see changes in society until we see them being modeled, first, by individuals. How will you change your life today to decrease your externalities? To my mind, that's the question that matters. <br><br>Jcummings, no argument -- it's the underlying narratives and ways of thinking that shape the whole pattern, and actions unfold from those. That's why this blog focuses so tautly on changing ideas and narratives.<br><br><a href=the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html#c706209926834142574 title="comment permalink">2/26/15, 11:13 PM</a><br><br>

Most increases in technological complexity, though, do. <br><br>Denys, by all means take it to Green Wizards -- the forum's moderated but it certainly has a lot more flexibility than I can get away with allowing here. <br><br>Yupped, oh, granted. Stopping technological progress from driving a society into the externality trap isn't a solution to everything that can go wrong with a human society -- it's just a step back from one particular abyss. <br><br>Sukey, I'm curious. Did you know that this blog has been discussing personal responses to our predicament for almost nine years now? <br><br>Varun, I hope so. Actually, I'd be happier if we were building a future that didn't have a special field of study called economics, in that what we now call economics was wholly incorporated in the larger and more honest field of human ecology. <br><br>Friction Shift, back in the day, the standard response to a blivet maker (etc.) who went broke was to say, "Well, that's too bad. I sure hope he can find something else to do for a living." <br><br>Changeling, yep -- that's a solid example. <br><br>Clay, and of course the ratepayers never think about the fact that they're externalizing costs onto the utility by using all those difficult-to-remove compounds. <br><br>CJ, there are human societies that have deliberately put a lid on technological expansion and let Malthusian factors take care of population growth, so yes, we can be different than yeast. The insistence that we're not strikes me as another way of excusing the status quo. <br><br>Beatrice, by all means concentrate on your life on the land, but consider doing something to help someone else make a similar choice as well. Do you take in WWOOFers, apprentices, or the like? <br><br>Øyvind, ah -- has someone redefined the word "commons," then?

Reading some of the professional comments above I see the transformation, as in Germany, of the state roll, from protecting industrial interests, to including unions, to environment as in their party systems. The saving of money and cleansing of the environment by capture of wastes at source is wise economically and politically in a densely populated environment. The latest I recall on this is end product take back at end of life cycle, as in cars. If they <br>were exported around the globe, as is usual, that would be hard, usually scrap metal or West African used car lot(what a talented mechanic can acheive). <br><br>So progress is a concept in general which changes to accommodate the problems we create. We have been bootstrapping since time began and will continue to do so. <br><br>I have a jingle in my head recently, ca. 1977<br>Rock on by David Essex.<br>It is full of nostalgic Elvis, jimmy dean, and film references, plus sexual relationship changes(girls in blue jeans)but these lines stick out.<br><br>where do we go from here?<br>which is the way that's clear?<br><br>So late 70s boomers saw technology(film, pop music), social changes(youth and sexual rebellion) of past culminating in their present and were worried about what would come.<br>How would the consensus redefine progress. We know how that turned out. Reagan as sock puppet of Chicago boys gave us free money, fantasy world, growth. China got all factories India got computer, accounting, telephone advice jobs. Unions are dead, except public which bankrupt the states and cities as the tax base is otherwise gone(through job export or legal tricks). I did an MBA by correspondence in 90s, was inspired by Nafta, Asean and other trade agreements, globalization, free trade. We now know that the rising tide raises all boats is wrong. As long as one country has a tax loophole, lower social or environentsl protection then all production will move there. Funny was the closing of a German Nokia factory to send to Romania. The workers in Romania callec in often sick, apparently they were taking care of their dachas, animals. Sounds like preppers here, one foot in system, one out. When the capitalists think workers are cheap somewhere, maybe it is because they have regressed to an earlier state so slave work mentality is gone. These people are self reliant. <br><br>1977 was several years before the 20 year regular conjunction of saturn-jupiter. In such times energy, new ideas in a society are gone. We are rumnng on a repetition of ideas fron the start of the phase. We see that nowadays clearly. Everything in the world springs from the source of the 9/11 crisis and the security mind set it engndered. Reagan era was free trade,"tear that wall down". Now both are coming together. USA TPTB want global control desperately but it is beyond their grasp. What they learned from previous eras, coups, dirty tricks will be used against them.<br><br>We are going into the downward phaseuntil 2020 shock conjunction. This is when society gets elecroshocked out of its lethargy by new and unexpected energies and events in general, music, movies, politics. We will see if progress will be redefined in terms of collapse named in article or self control of penible german mind set or simply doing without self reliance of romanians, russians. I suspect America as bull in china shop is making no friends. Its concept, described by JMG, Reagan, Chicago boys ideas are at their end.

Add this to the rights of primogeniture encoded to ensure that real estate passed to the eldest son, and you find hundreds of thousands of people with no other option than to accept subsistence wages.

That disposes us to exploration and travel. An intelligent mushroom species would collect resources by staying put and modifying its immediate environment to suit its needs. An intelligent symbiont would not dream of going anywhere without its partner. Among such species and many others interest in physical exploration will be a rare trait and one that is not regularly rewarded. Their cultures are not likely to back exploration to the extreme of building starships.<br><br>Psychological quirk #2: For millions of years, human beings have stared into the night sky and wondered about the lights up there. Are they pinpricks in a metal bowl with light shining through from the other side, or separate fires, and how far away are they? Do the patterns mean anything? <br><br>We can go out in the dark sometimes without dying, we have sense organs that can detect some wavelengths of stellar radiation and distinguish one source from another, we don't live under the sea or inside rocks or under permanent cloud cover or a canopy of vegetation without any breaks.

But in your outline, I'd like to posit a point "g."<br><br>g) In a market economy, all participants are compelled to externalise as many costs as possible. Usually, it's the providers of goods, services and capital that seem to get the upper hand and, in competition with each other, adopt ever more complex technology that externalise more and more costs. Eventually, the one who externalises the most costs wins, resulting in business monopolies or near-monopolies, and tha pauperisation of the masses -- and the middle classes. This process appears to work in command and control societies, too. Example: the Soviet Union.<br><br>Now on to blivets: did you know that the industrial manufacture of these things results in the creation of Black Holes as waste, I. e., millions and millions of microscopic Black Holes? Yes, for someone from another set of dimensions appeared to me last night, showed me a typical M. C. Escher blivet, and said that his world met an apocalypse, as the quadrillions, quintillions and even gillions of the waste Black Holes finally merged as one, and consumed everything in sight. Luckily for this person, he created a dimension transfer machine (or so he says) and got out just in the nick of time. He also reported that right before he left, everyone heard the cry, "O Joy Unbounded!" just before everything started to disappear.<br><br><a href=the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html#c610680569005276177 title="comment permalink">2/27/15, 8:54 AM</a><br><br>

No, you didn't. And I didn't mean to imply you did either. Sorry for the misunderstanding.<br><br>Let me explain. After reading the statement in question, it seemed likely to me that there was a causal relationship. So I began drafting my comment to demonstrate that increased technological complexity did in fact cause increased externalities. Half way through, I realized I couldn't do it. Of course, you were not specifically making such a point in the first place. Nonetheless, it is true that some technologies do indeed facilitate externalizing the stuff (physical and otherwise) no one wants and the existence of this technology goes hand in hand with the creation of the bad stuff in the first place. <br><br>The best I could do towards demonstrating technology causes externalities was to show that if an increase in technological complexity involved using more energy (and often it does), then we can expect more bad stuff. To be more accurate: increased energy use (without compensating increased thermodynamic efficiency) always leads to creating more stuff no one wants. This stuff is then “externalized” by those in a position to do so. They are in a position to do so precisely because they have the tools, i.e. the tech, to do it. Its only at that point that the bad stuff becomes an “externality”. So in this sense, your “technological complexity tends to make increased externalities possible” is certainly correct.<br><br>In truth, nothing can really be completely externalized though it can be put out of sight and out of mind for a time by those who don't want to perceive it or have it harm them immediately. Even using the terms “externalized” and “externalities” feels wrong. No being is separate from the biosphere. Such words as “externalized” and “externalities” are part of the language of the dark one.<br><br>Oh! The dump is open tomorrow.

I had spent the days after your previous post thinking about the costs (externalities) loaded into our economic system. To see you take it up as this weeks post was a nice surprise. I had been thinking of these costs, that we and the environment pays, as subsidies benefiting the manufacturers, and had come to the conclusion that capitalism, and it's earlier iterations, never worked without them. The system 'works' because it is subsidized at every level; by cheap or slave labor, by cheap resources usually stripped away from somewhere other than where they are consumed and of course by your example of pollution and degradation of the environment. Capitalism is not and has never been sustainable.<br><br>In my mind I had seen the externalities as a problem of our system, which never wants to pay the tab for anything, and not as an inherent result of increasing complexity in technology. I do agree that if the true cost of our complex gadgets were paid by the consumer then the consumer would find a more appropriate and less costly technology to get their tasks done. <br><br>The computer is a good example. An item that was once quite expensive and built in relatively small numbers which, through subsidies, is now cheap, over consumed and utilized for mostly silly purposes. I've read many times that the number one use of computer devices is to access the internet for porn. The number two use must certainly be social media and dating sites to help people hook up. Do we really need such complex tech for these purposes? There is plenty of low tech available to help someone become aroused or to acquire a mate. But... is the computer not an appropriate technology in certain instances? Especially if the costs are not externalized? In reality the computer is not a toy, but that is how it is largely consumed. <br><br>I recently read 'The Beak of The Finch' by Jonathan Weiner, on evolution, and the data collected for their research couldn't have been sorted through and understood without a computer. Data collected by soil scientists and climate scientists require computers to crunch the numbers. There are hundreds of examples. For me, science, medicine and the acquisition of knowledge has value. It's our obsession with commoditizing everything, the belief that something only has a value if it can be sold, that is a problem. National forests were only worth the value of their timber until it was demonstrated that they had monetary value for ecotourism and didn't need to be chopped down to be consumed. But for me, both of these views of the forest ignore it's other, non-monetary values. Both views arise out of capitalism, which reduces everything to a consumptive evaluation. <br><br>Technology is no different than a forest in respect to being relinquished into the hands of of a capitalist (or in the hands of the other political systems that exist today). While more complex tech may have higher costs, that is in itself not an absolute argument against them. In appropriate quantities, for appropriate uses, many complex technologies would be worth their higher costs. Your own measure of if the costs of the tech are worth their benefits seems logical to me. Certainly computers incorporated into our mating and courting rituals will fall by the wayside, but maybe some computers will survive in centers of learning for the benefits they provide.<br><br><a href=the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html#c1940297687934898868 title="comment permalink">2/27/15, 11:35 AM</a><br><br>

I haven't read every comment yet, but I do have to add my voice to a few small critiques.<br><br>First, I think you are absolutely on to something here. The theory is sound, it makes logical sense, and it has strong explanatory power. This is some serious next-level kind of stuff - the stuff that can be put onto one page, that everyone can understand, and yet can change the way whole societies think. I really do think that this idea, if expressed correctly, is a "Declaration of Independence" or "Glass-Steagall" type of idea. It captures in one small argument huge swathes of the problems we all see in modern industrial civilization. So kudos to you. I critique after this in hopes of helping to refine a great notion.<br><br>There are two distinctions that absolutely must be made here, one of which Mark brought up first. This trend is, as you said, not always true. But this needs to be specified and narrowed. <br><br>The example that first came to mind for me, at least, was the cotton gin. This is ironic, given that it had exactly the sort of terrible consequences that you criticize here, but there is nothing inherent to it that would cause this. It was not more resource intensive than previous technologies and did not produce additional waste. There is, in fact, a whole category of technologies that don't fit this model. You may categorize them all as "simple" technologies, and I'd largely agree with you, but there has to be a distinction made here.<br><br>There are two options that come to mind. First, you could try to narrow down the terms you're defining such that one and only one category of technologies are included, but I don't know the term for that or where the boundaries are drawn. My guess is there is some fundamental line that can be found, but it would require some thought.<br><br>Your other option would be to add a human element to the idea; the cotton gin et al. do not of themselves have these effects, but increases in efficiency through technology leads to centralization or exploitation, that does. So the consequences are the same regardless. An additional explanation for how this would factor in would be required, though, and it muddies the waters a bit.<br><br>Secondly, I love the term "externalities of scale," and think that this adequately explains a good 90% or more of our current system's pseudo-growth and economic structure. But again, I think it must be admitted that economies of scale do exist and can exist. Yet here I think a distinction can easily be made; real economies of scale are NOT the product of technology, but of non-technological forces. Economies of scale are a product of better organization, efficient system structuring, the existence of market power, and so on.<br><br>I'd love to discuss it more in-depth with you, but I'd guess you're quite swamped. I just think this is a brilliant idea that, with a little refinement, could be a game-changer. If you have the time, feel free to email me, otherwise I look forward to your response here.<br><br><a href=the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html#c8095376172876340068 title="comment permalink">2/27/15, 12:54 PM</a><br><br>

Maybe you already offer that option (I can't tell because traffic from your comment appears to have brought your site down). Your current typical retail customers might not appreciate that option, but I bet the potential customers from this site (for instance) would.<br><br>If I were a local retail customer, I'd also appreciate an option to get containers refilled or return them for a small refund (remember "deposit" beverage bottles?), but to get the retailers cooperating with that you'd have to internalize <i>their</i> externalities, i.e. compensate them for the costs and effort of collecting trade-ins and getting them back to you.<br><br>@indus56: I like the thinking in your comments. I've found that assessing the true internalized cost (or just the energy cost) of anything is fiendishly difficult. Security, roads, universities, and all the other elements you mentioned do have to be taken into account, but their costs also have to be (somehow) apportioned among all their uses, or else you quickly reach the conclusion that the true internalized cost of a box of paper clips from the stationery store is the entire gross world product. (Which might be true in some vague poetic sense, but not very useful for comparison or decision making).<br><br>As far as I've been able to tell so far, most U.S. food prices "internalized" would be about double what they are, manufactured consumer goods about triple, and fuels a bit higher than that, so your concerns about the real internalized viability of natural gas conversion are valid. Arriving at firmer numbers would be a massive undertaking, unless there are tools available that I've overlooked.<br><br>@all the "squirrely intellects" in attendance: I'm impressed too, but not surprised.<br><br><a href=the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html#c3594964293700636551 title="comment permalink">2/27/15, 1:03 PM</a><br><br>

It rings true because I've experienced this phenomenon on a time-scale a little easier for an individual human to grasp.<br><br>As a tech startup grows, it splits into divisions and departments, and a focus on "keeping track" of costs takes place, ostensibly to keep people honest. One of the results when the so-called bean counters move in is not so much a reduction of costs, but increased externalization <b>within the company itself</b>. Infrastructure of all kinds tends to be crushed out, from the quality of facial tissue in the office cabinet to the support libraries that make complex software easy to write and manage, because the costs of not doing those things well are harder to measure.<br><br>The end result is very nice looking ledger sheets and miserable employees. More than that, it erodes the capability of the company to do what it is supposed to be doing, resulting in lost profits and a spiral of increased attempts to measure certain costs until so many costs are externalized from any one department or individual that noone can get anything done. The company then collapses, the people split off, and start new companies to begin the cycle over again.<br><br>The act of attempting to make costs legible and making decisions to reduce them without regard to the costs that can't be seen seems a core part of this process, as is the hubris implied ("All we need is to measure it better!"). <br><br>So lots of well-meaning people get on the treadmill to attempting ever-finer measurements of what is going on, a process which has its own set of diminishing returns, when what people really seem to need is a story or mythos that enables good behavior without having to measure every single effect of everything. (The fact that corporations grow increasingly "soulless" as part of this process seems to dovetail nicely.)<br><br><a href=the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html#c1562725064515102296 title="comment permalink">2/27/15, 3:04 PM</a><br><br>

Likely we will have them on the backside of peak technology as well, IMO.<br><br>I guess I don't buy the "technology made me do it" excuse (although it has allowed them/us to make things worse a lot more quickly). We got to where we are by allowing people with no moral compass free rein in our society. Even if you roll technology back to sharp sticks and clubs, without mechanisms to control this problem, I don't see how it doesn't happen yet again...<br><br><br><br><br><a href=the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html#c8459556083534279419 title="comment permalink">2/27/15, 7:31 PM</a><br><br>

Being green can be a hell of a lot of fun, for those of us who get the chance. I pity those who have already been buried under our collective externalized cost dumps. I doubt if anyone in Mumbai is going on a long hike, only because they feel like it.<br>What an extraordinary, frustrating, absurd, and tragic time we live in! Except for the most Paleolithic of us, we are all complicit in this growth and progress model that is really like an AI run amuck that nobody knows how to turn off: no political solution because anyone who speaks truth is marginalized as a dangerous lunatic, no economic solution because without endless growth the economy cannot work.<br>We have unleashed a growth system that must use up and destroy everything and everyone because that's what it was programmed to do and almost nobody wants to be without a "job." A phrase from Noam Chomsky comes to mind: "a philosophy of futility." <br>Maybe I'm oversensitive but when I first heard the term: "human resources" (was it the 80s?) it sounded creepy to me, like a subliminal way to get employees on the same level as coal or timber, something to be efficiently used up. I prefer the stodgy old term: "personnel."<br>What a fine mess we have made! <br>Nearly all discussion of "sustainability" I hear in person or in the media is about how we should sustain growth, not how we should stop it. It is impolite to say that feeding 9 to 15 billion people is improbable, that building large cities in the desert is insanity, that projecting American military power all over the globe while our infrastructure decays will doom us. <br>If we find more oil to keep it all going another 20 years it just enables the human population and environmental impact to grow bigger. It is like adding more lanes to an interstate highway: if you build it, more cars will fill it up.<br>I don't proselytize about our situation unless people show some openness to LESS. If they react with disbelief and revulsion when they hear I don't have a TV, for example, then any talk of externalized costs would be futile.<br>Would I be slipping into hyperbole, to suggest that our world is like Europe in the summer of 1914?<br><br><a href=the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html#c9006142939268484061 title="comment permalink">2/27/15, 7:48 PM</a><br><br>

For one thing this definition seems to require us to do something you warned about and cede the term "progress" to the the big corporates...<br><br><i>"A regulatory environment sufficiently strict to keep technology from accelerating to collapse would thus bring technological progress to a halt by making it unprofitable."</i><br><br>I refer to your previous conflation of "progress" as a religion, and as you mentioned in a previous post, religious zeal does not require financial reward. Also consider the "open source" movement, where quite sophisticated technology is developed in a decentralised way by volunteers.<br><br>Another point: the post and subsequent comments make a lot of the issue of complexity - as a bad thing. Complicated technologies are one part of it, but these complicated machines replace complexity in the industry that employs them.<br><br>So I argue that simplification is actually the enemy. The term used in business is "rationalisation". Banks, insurers, transport operators and retailers close their local offices to cut the costs. Customers are directed interact with the service via the relevant website. This simplification takes the form of the removal of a whole raft of middlemen. Businesses that were part of the community and could offer various bespoke services now offer only a streamlined selection of services. So the society not only copes with the same externalities as before but loses the secondary economic benefits of a large cadre of locally based company staff.<br><br>To use the given example, the artisan blivet maker working out the home was providing cash to supplement an already complex domestic economy with food growing in the back garden, the missus darning socks, and lots of barter with other households for products, services and skills. <br><br>The billet factory by contrast is a big building for one purpose only. The transactions are accordingly simplified to the minimum required monetary transactions with the material suppliers, and the customers of the product, the payroll, and the odd trade to maintain the building and plant. <br><br>This simplification is perhaps responsible for the pollution issues. In a production process modelled more on an ecosystem, waste heat may be used for district heating. CO2 makes tomatoes in greenhouses grow. Maybe blivet waste has its uses. But in the quest for simplification of the balance sheet the opportunities to work symbiotically with other businesses is lost.<br><br><a href=the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html#c9123157015362058945 title="comment permalink">2/28/15, 7:31 AM</a><br><br>

Of things since _We Were Never Modern_, there is _The Politics of Nature (2004)_, mentioned earlier, but also--and I would be pleased to see an essay of yours arising from--"Will humans be saved, an argument in ecotheology" (2009).<br><br>One of the more helpful alternatives or antidotes to the tediously self-congratulatory atheism of modern Western intellectual life is Latour's criticism of its loss of expressive / interpretive capacity in spiritual matters:<br><br>" And yet, it remains extremely difﬁcult to <br>apply to religion the same principle that has been applied to the other contrasts, that is, <br>to treat it on its own ground so as not to speak ‘of ’ religion but instead to speak ‘in’ a <br>religious tone, or, using the adverbial form, religiously. Speaking scientiﬁcally is not a <br>problem, especially for a scholarly profession like ours. Speaking legally is taught very <br>efﬁciently at law schools – and God knows how speciﬁc is this way of speaking. But <br>enunciating something religiously is terribly difﬁcult because of the ease with which it <br>is explained or accounted for by other types of explanation, especially social explana- <br>tions. The precise truth conditions (or felicity conditions) that allow someone to speak <br>religiously (and not ‘about’ religion in another tone of voice) have almost vanished (the <br>same is true, by the way, of political enunciation)." (Latour, 2009, p. 461).<br><br>How he brings this to bear on the "strange question" of ecotheology is a breath of fresh air (and I say this as a interested agnostic), and resonates with some of your writings on the sickening of Western science (if I can put it that way):<br><br>" It is deﬁnitely not the case that science is about the concrete, worldly, matter of fact, present at <br>hand, domain of knowledge in addition to which another vehicle called ‘religious belief ’ would lead you to a ‘supernatural’ domain of spiritual entities. If anything, it is science which is an excellent vehicle to transport you to otherworldly domains which would be utterly inaccessible without the carefully arrayed chains of reference allowed by its more and more complex instrumentarium (and I hasten to add, to make sure I am not misunderstood, that these sets of mediations are made more and more accurate, sturdy, safe, and fully trustable every day); it is religion that attempts to access // the this-worldly in its most radical presence, that is you, now, here transformed into the person who cares about the transformation of the indifferent other into a close neighbour, into the nearby, into le prochain (Latour 2005b).

Could a society based on a competitive ethos derived (or causing, it is hard to tell) from a market economy indefinitely sustain sufficient political equality to restrain technological complexification? Can a society that does not guarantee general equality in property indefinitely prevent the rise of a competitive ethos and market dependence that leads to political inequality sufficient to undo the attempt at stabilizing or rewinding technological progress?<br><br> I doubt it. I'd guess that an indefinitely sustainable society will require an ecologically cooperative ethos and some kind of common control of production and distribution of needed goods and services. But also, once the needs of Life are met well enough to ensure the political equality needed to sustain social control of technological progress and therefore sustain the society itself, the needs of Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness can perhaps be met by a market economy in uneeded things. To explain succinctly, imagine a society where the technoprogress ceiling is set on various productions at various levels - such as time period for simplicity, but actually externalities of cost and waste - but beneath that, innovation is allowed, even encouraged, both in commonly controlled production to ensure basic needs and general equality, and privately controlled production to pursue individual or group happiness. Such a society need not be stifling to the individual or collective spirit even as it is restrained enough to be indefinitely sustainable. Mix in a disciplined, collapse-conscious, preservationist subculture or three and things are looking real good. <br><br>As long as that ecologically cooperative ethos holds up that is. And can such an ethos actually outcompete anthropocentric competition without a seriously nasty global collapse and what we might call a real dark age?

No, it's the air travel industry externalizing its costs at the expense of its customers' health -- a very common practice these days in most industries. <br><br>Blue Sun, good. Of course we can't actually externalize anything; it's the economic fiction that we can do so, and should do so, because it doesn't really matter, that's driving our civilization to ruin. <br><br>Moshe, yes, I saw that. What a bright idea! Glowing with enthusiasm, even...<br><br>Ed-M, and everyone else tried to escape via <a href=http://www.mcescher.com/gallery/impossible-constructions/ascending-and-descending/ rel=nofollow>emergency stairs</a>.<br><br>J Thomas, well, yes, that's why I used "tends" in my discussion. <br><br>Agent, fair enough. To my mind, it's important to recognize that the drive to generate externalities is part of economic behavior; technology just enables that behavior, and progressing technology means that there's an ever-increasing supply of things to externalize. <br><br>SV Koho, if my theory holds, the process will go on until the degradation of the whole system stops it. The question is purely how soon that point arrives. <br><br>Daergi, that's why -- as I noted to Agent Provocateur -- it's crucial to remember that economic forces, not just patterns intrinsic to technology, guide the deployment of technology. If not for pictures of people with their clothes off, the internet would never have been able to pay for itself, much less expand to its current metastatic condition. Whether computers are useful tools for scientific research is frankly a less important question than whether a society can afford the immense investment in infrastructure needed to produce and maintain computer technology if the only people who use it are scientific researchers. <br><br>Derv, here again, it's crucial to factor in the economic sphere. Did the cotton gin require the production of externalities? No, but it made new externalities possible -- and the economic sphere saw to it that the new possibilities were exploited. Even very simple technologies can do that, given the right economic conditions -- or the wrong ones. As for economies of scale, of course there are some, but there are also a lot of externalities of scale, and it would require a very close study of a lot of data to sort out how many actual economies of scale there are. My guess is that they're actually fairly rare, but that's just a guess. <br><br>As for your post last week, I'm not at all sure why Blogger ate it -- a lot of people post links all the time, and I certainly didn't delete it. as I mentioned when you asked. <br><br>Michelle, good.

Never having worked in the tech field, I don't have any personal experience of the process, but your description makes perfect sense. I've noticed how Google's slogan "Don't be evil" somehow morphed to "Go ahead, be evil -- it's good for the bottom line." <br><br>Joe, thanks for this! I'm surprised I didn't see it earlier. If that analysis is correct, we know for a fact that industrial civilization is self-terminating: if none of the 20 biggest industries in the world would make any money without dumping their costs on the biosphere, then in whole-system terms, none of them actually creates more wealth than they destroy -- they just steal from the future, and when that future arrives, they're toast. Thanks also for the link about the <i>Nature</i> study, which I had read of. <br><br>Janet, that's a great example. <br><br>Steve, you're missing one of the core parts of the argument. Of course technologies all involve some degree of externalization; so do your bowels and bladder, for heaven's sake. The point is that whole systems can generally work around a steady state production of externalities. It's technological progress, the ongoing and unlimited increase in technological complexity (and thus in demand for resources and production of waste), that generates the rising tide of externalities that eventually causes whole systems to degrade to the point of collapse. Once you no longer have progress, you no longer have that accelerating dynamic. <br><br>Other Tom, I loathe the term "human resources." What do you do with resources? You exploit them, of course!<br><br>Heather, please do get started raising chicks! You may have yourself a nice source of springtime income, among other things. <br><br>Mark Rice, if you haven't already, see if you can find a copy of JK Galbraith's book <i>The Culture of Contentment</i>, which draws quite a close parallel between France before the Revolution and the US today. <br><br>Cherokee, dumping financial costs on everyone else is the only way the banking industry can make money these days, so yes, they're doing it. As for the way the civilian-military relationship worked in <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i>, I based that on the way the US has handled every war since the second invasion of Iraq. Yes, it's a bad idea, and will probably end up costing this country in blood. Glad to hear about those onions -- it's certainly worth a try!<br><br>Matthew, what is this "ladder of evolution" you're talking about? Evolution is just adaptation to circumstances, with no teleology or innate direction. <br><br>Ron, you got in under the wire (of the squirrel cage)! As for your bone, it actually doesn't matter which mode of production yields more waste; the question is which one makes it easier for the manufacturer to externalize the waste rather than dealing with it and absorbing the costs himself.<br><br>Squizzler, I think you've missed the thrust of my argument in general, but you have a useful point about complexity. Notice, though, that what's happening is that technological complexity is being used to further social simplification -- and thus load social costs onto society as a whole. <br><br>Indus56, I'd forgotten entirely about his discussion of ecotheology!

As for the claim that maximizing entropy is hardwired into living things, it's abject nonsense -- any first year ecology textbook will show you that those ecosystems that endure are those that maximize negentropy, using the flow of energy to squeeze out as much complexity as thermodynamics will permit. <br><br>Derv, I'm watching that closely.

I think it would be useful to make another distinction, between production (of crops, extractive commodities, manufactures and services) for local and regional markets versus production for export or for sale in distant parts of one's own country.<br><br>One of the maxims of prevailing economic theory is that every country should identify products or commodities that it can produce more cheaply than any other country, organize its economy around production of those items for export, and import everything else. The result is supposed to be that the whole world will buy everything from its most efficient producer, and therefore at the cheapest price. Thus the free market produces general wealth. This idea is in contrast to older theoretical schools such as mercantilism, which favored protection of domestic manufacture from foreign competition by high tariffs.<br><br>Nations that voluntarily turn their economy over to production of a few things for export, or have that strategy forced on them by the World Bank, sacrifice resilience. They have all their eggs in one basket. If some other exporting nation finds a way to undercut the price, or the crops fail, or worldwide demand falls for some reason, the exporting country has no source of foreign exchange to buy what it cannot produce. When its exports are in demand, the exporting nation does not necessarily benefit very much because the more distant the market, the more power falls into the hands of middlemen who wind up raking off most of the profit.<br><br>Furthermore, international markets have no room for sentiment. One competes primarily on price, secondarily on consistent quality and timely delivery. Labor relations and environmental impact are irrelevant. It's the famous race to the bottom.<br><br>In contrast, those who make a living selling commodities, goods and services to the societies they live in cannot wholly isolate themselves and act from purely rational, which is to say selfish, economic reasons. They have social interactions with their suppliers and their customers. They have some reason to see that their employees are housed and paid enough to buy what they produce. Their communities expect them to be philanthropic. They are generally more accountable to local social, legal and religious norms.<br><br> Historically there were lots of relatively steady state market economies that only got major influxes of wealth if their rulers went in for conquest and looting (I'm looking at you, Hellenistic Period.) We don't have a lot of examples of preindustrial societies that had gradual technological development over a long period without massive ecological damage. The medieval period in Europe comes pretty close, lots of tech the Romans didn't think of or didn't bother to apply, but the rising European population did coincide with deforestation and extinction of most of the native wild megafauna.<br><br><a href=the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html#c3743937784152801713 title="comment permalink">3/1/15, 6:12 AM</a><br><br>

So, ideal actors regulated (not free) do not make up a free market (that is the point usually made by Libertarians) but more often than not, the actors are not “ideal.” It is a major failure of integration of economics theory and social theory to place the non-ideal parts in the category of “external costs” and ignore them.

They have some corporate support. They are simpler to administer than cap-and-trade schemes. Many large corporations are concerned about the economic effects of climate change and would like something done to slow it down, as long as that something doesn't put them at a competitive disadvantage.<br><br>Contrary to what you say, the tax on carbon has some support among liberals and a few conservatives. I expect the idea to gather political momentum because it's a direct action that is fairly simple to explain. People who are worried about climate change can get behind it and feel like they are doing something. Getting back a tax refund from the government is also popular. California's got a cap and trade law, but if we had it to do over, I think we'd go for a carbon tax.<br><br>Taxing other externalities will be a harder fight. I've read that Germany has a law that all manufacturers must accept their products back for recycling, which is an alternative to a recycling tax that gives manufacturers an incentive to design for long life and reuse of components. It would be great if that spread. Regulatory capture is always a problem in the U.S., but I don't know that enacting social goals through taxation has been any more effective. <br><br>Imposing tariffs on countries that don't tax externalities is also going to be difficult, because China puts economic development first and the free trade crowd has the upper hand in both major American political parties. <br><br>On the whole, I agree that restructuring the economy through internalizing externalities will not happen quickly enough to do much good.<br><br><a href=the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html#c5539846285773849619 title="comment permalink">3/3/15, 2:30 PM</a><br><br>

It's as good as anything I've come up with. In fact, I'm tempted to use it as a script for a stand alone lecture on the topic, which I would give with attribution by your permission. I suppose this could have been the TED Talk you were invited to present but never gave, as I recall you wrote that you turned down the invitation.<br><br>Just the same, there are two aspects to fully pricing externalities that you addressed in a different way than how most students, including mine, encounter the subject. I suspect that's because the authors of environmental science textbooks and the professors who use those books, tend to subscribe implicity or explicitly to the school of environmental economics instead of ecological economics. They realize that problems of pollution and resource depletion are important, but hope that solutions can be achieved by reforming the existing system instead of outside the system. These are the "bright green" types within the environmental movement that <a href=../../2014/01/a-bargain-with-archdruid.html rel=nofollow>you invited to make a bargain with you a year ago</a> by advocating conservation, decentralization, and rehumanization.<br><br>The first is a minor difference. You mentioned a regulatory environment that returned the externalities right into the sticker price of the technology. That would definitely work, but I found the mechanics of it rather vague. I do know one way to do it--taxes, which Mark Rice brought up. That's how European countries manage to raise the price of gasoline/petrol close to full price. The taxes are included in the sticker price that way. Advocating that seems to rely on a confidence in government that I see in the environmental economists but I generally find lacking in the ecological economists. The latter see government to be a major problem, almost as important as big business.<br><br>The second is a major difference. The environmental economists seem to see full-cost pricing as a means of spurring technological innovation in sustainable direction, one consistent with higher levels of technology as progress. I doubt most of them foresee that including externalities in the prices of technologies would actually cut off what they see as advances in technology. Won't they be surprised if that happens!<br><br>Finally, thanks for accepting <a href=http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2015/02/paean-to-power-of-poop-squirrel-case.html rel=nofollow>Paean to the power of poop, a Squirrel Case entry</a>.<br><br><a href=the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html#c4509100821761979980 title="comment permalink">3/3/15, 6:24 PM</a><br><br>

Abuse it and the soil will collapse and die, taking humanity with it”.<br><br>There’s no longer even an appetite for studying the problem. Just one university – Aberdeen – now offers a degree in soil science. All the rest have been closed down.<br><br>This is what topples civilisations. War and pestilence might kill large numbers of people, but in most cases the population recovers. But lose the soil and everything else goes with it.<br><br>- from "Ploughing On Regardless" 25 March 2015ce UK Guardian<br>http://www.monbiot.com/2015/03/25/3703/<br><br><a href=the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html#c7045238228041753481 title="comment permalink">3/29/15, 10:01 AM</a><br><br>
