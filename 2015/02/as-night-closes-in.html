<div class=MsoNormal>
I was saddened to learn a few days ago, via a phone call from a fellow author, that William R. Catton Jr. died early last month, just short of his 89th birthday. Some of my readers will have no idea who he was; others may dimly recall that I’ve mentioned him and his most important book, <i>Overshoot</i>, repeatedly in these essays. Those who’ve taken the time to read the book just named may be wondering why none of the sites in the peak oil blogosphere has put up an obituary, or even noted the man’s passing. I don’t happen to know the answer to that last question, though I have my suspicions. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I encountered <i>Overshoot</i> for the first time in a college bookstore in Bellingham, Washington in 1983. Red letters on a stark yellow spine spelled out the title, a word I already knew from my classes in ecology and systems theory; I pulled it off the shelf, and found the future staring me in the face. This is what’s on the front cover below the title: </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="margin-left: 35.45pt">

<div class=MsoNormal style="margin-left: 35.45pt">
<b>crash: </b>die-off. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If you want to know where I got the core ideas I’ve been exploring in these essays for the last eight-going-on-nine years, in other words, now you know. I still have that copy of <i>Overshoot</i>; it’s sitting on the desk in front of me right now, reminding me yet again just how many chances we had to turn away from the bleak future that’s closing in around us now, like the night at the end of a long day.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Plenty of books in the 1970s and early 1980s applied the lessons of ecology to the future of industrial civilization and picked up at least part of the bad news that results. <i>Overshoot</i> was arguably the best of the lot, but it was pretty much guaranteed to land even deeper in the memory hole than the others. The difficulty was that Catton’s book didn’t pander to the standard mythologies that still beset any attempt to make sense of the predicament we’ve made for ourselves; it provided no encouragement to what he called cargoism, the claim that technological progress will inevitably allow us to have our planet and eat it too, without falling off the other side of the balance into the sort of apocalyptic daydreams that Hollywood loves to make into bad movies. Instead, in calm, crisp, thoughtful prose, he explained how industrial civilization was cutting its own throat, how far past the point of no return we’d already gone, and what had to be done in order to salvage anything from the approaching wreck. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As I noted <a href=../../2011/11/gathering-of-tribe.html>in a post here in 2011</a>, I had the chance to meet Catton at an ASPO conference, and tried to give him some idea of how much his book had meant to me. I did my best not to act like a fourteen-year-old fan meeting a rock star, but I’m by no means sure that I succeeded. We talked for fifteen minutes over dinner; he was very gracious; then things moved on, each of us left the conference to carry on with our lives, and now he’s gone. As the old song says, that’s the way it goes. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s much more that could be said about William Catton, but that task should probably be left for someone who knew the man as a teacher, a scholar, and a human being. I didn’t; except for that one fifteen-minute conversation, I knew him solely as the mind behind one of the books that helped me make sense of the world, and then kept me going on the long desert journey through the Reagan era, when most of those who claimed to be environmentalists over the previous decade cashed in their ideals and waved around the cornucopian myth as their excuse for that act. Thus I’m simply going to urge all of my readers who haven’t yet read <i>Overshoot</i> to do so as soon as possible, even if they have to crawl on their bare hands and knees over abandoned fracking equipment to get a copy. Having said that, I’d like to go on to the sort of tribute I think he would have appreciated most: an attempt to take certain of his ideas a little further than he did. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The core of <i>Overshoot,</i> which is also the core of the entire world of appropriate technology and green alternatives that got shot through the head and shoved into an unmarked grave in the Reagan years, is the recognition that the principles of ecology apply to industrial society just as much as they do to other communities of living things. It’s odd, all things considered, that this is such a controversial proposal. Most of us have no trouble grasping the fact that the law of gravity affects human beings the same way it affects rocks; most of us understand that other laws of nature really do apply to us; but quite a few of us seem to be incapable of extending that same sensible reasoning to one particular set of laws, the ones that govern how communities of living things relate to their environments. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If people treated gravity the way they treat ecology, you could visit a news website any day of the week and read someone insisting with a straight face that while it’s true that rocks fall down when dropped, human beings don’t—no, no, they fall straight up into the sky, and anyone who thinks otherwise is so obviously wrong that there’s no point even discussing the matter. That degree of absurdity appears every single day in the American media, and in ordinary conversations as well, whenever ecological issues come up. Suggest that a finite planet must by definition contain a finite amount of fossil fuels, that dumping billions of tons of gaseous trash into the air every single year for centuries might change the way that the atmosphere retains heat, or that the law of diminishing returns might apply to technology the way it applies to everything else, and you can pretty much count on being shouted down by those who, for all practical purposes, might as well believe that the world is flat. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, as part of the ongoing voyage into the unspeakable in which this blog is currently engaged, I’d like to propose that, in fact, human societies are as subject to the laws of ecology as they are to every other dimension of natural law. That act of intellectual heresy implies certain conclusions that are acutely unwelcome in most circles just now; still, as my regular readers will have noticed long since, that’s just one of the services this blog offers. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s start with the basics. Every ecosystem, in thermodynamic terms, is a process by which relatively concentrated energy is dispersed into diffuse background heat. Here on Earth, at least, the concentrated energy mostly comes from the Sun, in the form of solar radiation—there are a few ecosystems, in deep oceans and underground, that get their energy from chemical reactions driven by the Earth’s internal heat instead. Ilya Prigogine showed some decades back that the flow of energy through a system of this sort tends to increase the complexity of the system; Jeremy England, a MIT physicist, has recently shown that the same process accounts neatly for the origin of life itself. The steady flow of energy from source to sink is the foundation on which everything else rests. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The complexity of the system, in turn, is limited by the rate at which energy flows through the system, and this in turn depends on the difference in concentration between the energy that enters the system, on the one hand, and the background into which waste heat diffuses when it leaves the system, on the other. That shouldn’t be a difficult concept to grasp. Not only is it basic thermodynamics, it’s basic physics—it’s precisely equivalent, in fact, to pointing out that the rate at which water flows through any section of a stream depends on the difference in height between the place where the water flows into that section and the place where it flows out. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Simple as it is, it’s a point that an astonishing number of people—including some who are scientifically literate—routinely miss. <a href=../../2010/02/energy-follows-its-bliss.html>A while back on this blog</a>, for example, I noted that one of the core reasons you can’t power a modern industrial civilization on solar energy is that sunlight is relatively diffuse as an energy source, compared to the extremely concentrated energy we get from fossil fuels. I still field rants from people insisting that this is utter hogwash, since photons have exactly the same amount of energy they did when they left the Sun, and so the energy they carry is just as concentrated as it was when it left the Sun. You’ll notice, though, that if this was the only variable that mattered, Neptune would be just as warm as Mercury, since each of the photons hitting the one planet pack on average the same energetic punch as those that hit the other. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s hard to think of a better example of the blindness to whole systems that’s pandemic in today’s geek culture. Obviously, the difference between the temperatures of Neptune and Mercury isn’t a function of the energy of individual photons hitting the two worlds; it’s a function of differing concentrations of photons—the number of them, let’s say, hitting a square meter of each planet’s surface. This is also one of the two figures that matter when we’re talking about solar energy here on Earth. The other? That’s the background heat into which waste energy disperses when the system, eco- or solar, is done with it. On the broadest scale, that’s deep space, but ecosystems don’t funnel their waste heat straight into orbit, you know. Rather, they diffuse it into the ambient temperature at whatever height above or below sea level, and whatever latitude closer or further from the equator, they happen to be—and since that’s heated by the Sun, too, the difference between input and output concentrations isn’t very substantial. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Nature has done astonishing things with that very modest difference in concentration. People who insist that photosynthesis is horribly inefficient, and of course we can improve its efficiency, are missing a crucial point: something like half the energy that reaches the leaves of a green plant from the Sun is put to work lifting water up from the roots by an ingenious form of evaporative pumping, in which water sucked out through the leaf pores as vapor draws up more water through a network of tiny tubes in the plant’s stems. Another few per cent goes into the manufacture of sugars by photosynthesis, and a variety of minor processes, such as the chemical reactions that ripen fruit, also depend to some extent on light or heat from the Sun; all told, a green plant is probably about as efficient in its total use of solar energy as the laws of thermodynamics will permit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What’s more, the Earth’s ecosystems take the energy that flows through the green engines of plant life and put it to work in an extraordinary diversity of ways. The water pumped into the sky by what botanists call evapotranspiration—that’s the evaporative pumping I mentioned a moment ago—plays critical roles in local, regional, and global water cycles. The production of sugars to store solar energy in chemical form kicks off an even more intricate set of changes, as the plant’s cells are eaten by something, which is eaten by something, and so on through the lively but precise dance of the food web. Eventually all the energy the original plant scooped up from the Sun turns into diffuse waste heat and permeates slowly up through the atmosphere to its ultimate destiny warming some corner of deep space a bit above absolute zero, but by the time it gets there, it’s usually had quite a ride. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That said, there are hard upper limits to the complexity of the ecosystem that these intricate processes can support. You can see that clearly enough by comparing a tropical rain forest to a polar tundra. The two environments may have approximately equal amounts of precipitation over the course of a year; they may have an equally rich or poor supply of nutrients in the soil; even so, the tropical rain forest can easily support fifteen or twenty thousand species of plants and animals, and the tundra will be lucky to support a few hundred. Why? The same reason Mercury is warmer than Neptune: the rate at which photons from the sun arrive in each place per square meter of surface. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Near the equator, the sun’s rays fall almost vertically.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Close to the poles, since the Earth is round, the Sun’s rays come in at a sharp angle, and thus are spread out over more surface area. The ambient temperature’s quite a bit warmer in the rain forest than it is on the tundra, but because the vast heat engine we call the atmosphere pumps heat from the equator to the poles, the difference in ambient temperature is not as great as the difference in solar input per cubic meter. Thus ecosystems near the equator have a greater difference in energy concentration between input and output than those near the poles, and the complexity of the two systems varies accordingly. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All this should be common knowledge. Of course it isn’t, because the industrial world’s notions of education consistently ignore what William Catton called “the processes that matter”—that is, the fundamental laws of ecology that frame our existence on this planet—and approach a great many of those subjects that do make it into the curriculum in ways that encourage the most embarrassing sort of ignorance about the natural processes that keep us all alive. Down the road a bit, we’ll be discussing that in much more detail. For now, though, I want to take the points just made and apply them systematically, in much the way Catton did, to the predicament of industrial civilization. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A human society is an ecosystem.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Like any other ecosystem, it depends for its existence on flows of energy, and as with any other ecosystem, the upper limit on its complexity depends ultimately on the difference in concentration between the energy that enters it and the background into which its waste heat disperses. (This last point is a corollary of White’s Law, one of the fundamental principles of human ecology, which holds that a society’s economic development is directly proportional to its consumption of energy per capita.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Until the beginning of the industrial revolution, that upper limit was not much higher than the upper limit of complexity in other ecosystems, since human ecosystems drew most of their energy from the same source as nonhuman ones: sunlight falling on green plants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As human societies figured out how to tap other flows of solar energy—windpower to drive windmills and send ships coursing over the seas, water power to turn mills, and so on—that upper limit crept higher, but not dramatically so. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The discoveries that made it possible to turn fossil fuels into mechanical energy transformed that equation completely. The geological processes that stockpiled half a billion years of sunlight into coal, oil, and natural gas boosted the concentration of the energy inputs available to industrial societies by an almost unimaginable factor, without warming the ambient temperature of the planet more than a few degrees, and the huge differentials in energy concentration that resulted drove an equally unimaginable increase in complexity. Choose any measure of complexity you wish—number of discrete occupational categories, average number of human beings involved in the production, distribution, and consumption of any given good or service, or what have you—and in the wake of the industrial revolution, it soared right off the charts. Thermodynamically, that’s exactly what you’d expect. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The difference in energy concentration between input and output, it bears repeating, defines the upper limit of complexity. Other variables determine whether or not the system in question will achieve that upper limit. In the ecosystems we call human societies, knowledge is one of those other variables. If you have a highly concentrated energy source and don’t yet know how to use it efficiently, your society isn’t going to become as complex as it otherwise could. Over the three centuries of industrialization, as a result, the production of useful knowledge was a winning strategy, since it allowed industrial societies to rise steadily toward the upper limit of complexity defined by the concentration differential. The limit was never reached—the law of diminishing returns saw to that—and so, inevitably, industrial societies ended up believing that knowledge all by itself was capable of increasing the complexity of the human ecosystem. Since there’s no upper limit to knowledge, in turn, that belief system drove what Catton called the cornucopian myth, the delusion that there would always be enough resources if only the stock of knowledge increased quickly enough. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That belief only seemed to work, though, as long as the concentration differential between energy inputs and the background remained very high. Once easily accessible fossil fuels started to become scarce, and more and more energy and other resources had to be invested in the extraction of what remained, problems started to crop up. Tar sands and oil shales in their natural form are not as concentrated an energy source as light sweet crude—once they’re refined, sure, the differences are minimal, but a whole system analysis of energy concentration has to start at the moment each energy source enters the system. Take a cubic yard of tar sand fresh from the pit mine, with the sand still in it, or a cubic yard of oil shale with the oil still trapped in the rock, and you’ve simply got less energy per unit volume than you do if you’ve got a cubic yard of light sweet crude fresh from the well, or even a cubic yard of good permeable sandstone with light sweet crude oozing out of every pore. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s an article of faith in contemporary culture that such differences don’t matter, but that’s just another aspect of our cornucopian myth. The energy needed to get the sand out of the tar sands or the oil out of the shale oil has to come from somewhere, and that energy, in turn, is not available for other uses. The result, however you slice it conceptually, is that the upper limit of complexity begins moving down. That sounds abstract, but it adds up to a great deal of very concrete misery, because as already noted, the complexity of a society determines such things as the number of different occupational specialties it can support, the number of employees who are involved in the production and distribution of a given good or service, and so on. There’s a useful phrase for a sustained contraction in the usual measures of complexity in a human ecosystem: “economic depression.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The economic troubles that are shaking the industrial world more and more often these days, in other words, are symptoms of a disastrous mismatch between the level of complexity that our remaining concentration differential can support, and the level of complexity that our preferred ideologies insist we ought to have. As those two things collide, there’s no question which of them is going to win. Adding to our total stock of knowledge won’t change that result, since knowledge is a necessary condition for economic expansion but not a sufficient one: if the upper limit of complexity set by the laws of thermodynamics drops below the level that your knowledge base would otherwise support, further additions to the knowledge base simply mean that there will be a growing number of things that people know how to do in theory, but that nobody has the resources to do in practice. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Knowledge, in other words, is not a magic wand, a surrogate messiah, or a source of miracles. It can open the way to exploiting energy more efficiently than otherwise, and it can figure out how to use energy resources that were not previously being used at all, but it can’t conjure energy out of thin air. Even if the energy resources are there, for that matter, if other factors prevent them from being used, the knowledge of how they might be used offers no consolation—quite the contrary. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
That latter point, I think, sums up the tragedy of William Catton’s career. He knew, and could explain with great clarity, why industrialism would bring about its own downfall, and what could be done to salvage something from its wreck. That knowledge, however, was not enough to make things happen; only a few people ever listened, most of them promptly plugged their ears and started chanting “La, la, la, I can’t hear you” once Reagan made that fashionable, and the actions that might have spared all of us a vast amount of misery never happened. When I spoke to him in 2011, he was perfectly aware that his life’s work had done essentially nothing to turn industrial society aside from its rush toward the abyss. That’s got to be a bitter thing to contemplate in your final hours, and I hope his thoughts were on something else last month as the night closed in at last. </div>

I have a shelf of books from that era close to my writing desk, as a useful corrective to hubris. <br><br>Angelus, not annoying at all -- in fact, I wrote <a href="http://www.llewellyn.com/product.php?ean=9780738713199" rel=nofollow>an entire book on the subject</a> a while back. The short version? The UFO phenomenon was manufactured by Air Force Intelligence in the late 1940s and 1950s to distract domestic and foreign observers alike from tests of wholly terrestrial aircraft of various kinds: high-altitude balloons early on, then spyplanes such as the U-2 and SR-71, spy satellites, early stealth planes -- do you recall when all of a sudden UFO watchers started seeing black triangles? Compare the dates to the history of the Stealth program and you can draw some interesting conclusions. <br><br>Now of course this means that "UFO technology" consists of a mix of wholly terrestrial technologies, smoke and mirrors from the spook industry, and the fantasies of those who've swallowed the bait, and so doesn't offer any solutions to the end of the age of cheap energy, but that's just one of those details, I suppose. <br><br>Ando, I'm glad Catton didn't have to live off his royalties!<br><br>William, thank you. That's good to hear. <br><br>LatheChuck, I didn't have time to weigh in on the telegraph internet discussion last week. Of course you were quite right that that won't work; what would happen instead is that I'd wire the week's essay to a weekly magazine publisher, who would print it in regional distribution hubs as part of the week's issue and get it to subscribers that way.

You've talked a lot about corn ethanol EROEI never being worthwhile thermodynamically, but for example Brazilian sugar cane ethanol has a more favorable EROEI. I don't see this discussed much at all, as cornucopians and doomers instead seem to prefer clubbing each other over the head over the promise and shortcomings of corn ethanol, because it's what they know. Corn ethanol is purely a product of politics and lobbying, though. If sugarcane grew in Iowa like it did in Brazil, you could take it to the bank we'd be subsidizing sugarcane ethanol instead and the numbers would probably look a bit different. Same thing with biodiesel. Oil palms for example are like 8 times as productive as soybeans from what I've read, but again, soybeans grow in Iowa while oil palms do not, therefore palm oil biodiesel is not on many people's radar. Algae could grow in Nevada, hey, let's talk about that instead even though it's vaporware. The common debates fairly reek of provincialism, but it is what it is.<br><br>I'm not trying to push the cornucopian party line that we're just a couple of tweaks from having Kuntsler's happy motoring forever, just rather curious what you think happens when the dominant narrative catches up to the idea of living within our thermodynamic limits, then takes it that step further to deciding that appropriating more of the earth's sunlight budget for our own purposes is an excellent idea. No orbital solar collectors, colossal algae tanks, Nevada-sized solar panel arrays, etc. required. Probably a lot less virgin rainforest after all is said and done, though.<br><br><a href=#c513855086816125370 title="comment permalink">2/4/15, 8:09 PM</a><br><br>

It also enchants people into thinking that both will also allow our civilization to escape the fate of the Western Roman Empire, decline and fall related to exhausting both the resource base and the belief system that supports our civilization.<br><br>As for the rest of Catton's lesson, I pass it on to my students as "The economy depends on society, which depends on the natural environment. That means that without a healthy natural environment, there is no society. Without society, there is no economy."

For a decade or two I have remarked to my wife, and anyone else who would listen, that the two most valuable subjects that anyone could ever study are Thermodynamics and Ecology. The first of these I learned in depth as a mechanical engineer and the second by pure chance as it was the only natural science class that fit in my schedule. <br> So I agree with you that these two disciplines are of the highest importance in understanding our current predicament but are rarely learned by most people. The only exposure most people get to these subjects is a superficial nod to thermo in high school physics and an even shorter exposure to ecology in Biology. <br> The thing I have been asking myself is if this a giant oversight by our educational system or is it intentional. Having too many people know too much about these two things might make pushing the religion of growth, technology and resource extraction more difficult.

The fact that you're aware of your own potentials for hypocrisy is a very big step. None of us are, or can be, pure, and pretending otherwise isn't a useful habit. The point is to move in the direction of LESS (less energy, stuff, and stimulation) and keep moving that way. <br><br>Hector, the issue that has to be worked out before that question can be answered is whether the rest of the whole system that uses liquid fuel can be supported on a biofuels basis, and if so, how large and complex of a system? That, more than the mere EROEI of the fuel, is going to determine just now much tropical real estate will be growing oil and/or ethanol crops in a deindustrial future. <br><br>James, thank you. <br><br>Pinku-sensei, well, of course I've said it before -- we're discussing some of the foundations of the thinking that goes into this blog, and as such, those points have been referenced repeatedly in various ways.<br><br><a href=#c288891410809063708 title="comment permalink">2/4/15, 8:53 PM</a><br><br>

The mythological thinking that undergirds modern industrial culture demands that humanity progress endlessly toward omnipotence. Ecology and thermodynamics both tell us, in no uncertain terms, that that's a fool's errand, and bound to end badly. Thus those who believe the myth -- and human beings, even (or especially) in industrial societies, do far more of their thinking with mythic narratives than contemporary culture is willing to admit -- are going to ignore or reject ecology and thermodynamics whenever they think they can get away with it, since the ignorance and rejection allows them to keep cognitive dissonance at a minimum. That's where proposing new narratives, and new (or old) ways of looking at human existence, are crucial parts of the work -- it's only when people have learned how to tell different stories about themselves that they'll be able to handle seeing those things the currently popular stories can't face.<br><br><a href=#c4834855191397638960 title="comment permalink">2/4/15, 8:59 PM</a><br><br>

It's just occurred to me: the solar panel in the arctic will probably receive less solar energy than the same panel in the tropics, because of the obliquity of the atmosphere. Sunlight at the equator - hence overhead - has less atmosphere to pass through than in the arctic, where it must penetrate the atmosphere at a shallow angle. I wonder how much difference it makes, as a percentage of total energy intake?<br><br><a href=#c6529023396718855284 title="comment permalink">2/5/15, 12:10 AM</a><br><br>

I was left wondering whether Catton was a reader of Edmund Burke. Catton would have likely agreed with Burke. Burke was basically pretty skeptical of human reason. He noted its advantages, but Burke recognized the risk is not necessarily to suppress human reason, but to let it run out of control. <br><br>An energetic superabundance seems to let us throw caution to the wind: this has been done, and our energy source, like a drug, is now in charge, and as a society we are about as effective as a junkie or a pet at dealing with life. I have no mind to go back to monarchy or much of what Burke might have embraced as traditional, but his analysis of the psychology of the French Revolution, on which all subsequent revolutions have been based, is pretty telling. <br><br>It seems often to be the case that much of the cornucopian thinking comes from those on the leftward edge of the political spectrum. That stands to reason, since Justice tends to be the left's standard, whereas Order for the right, and essentially the Enlightenment and Ages of Revolution - monuments to Reason - have been paid for by increasing territorial expansions...conquest of two continents, then theft of populations from a third to work the land of the two; and ultimately the theft of ecological balance on a global scale, when fossil fuels blundered their way into the scene in a really unanticipated way. I really think fossil fuels was totally unexpected - but strangely, fossil fuels may have not been discovered if the Revolutions had not come first?? If the new worlds had not been discovered first, bringing the expectation of floods of wealth...<br><br>Anyway, Catton for an ecologist spends a considerable bit of time in Overshoot digesting the detritus of Revolution. Now most scientists tend to stay in their domain, it is a credit to Catton's bravery to address the subject of revolutions in an ecological context - but also perhaps part of why he is ignored. It's controversial. Let the kids deal with it.<br><br>But now both Justice and Order are basically being upheld by economic abundance...for a time... both the Right and Left have gone "All-In" as the poker players say, on the abundance. If it is not a new technology, SOMETHING is hoped for: the Great Awakening. The Great Transformation. some final human Revolution. So, new age magical thinking of this kind is predominantly a manifestation of the political left...<br>On the right, Order is pretty straightforward. History tends to Entropy and the right wants to keep something of what was. Regardless, both sides can call the purpose, whether Order or Justice, whatever they want.. It always tends to be rather abstract, and on further inspection outside of certain boundaries, basically a call for Justice or for Order become signals to consume the abundance... form matters less than use... as the energy flows through the increasingly ossified system, the society hardly understands the words it's saying anymore. It is all ritual with no content. It is quite like a senile elderly person.<br><br>And on these terms, there is nothing left to do. Read Orlov's column today for an example. I'm inclined to agree - just relax a bit. If anything, perhaps our problem is too much industry, however it's powered.<br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c8804947611461242676 title="comment permalink">2/5/15, 1:06 AM</a><br><br>

I think there might be something wrong about the whole idea that, "we could have done something about this mess(on a large scale)" if we had started years and years ago. I see this oft expressed in peak oil circles, but it seems to fly in the face of reason and history for that matter. There seems to be mechanisms and feedback loops that keep this sort of soft landing phenomena from happening, unless you hit the cultural lottery of belief systems as happened with soft collapses of certain Japanese Dynasties. <b>Is it an intellectual cop-out to say there is no reason to feel sadness that everyone didn't buckle down and embrace the simplicity of a low energy lifestyle?</b> I could list feedback loops in the political, social, and religious spheres that all worked against this sort of thing ever becoming a reality (on a large scale). Metaphorically, I often see the entire course of civilization in making, lighting and watching a campfire smolder all the way to ashes. Should it make me sad or frustrated that a we didn't set aside a few logs so that the fire burned more evenly on its way out? The industrial world really is an ecosystem, But do I judge the Lioness for eating the gazelle, or hold contempt for the mosquito's methods of survival? <br><br>This sort of melancholy tone is in my opinion a curse to the legitimacy of the peak oil, limits to growth scene (a bit of dark magic ;) ), that ends in a cycle of self defeating misery. Unless the scene is trying to martyr, Man the conqueror of nature, then I think that this belief hurts way more than it helps.

I've commented before I think that I don't recall back then a framed choice between ecological common sense or over-exuberance. At the time for me, as a confused teenager, the choice seemed to be served up as political one of failing state socialism vs a return to vigorous enterprise and capitalism. That's was Thatcher's thing in 1979, at least. I wonder if she (and Reagan) actually understood the choice in those ideological terms, or whether she knew the real the choice was as Catton and others described it? <br><br>Anyway, I think there is a very interesting history book to be written about those years, with a focus on how the choices we faced back then were framed and why society chose as we did. And what the consequences have been. <br><br>We're going through the same confronting of reality now of course, but this time the choice can't be framed in terms of left vs right, because governments are mostly all some version of growth capitalism across the world. <br><br>Finally, around the last time you mentioned Catton I believe another commenter mentioned one of my favorite TV shows from back then - the UK's "The Good Life". It's still a great thing to watch on YouTube and gives a glimpse of how these topics were handled by the BBC at the time. It tells of an upper middle class executive going back to the land in London suburbia, but not because of impending ecological overshoot - rather because he was tired of the corporate rat race.<br><br><a href=#c3717394440875118765 title="comment permalink">2/5/15, 6:28 AM</a><br><br>

This week I attended a work shop for business owners and emergency managers to plan adaptive strategies to climate change, which here in New England means getting ready for extreme precipitation events. The meeting took place in a Gold Certified LEED factory with a global supply/distribution chain. Very fancy. They were proudly working on reducing their CO2 footprint and composting food scraps from the staff kitchen. The keynote came from a climatologist at a prestigious college who concluded that “we” would without doubt tackle the CO2 problem “in due time” through geo-engineering (no details on what that would look like, of course). Then we work shopped on how to make area businesses more resilient to flooding.

I still remember a science teacher once (8th or 9th grade) giving us a brain teaser about this. As near as I can recall it was something like – “You’re stranded on a barren little mountain-top with plenty of water and firewood, but nothing but your own supplies to eat. Your supplies consist of a live hen, a couple of boxes of corn flakes, and a case of canned soup. What do you do to spread your food supply as long as you can in order to survive until a rescue can get to you?” It seemed obvious to me that you’d better kill that chicken sooner rather than later and eat it up, since it was sitting there burning up your allotment of calories. But no one else seemed to get that. Many people just ate their stuff in no particular order. Some saved the chicken for last. The cleverer ones fed the corn flakes to the chicken for eggs before they ate the chicken. But the thing that stuck with me was they just didn’t get my take on it at all – they couldn’t see past the cornflakes and eggs to the abstraction of calories and thermodynamics. <br><br><br><a href=#c9058905391949266041 title="comment permalink">2/5/15, 8:20 AM</a><br><br>

My only minor quibble is where you say "a green plant is probably about as efficient in its total use of solar energy as the laws of thermodynamics will permit." This would be better stated something like "a green plant in a stable ecological niche will become as efficient in its total use of solar energy as possible." <br><br>I haven't looked at Jeremy England's work yet, but I think the book Into the Cool: Energy Flow, Thermodynamics, and Life by Eric D. Schneider covers this area pretty well if not proving it. The controlling factors are thermodynamics <i>and</i> life/evolution. <br><br>The consequence of this on biofuels is of course that one can't get a plant to produce a significantly higher energy output unless one can can control the parasites and predators without negatively impacting the symbionts. Any genetic engineering or chemical manipulation gains will be unsustainable because evolution isn't going to leave that extra energy alone. Obviously that means of controlling the parasites must use less energy than the gains. <br><br>Nothing new to this blog, just emphasizing some points.<br><br><a href=#c7624699144616101930 title="comment permalink">2/5/15, 8:53 AM</a><br><br>

Even people who should know better get stuck in the delusion that you can get something for nothing. As one example, I recently ran into someone whom I went through mechanical engineering school with. We had a chat about what we had been up to over the years. This person, whom I had actually sat next to in a university thermodynamics class, was telling me of a this 'invention' of a hydrogen injection system where the electricity of from the alternator of the car electrolyzes water to provide the hydrogen. I laughed and made a wisecrack about perpetual motions machines and such...only to realize that he was dead serious. After a few probing questions aimed at the thermodynamics of it all, I left the conversation just stunned. Another conversation I had with a Catholic engineer (who was working on child six, at the time) turned towards resource depletion. His response to my points about the finite nature of fossil energy resources was "God will provide". These two individuals "know" better, but this knowledge is completely unintegrated with their worldview. The fact that the dissonance hasn't prompted them to reexamine that worldview is disheartening, if these two folks educated in the sciences far beyond what you could expect from the average person, cannot connect the dots...ugh.<br><br><a href=#c7583297141730540867 title="comment permalink">2/5/15, 10:05 AM</a><br><br>

The reason your neighbor gets out better with his beam is that it's not unidirectional, all the energy is concentrated in a narrower beam instead of spreading out in all directions. However that beam still falls off the same with distance. That even applies to a beam as focused as a laser, it just is focused into a narrower beam.<br><br>Instead of being measured in degrees like the beam antenna, a laser beam's divergence is measured in milliradians. A milliradian is about 0.05 degrees. The beamwidth of a tpical Helium-Neon (HeNe) laser is around 1.0-1.5 milliradians. A solid-state laser is larger. Your laser pointer spot gets larger with distance, the concentration gets less as it's spread out over a larger area.<br><br>If there was a <i>perfect</i> beam that didn't diverge, then there wouldn't be the attenuation, however nobody has made such a beam.<br><br><a href=#c5880350454778657602 title="comment permalink">2/5/15, 12:04 PM</a><br><br>

On the front pages of the newspapers that adorn the front desks at work, in overheard conversations, and even in links posted on this blog. I’m sure you caught the article someone linked to near the end of last week’s discussion attempting to “debunk” peak oil using the “we’ll just keep inventing new technologies to drill deeper” argument last week. And that article included a link to an article that was attempting to “debunk” the very concept of ecological laws as applied to humanity right up to the basic concept on human carrying capacity using the fact that Malthus and other early thinkers on the potential for human overshoot had questionable motives and morally reprehensible ideas. In a lot of ways, it feels like we’re slipping right back into the 1980s mindset. Things seem to be teetering right now between imminent crisis on the one side and another (probably shorter) collective vacation from reality right now as discussions of peak oil and resource scarcity sinking back into the shadows.<br><br>As that happens, I do occasionally find myself in the back of my mind entertaining the question “what if the other side of the conversation is right and there’s more accessible oil than we think? Of course none of those people ever even in passing mention concepts like EROEI, and it’s always the same basic arguments that don’t hold up to 2 seconds of hard scrutiny. At the same time, I do occasionally feel the need to do those thought experiments… engage with the arguments I disagree with and ask myself how their being right would impact my decisions. I really don’t think it would. In a lot of ways, that leads to an even more terrifying future than the one we’ve been discussing here for the year this series has run as a fully powered society runs top speed into the limits of the planet’s biosphere. Whether this civilization loses momentum and grinds into crisis right now or holds its momentum for decades or centuries, this is a crucial time. If your New Year’s prediction was right, these may be the last years for a long while to do anything and still have a stable world to do it in, and even then there’ll be high stakes and seat of the pants improvising. If we’re going back into a period of extravagance and denial, this may be the last chance to preserve skills and lifestyles that are passing out of living memory with every year for the day when they’re needed again.<br><br>I do think that’s something that’s changed now from the 1970s… People are uneasy about the future and the implications of our civilization more than ever. Species are going extinct at an alarming rate, the planet is warming, people are more alienated and isolated than ever despite being in constant contact, and the few World Fair dreams that came true turned out to be dehumanizing, degrading nightmares. Overshoot is ceasing to be an abstract concept for many people today. There’ll always be people who opt out for what’s easy at the slightest hint of a choice. But it also seems that with every crisis that forces people to opt out of certain benefits of industrial life, there’s a larger group of people who just can’t bring themselves to opt back in when the opportunity comes. <br><br><br><a href=#c506193347062493266 title="comment permalink">2/5/15, 1:12 PM</a><br><br>

Not all societies collapse catastrophically -- in fact, there's a spectrum of possibilities from relatively smooth contraction all the way to face-into-the-concrete collapse. Had certain choices been made collectively at the end of the 1970s, we could have managed something closer to the smooth end of the spectrum; as it is, we're pedal to the metal, and the concrete wall's in sight. I think it's crucial to acknowledge that, recognize the mistakes that were made, and do our best not to repeat them on a smaller scale in our own lives and communities. We still have choices to make, and the insistence that our choices are preordained to disaster isn't especially useful in that context, you know. <br><br>Yupped, I don't know enough about Thatcher to be sure, but I'm quite sure Reagan didn't have a clue. He was a washed-up movie actor playing a role, and that's about it. There were people in his administration who I suspect did know what was going down, but my read is that they had convinced themselves that there had to be another answer, that the unrestrained free market (blah blah blah) would somehow take care of it, or what have you. Such evasions were very common just then. <br><br>Adrian, we do indeed. That's one of the reasons I'm doing a lot with fiction just now. <br><br>Unknown, fascinating.

Kudos.<br><br>Here are a couple of other takes on the matter:<br><br>1. The population explosion that is the root of this problem was deliberately created by the rich because cheap labor. The 'cornucopian' myth did not come about as an act of madness or wishful thinking, but was deliberately fostered as cover for a policy of cheap labor and big profits through sustained growth. <br><br>Example: the Sierra Club used to have the position that rapid population growth was bad for the environment. Then a wealthy billionaire with an arguable stake in cheap labor donated (or perhaps, bribed) $100 million to the leadership of the Sierra Club if they would only stop talking about population growth in an intelligent manner.<br><br>This is just one example, but my point is this: both classical and Keynesian economists agreed that there were limits and that rapid population growth would create poverty. The change in this view starting around 1970 did not come about because of new data, careful analysis, or even wishful thinking. It was because the rich and powerful used their influence to corrupt public discussion.<br><br>Check the mainstream media: virtually any mention of a link between rapid population growth and anything bad - traffic congestion, availability of fresh water, etc. - is virtually forbidden.<br><br>2. You and I won't like it when civilization runs down - but the super rich will like it just fine. In imperial China most people lived miserable lives working very hard for very little food - but the landed aristocracy did very well. With 100 starving peasants competing for every job, both the economic and the social power of the elite is maximized ('shave your head and kiss my feet or you are fired and then you and your family will starve')<br><br>Conclusion: the coming collapse was all deliberate. And the rich are going to like it just fine. Affordable and docile labor forever! (Or at least, for a very long time). And perhaps some of this is our fault, for being cowed by baseless cries of 'racism' or 'you are a looney' or 'nobody believes that.'<br><br><a href=#c7003913201116438170 title="comment permalink">2/5/15, 3:32 PM</a><br><br>

I don't expect serious revolt to happen by itself -- but then it didn't happen by itself in Libya, Syria, or the Ukraine; the US bought and paid for it in those places, and I think it's very likely that other powers can play that same game here. <br><br>Martin, you'll get no argument there. If someone ever gets around to chronicling the attempt to bring about a green transition back in the 1960s and 1970s, there'll need to be a list of characters in front! That's not the kind of writing I do well, and I'm frankly too emotionally invested in the subject to do a good job of it anyway, but it's a history that needs telling; I hope someone tackles the project soon. <br><br>Lazerus, when you say "we shouldn't have to live like the Amish," what's the basis for that claim? Every attempt I've seen to make that case either finesses or flatly ignores the huge costs in real wealth -- that is to say, energy, labor, and resources, rather than paper money -- that would be needed to make that happen, even if renewable energy could provide the kind of highly concentrated energy needed in enough quantity to matter. Every real world test of renewable energy, furthermore, makes it clear that renewables won't do the job. <br><br>There are certainly some renewable technologies that can be integrated into a lower-tech setting -- solar water heating and solar ovens are two of my favorites -- but at this point, frankly, keeping a lifestyle as comfortable as the Amish have is probably going to be off the plate for a couple of centuries. Yes, I'm aware that's an unpopular thing to suggest, but frankly, I'm past caring. The universe is under no obligation to give us the lifestyles we want, and insisting that one more round of technological vaporware will surely save us all isn't a useful habit at this stage of the game. <br><br>Ed, nah, we're just the current climax predator. Carnosaurs in their day absorbed, directly or indirectly (by way of food comsumed by prey species), a pretty fair proportion of the photosynthetic production of the areas where they hunted. When we go, whether that's soon or late, other species will take over the top-of-the-food-web niche. <br><br>PO, good. I've been arguing for years now that Fermi's Paradox isn't a paradox; it's proof that limitless technological progress is not an option for intelligent species anywhere in the universe. I suspect each intelligent species burns through whatever concentrated energy sources it can get, and then either dies out (if it bungles the transition badly enouugh) or, having finished its adolescence, reaches maturity as a species and does more interesting things thereafter. <br><br>Eric, there's been a real effort to push 1980s-style cornucopian thinking -- have you read the steady drumbeat of denunciations of peak oil in the media? -- and it's having its effect. The only difficulty in the way is that things are going wrong too quickly; where the surge in petroleum production after the 1970s crisis lasted for twenty years, the fracking boom peaked in five, and climate change is becoming very hard to ignore. It's possible, as I've noted before, that we're on the brink of a sea change of some magnitude, in which a lot of currently accepted ideas get hauled off to the glue factory and some ideas that have been exiled to the fringes for a long time find their way back in from the cold. Still, we'll see. <br><br>Ruben, thank you!<br><br>David, exactly.

Did you notice that I specified whole-systems analysis? If it takes Maxwell's demon more energy to detect the heated molecules than he could get by creating a differential between warm molecules in one tank and cool ones in another, as it necessarily would, you haven't conjured any energy at all -- you've just exchanged one form for another, with the usual losses to entropy. <br><br>Shane, does this mean I get to ride a bear? <br><br>Kyoto, no, I think you're right.

People are discussing whether we could have done something to avert this disaster, or whether failure was an inevitable outcome (either of our civilization's stage of collapse or simple human short-sightedness). Additionally, many people have been saddened or disturbed at the idea of decline, that all we have to look forward to is a collective decrease in wealth and scientific knowledge.<br><br>I can't help but be struck by the simple use of "we" for all these things, from myself included. There is an approach here that sees either our nation, Western civilization, or humanity collectively as "we," and then makes general statements regarding "us." It's a noble sentiment, surely, but I can't help but feel that the sadness of decline will be greatly blunted in the future by this "we" disappearing altogether.<br><br>For most of human history, there has been an in-group and an out-group; people cared about the collective welfare of their village/tribe/clan/kingdom, but only rarely humanity. A reversion to that is, I think, an inevitability given how much bigger the world will soon become. It's hard to see any connection at all between myself and, say, Parisians, when my only mode of speedy transport is a train and the internet no longer functions. It might as well be the moon to me. <br><br>So whatever sadness we feel at our collective decline will, I think, eventually be undone by the ordinary forces of history reasserting themselves (not that they went away, but I'm sure you catch my meaning). The collapse of industrial civilization will be to our descendants like the collapse of Rome - a tragedy, to be sure, but something the Romans did, not we Spaniards/French/Italians/Etc. Even in decline various peoples and places will have greatly differing fortunes, often at one another's expense. Humanity may be declining, but your future kingdom may be (relatively) thriving!<br><br>It is likely not much of a consolation to most, that the death of globalism will mean the end of global identity and, eventually, an end to the sadness many of us feel. But I thought it worth pointing out. The forging of new identities (and with them new purposes, and eventually new civilizations) will wash away the sadness we feel over what might have been. Not many Iranians are weeping over Xerxes' missteps at Salamia and Plataea, after all. <br><br>I for one welcome our new tribal overlords, and place the blame for this Fourth Rome's failure squarely on the shoulders of those perfidious swindlers from Michigonia! And from it a new empire will be born to replace the old one, identical to America in every way except for language, ethnicity, structure, culture, and location. But still! To arms, for the Holy American Empire!<br><br><a href=#c5937407878150990003 title="comment permalink">2/5/15, 9:45 PM</a><br><br>

Kevin Carson already won this debate with Greer. The real debate is will society maintain cohesion long enough to develop the requisite systems. So it’s not a matter of if it’s possible – it is. It’s a matter of can we build it in time? This isn’t at its core a resource issue, as Tverberg claims, this is a structural issue based on the current powers deliberately suppressing the very things necessary to create the successor society. One piece of good news here – the tools of abundance are now multiplying faster than they can be expropriated.<br><br>I wish I had more time to discuss this with you here. This is why I choose instead to focus on one or two points at a time to see if they stand up to scrutiny. The continued talking point amongst doomers that phosphorus is running out in the next 50-100 years is simply not true. I haven’t determined if this meme is based on ignorance or politically motivated disinformation. It’s not even running out in 300 years. Next point, solar energy can and will have the capacity to power civilization far more complex than our own. This is so easily proven, that I’m shocked and amazed otherwise educated people like Tverberg are arguing otherwise. As an ex-physicist I’m perfectly aware of energy flux density. Although that’s important in terms of how much space a solar panel takes up based on its efficiency, it’s a non issue in terms of us having enough space to capturing enough to do the job. At 12-15% efficiencies a smallish section of the upper Sahara would be enough. New panels now have double those efficiencies, thus cutting the necessary area in half. Super cheap organic solar cells are coming, yet already solar is reaching fossil fuel parity. Batteries are closing in on oil’s energy density. I will happily debate both Tverberg and Greer publicly on solar having the capacity to power human civilization. What is more arguable is will be able to replace fossil fuels with solar electric equivalents in time? That’s a good question, and the jury is out.<br><br>Regeneration is not an energy intensive issue, it’s about the deliberate creation of super durable but fully reusable, regenerative, and/or compostable materials from the get go! Duh! For example, stronger C-N nanomaterials will obsolete most need for metals anyway, not to mention the deliberate creation of modular reusable tool sets designed not to break, therefor no replacement cost and new materials needed.<br><br>Where Tverberg may be correct is will we experience an economic domino like collapse before alternative financial instruments can take over? She says no, and I can’t say she’s right or wrong. Several years ago, I would have more easily agreed with her. Now, and despite Bitcoin’s flaws, we have at least one. Other efforts at decentralized financial instruments are making headway.<br><br>We need to start separating out more meaningfully the differences between the many types of growth, complexity, novelty, change, stability, etc. Having over simplified black and white conceptions of each, results in the conflation of one with the another, resulting in what looks like serious one sided framing from both Greer and Tverberg."<br><br>http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/gail-tverberg-vs-john-michael-greer/2015/02/03#comment-1082066<br><br>First paragraph in the comment missing because of the 4096 characters limit.<br><br><a href=#c2079227947445600089 title="comment permalink">2/5/15, 10:46 PM</a><br><br>

It's not a rational belief, but a mythology based on faith, and it has to be confronted on the level of story, not that of reason. <br><br>Speaking of stories, who is willing to confront this story? It’s hard to see how the people a country could ever make an effort to care about the long-term future when they have faith in an irrational story such as this:<br><br>By the year 2050, 41% of Americans believe that Jesus Christ definitely or probably will have returned to earth. Only a 46%-plurality of the public does not believe Christ will return. <br>http://www.pewresearch.org/daily-number/jesus-christs-return-to-earth/<br><br>This stunning fact (which was also a fact in the 1970’s) was the main reason why I was certain that the US was never going to take collective action to limit growth out of concern for future generations. Why worry about your grandchildren’s future when your sky god is going to drop down and fix everything in a few decades?<br><br>But what was really disappointing was that those countries not cursed with a large population of irrational rapturists and with good science education systems also failed to make the collective choice to limit growth.

Continuing and extending his ideas and work is a thoughtful form of remembrance and eulogy.<br><br>Is it my imagination or are there deeper messages to be found in your essay this week?<br><br>It has been crazy busy here this week, so I didn't even get the chance to reply until Friday evening (tonight) sitting out with the chickens as they scratch around the orchard. They're a bit grumpy with me as I threw some of the broody chickens out into the orchard to stretch their legs and have a good scratch around. Those broody chooks aren’t sitting on fertilised eggs so it does them no harm. I should raise some chickens from eggs one day in the future…<br><br>As I was in the city last evening, I dropped into the cinema to see the film "Wild" which recounts the story of Cheryl Strayed who was emotionally damaged and self-destructive after the untimely death of her mother (Cheryl was 26 at the time). <br><br>After a harsh journey in the land of the plenty in which she found no solace, she sought to emotionally heal herself by reconnecting with nature by undertaking the Pacific Coast Walk which is 1,000 miles in length - alone. A beautiful film and story and also a good insight into some of the many paths which people take as their emotional strengths are tested against the harsh realities of the world that we live in. I salute her strength. She even had a totem animal in the form of a fox which would appear from time to time. My totem animal would be a wombat – no question.<br><br>I don't read Dmitry Orlov usually, but I do remember reading his descriptions of the breakdown in the Russian character and people as the Soviet Union collapsed. There but for the grace of the Gods go we and thus shall our future play out...<br><br>You might find this to be a funny observation, but at one point the story passed through Ashland, Oregon and oh yeah, I hear you man! Just sayin...<br><br>Yes, it reminded me very much of the time I was in Nimbin and visited the hippy museum. Not only did the town disappoint me, but the hippy museum hadn't showed much gumption on the part of the locals for over 30 years or so. They looked the part, but scratch just below the surface and they loved their SUV lifestyles. Oh yeah did they what.<br><br>Now I'm on a roll. Years ago, I went to a hippy camp out "Confest" which was massive. You know I turned up wearing my normal gear and I got ribbed from one end of the camp site to the other. And boy, was I grumpy with that after a few hours. So what, if I failed to display tribe colours. Big deal, but not to them, I guess. I got the last laugh because the funny thing was that a day or so later, it rained heavily and then all that tie-dye, cheese cloth gear got dumped and they all started wearing jeans and t shirts etc again. Any fool can put on the clothes but few indeed have the gumption to take up an alternative lifestyle.

Catton. You may be interested to know how I came to know him, and I think I was blessed. <br> The first time I heard about William Catton and the word “overshoot”, circa 1996, when I began to roam Internet and bumped into the Jay Hanson’d Dio-off website. By that time, I was already well-educated in the energy and ecology link to grasp the meaning of the passage from Catton’s book posted on the site. In fact, at this time, I was reading the course in Energy and Ecology for the students in Kiev Polytechnic based on the works of Howard Odum (Emergy), Donella Meadows (The Limits of Growth), and Fritjof Capra (System theory, ecoliteracy). So I was “ripe” to pick up what Catton was saying. And it affected me considerably. From that moment on, I was trying to read more of him. <br>In the late 90-s, I moved to the deep ecology, and started translating key anti-nuclear and anti-industrial thinkers. Then I remembered Catton, and thought it would be wonderful to publish his seminal book in Russia. However, no-one in Ukraine/Russia was particularly anxious to publish serious thinkers as the publishers preferred either New-Age stuff or business manuals. At that time I joined the left biocentrism (leftbio) group initiated by late David Orton, and through him I found Dr. Douglas Tompkins, and the Deep Ecology Foundation that helped me with the funding of the translations project. That was sheer luck. In 2006, I received a grant for translation and publication of two books - William Catton’s “Overshoot” and Jerry Mander’s “In the Absence of the Sacred”. Thus I had a great privilege to appreciate the depth and radicalism of William Catton’s thought. I will never forget the communication that we had with him at that time. Probably the happiest and most fruitful period of my translation work. I treasure his letters and the books he presented. <br> He also sent me his latest book, “The Bottleneck: Humanity Impending Collapse”, where he predicted the collase from yet another viewpoint, and that is the unbridgeable division of humans casued by specialization and general complexity of life. Its dehumanizing effect is now seen everywhere. <br>I’ve tried to popularize his ideas as best as I could, and I will always remain his grateful disciple. <br><br> - VP<br><br><a href=#c4677567201763672582 title="comment permalink">2/6/15, 6:16 AM</a><br><br>

The nuclear fantasy barely even registers. So it's impossible to deny that we are still completely dependent on ecology.<br><br>I think so many people reject these truths because they reveal that a lot of our progress, what people like to believe to be a result of human ingenuity, greatness, and free will, is actually just a result of a cold hard law of nature, kind of like a machine. This doesn't really jive with contemporary and religious views of what makes humans human. It also deflates everything economists have told themselves for the last several centuries, pretty much invalidating their entire discipline of study. It also doesn't bode well for politicians who would like any growth we attain to be sold as a result of whatever policy they're flogging to get re-elected, and who want to encourage people to get to work even harder to further build our societies into greatness.<br><br>Furthermore, almost all of the advancements in technology over the last half century have had to do with information management, not with hard things like energy and resources. But you can't live off information. Most of the advancements in the thermodynamics realm were made along ago, and any of the more recent ones (eg Green Revolution) are fully dependent on fossil fuels.<br><br>Having said that, I don't think solar energy is as diffuse as you are making it out to be. It is tremendously concentrated, and a patch of solar panels 400 km square would provide enough energy to power the entire world. But the problem is that they provide only intermittent electricity, which limits their usefulness. Electricity prices have been dropping almost continuously for at least a hundred years, something the Peak Oil blogosphere rarely if ever mentions. A hundred years ago, a kWh cost around 8 cents, the same as today, not even accounting for inflation! That's what solar power has always been up against, and explains a lot about why it is so hard to gain traction. Furthermore, it has an EROEI challenge (it's still positive though), since it has to also compete with coal which isn't terribly expensive and has a pretty high EROEI in comparison.<br><br>If someone could figure out a reaction for artificial photosynthesis then the game could be changed since it would allow solar energy to provide complex hydrocarbons (which is what we are currently running short of) independently of biological ecosystems. This wouldn't change our ultimate destiny, however, since we'd still be in overshoot with regards to so many other services that ecosystems provide. In fact, it would probably just permit us to grow a little bit further and make the ultimate crash even worse. But with coal so cheap I don't see much of an incentive for artificial photosynthesis developing.<br><br><a href=#c2614337678869608338 title="comment permalink">2/6/15, 6:39 AM</a><br><br>

I do remember the impact it had on me. I had read perhaps two chapters when I put down the book, stared off into the distance, and for the first time in my life thought those fateful words: "We're fucked, aren't we?" <br><br>Of course I didn't fully believe that epiphany on the spot - I still had a lot of work to do. I was the product of a progressive, liberal, scientific home; I was a hard-core software engineer during the peak of the tech boom; I personified the power of human ingenuity; I especially believed in exploring the truth or falsehood of any proposition on my own. <br><br>I began to look at the world around me more critically. Did what I see fit better with the cornucopian views I had held for the previous 50 years, or with this brand new, utterly heretical idea I had just encountered? The more I looked, the clearer the answer became. The human species is undeniably in the state of overshoot that Catton described so unsparingly. <br><br>Accepting that premise, however, brought me face to face with an extremely uncomfortable set of conclusions. Situations that are unsustainable will not be sustained. Overshoot implies correction. Correction implies dieoff. Dieoff implies a radical alteration of our species' accustomed way of living. <br><br>I began looking for signs that the human ingenuity I worshiped so fervently would be able to turn the situation around before Mother Nature, red in tooth and claw, stepped in to do the job for us. This time, the more I looked the less evidence I saw. When COP15 blew its brains out in Copenhagen at the end of 2009, I finally accepted that despite the best intentions of a few, the human collective has no intention whatever of trying to rectify the situation. We seem utterly committed to a one-way trip off the cliff, with the movie "Thelma and Louise" as our roadmap. <br><br>With that acceptance came a burning desire to understand why we are doing this. Why does our course seem irreversible? What is locking us into such an obviously catastrophic course of action? <br><br>My efforts to unravel these questions have led me a long way from the cornucopian tranquility of my software engineering days. The investigation has taken me down rabbit-holes I could never have predicted, where I found such gems as the materialist anthropology of Marvin Harris, Howard Odum's Maximum Power Principle, evolutionary psychology, complex systems, cybernetics and finally the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of Ilya Prigogine and Eric Schneider. <br><br>Bill Catton's seminal concept has been at the core of my writing for many years now. It helped to disabuse me of the notion that humanity could ever be a truly sustainable presence on the planet. It has allowed me to frame the radical understanding that even a few tens of millions of humans, living as we now do, are far too great a load for Mother Earth to bear. It has helped me come to terms with the possibility that our species could go extinct far more rapidly than most of us can comprehend. <br><br>Fortunately, in this life every coin has two sides. In the end, Catton's terrifying idea was responsible for triggering the spiritual explorations that have taken me through the "gateless gate" into a quieter and more joyful landscape. There aren't enough words in the English language to express my gratitude for this unexpected result. <br><br>So Bill, wherever, whenever and whatever you now are, thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you for your clarity, your courage, your wisdom, and for the humanity that flowed from you so naturally. You were touched by the glow of Diogenes' lamp, and became a beacon in your own right. <br><br>Rest in peace.<br><br><a href=#c3548070676381048925 title="comment permalink">2/6/15, 8:16 AM</a><br><br>

The new ideas of ecology, limits to growth, and the need for energy conservation were in the air, being discussed even in public schools. I grew up learning about some of those ideas. Back in high school, I and a few others in chemistry class co-wrote a report covering the atmospheric damage being done by chlorofluorocarbons, the health issues of vinyl chloride, and global warming.<br><br>In my junior year of college (1978) I interviewed for and was offered a summer job at Rodale's research lab, not far from the college. I'd accepted it when I also received an acceptance for a summer job at Bell Labs. Here's the relevance to this post: as concerned as I was about the environment, I'd chosen a major in chemistry instead of environmental studies, and I turned down the Rodale job in favor of the Bell Labs job. Call it my personal contribution to the tragedy you described. I consciously chose to better my career prospects at the expense of contributing to the efforts underway at Rodale to address environmental issues. While I did come to my senses in the early 1990s and started living a life of LESS, I missed the chance to add my efforts to the developing understanding, and I missed the chance to learn from all the interesting things going on at Rodale at the time (most of which I didn't find out about till the 1990s). It seems to me quite right to call this a tragedy. My personal and our collective greed led us to make a conscious choice to put ourselves first. Enough of us knew better that we could have changed course, me among them. It might help people of the future to preserve and tell that story, in case something like that choice faces them at some point. They might do better than us if they know our story.<br><br><a href=#c1606071965401072727 title="comment permalink">2/6/15, 8:37 AM</a><br><br>

Thus I decided that Marxism provides a very effective rebuttal to any possibility of a nuclear war. My fears receded.

And, on that soothing note, I went to bed, sure that no world war would break out.<br><br>Now, almost half-a-century later, as I was writing about the war, I realized how Marxism in that case really fulfilled the essential functions of a religion.

Even over the short distances that electricity moves from the solar panels to the controllers and batteries - there are significant losses of energy. And I do everything I can to reduce those losses.

Also, the arctic ecosystem just hasn't been consistently present on the geological time scale.

It, to me, sums up the attitude you often describe here, where people just cannot believe that people in the past were capable of using their brains as effectively as we do. When it really so often is quite the opposite it would seem.<br><br> "In the old days, some European immigrant farmers would actually taste the soil of their new American holdings to determine the pH, though it’s not likely they realized what they were testing for. Acidic soils (that is, those with a pH of less than 7) tend to be tart, while alkaline soils are somewhat sweet. While we wouldn’t recommend putting dirt in your mouth (who knows where it’s been!), the flavor apparently really can indicate which crops will grow best in your soil."<br><br>They talk about them as if they were colonists talk about the local indigenous people, "They make a serious of grunts, but it could hardly be deemed a language."<br><br>How hard is it to believe that knowledge they claim to only have just discovered through science, could have been known by those immigrant farmers doing the exact same thing? Surely they can't have understood the content of the thing on which their lives depended. Surely, farmers who most likely inherited their skills from their forbears, surely they couldn't "Know." <br><br>Then to prove just why they aren't as clever as our hero immigrants, they suggest that you don't taste it. To ensure that you stay un-barbaric I guess. Please don't taste the soil, soil is bad, use chemicals made who-knows-where to test it, and please don't try this at home. Ask a scientist to supervise you. <br><br><br><br><a href=#c1340575527869172002 title="comment permalink">2/7/15, 1:27 AM</a><br><br>

Your quotation from the novel interests me a great deal.<br><br>A religious movement called Wicca apparently originated among a small group of English people in the 1940s. As Wicca has matured, its practitioners developed every kind of ritual that Lawrence mentions, with the possible exception of the star rituals. That makes sense since the "great events in the year of stars" are according to Lawrence the business of entire nations and peoples. The division of labor of who performs the various rituals falls out in Wicca similarly to what Lawrence prescribes.<br><br>The sources of Wicca seem to be primarily literary, with influence from Freemasonry and a seasoning of British folk practices. It became a living religion largely through the creative contributions of its adherents. This also tallies with Lawrence: "To these rituals we must return: or we must evolve them to suit our needs."<br><br>Another Laurentian tie-in is that Wicca, unusually for a <br>Western religion, contains overt eroticism in its mythology and erotic symbolism in its ritual practices. <br><br>Wicca has outlived its founders and currently boasts at least a million adherents in the English-speaking world, having grown in numbers and influence without benefit of charismatic leaders or moneyed interests. I don't expect Wicca to become a mass religion, though it might contribute elements to whichever new popular religions emerge. I do think Wicca qualifies as proof of concept for what D. H. Lawrence says the human race needs. <br><br>I totally agree with the last four sentences of the quotation, at least as they apply to human beings who live in industrialized nations.<br><br><a href=#c1393426454491253430 title="comment permalink">2/7/15, 2:24 AM</a><br><br>

Although everybody has a feeling of what energy is, wrote Çengel and Boles (2002), it is difficult to give a precise definition for it. According to Halliday et al. (2003), it is very difficult to give a simple definition of energy. If we cannot explain in a clear way what energy is, the concept of energy must be a problem in science teaching.<br><br>But there does seem to be at least a formal connection via entropy between information and energy.

Physics is often best understood via "thought experiments". Think of it this way: imagine a light bulb in the middle of empty space. The light goes in all directions and its intensity diminishes by the inverse square formula. Now put an opaque hollow ball around the bulb. No light comes out, it all gets absorbed by the black paint on the inside of the ball. Now cut open a smallish hole in the ball. Light comes out, but only in a certain direction (plus/minus some angle). That light knows nothing about the light headed in other directions that did not escape that ball. The escaping light still diminishes with distance just as if the ball was not there.<br><br>A directional antenna, or focused flashlight beam (or laser, etc) is more like such a ball with a mirror-finish inside, so that the light going in other directions bounces around at first but eventually exits via the hole, rather than being absorbed by the dark wall. That part of the light, once free of the ball, also diminishes with distance the same way thereafter.<br><br>Regarding the solar panels in the arctic, the effect of an oblique path through the atmosphere may or may not be large, depending on how "dirty" the air is. But even ignoring that effect, that solar panel casts a long shadow with the sun being low in the sky. In other words, you can only fit a few solar panels in a given horizontal area of ground. And the same holds for green leaves, nature's solar panels.<br><br>Which reminds me of one of the nonsensical (IMO) ideas that for some reason hold a sway over the imaginations of many concerned people these days: "vertical gardens", as if they are the solution to the lack of space for urban agriculture, or for growing plants inside glass-faced buildings. But, if the sun is high in the sky, the upper leaves in a vertical garden shade the lower ones, denying them the energy source. If the sun is low, a vertical wall of leaves may get plenty of sun - but only when the sun is shining from the right direction, and this wall of leaves too will cast a long shadow. All this is not to say that you shouldn't grow something vertically up a pre-existing wall at the edge of your garden, especially if it is at the North end of your Garden (in the Northern hemisphere).<br><br><a href=#c7946686997051181291 title="comment permalink">2/7/15, 1:52 PM</a><br><br>

Our Prime Minister awarded a knighthood to Prince Phillip of all people. I assume and guess that such actions are indicative of his current mental state? Yes, the results are in and they're not good.<br><br>As an interesting side note he is now facing a leadership challenge this week and we may have a new PM before the week is out. Ned Kelly the famous bushranger was reported to have said just before he was hanged (or is it hung? I guess it must be hanged because other people were doing that to him? Dunno) "Such is life".<br><br>I must say that whilst you have a very genial President over there, his ability to say one thing and do another over a long period of time is possibly a good strategy for his own personal mental health. It'd be a taxing job for sure. I've always guessed - and I could be wrong - that our recent most popular Prime Minister Kevin Rudd who actually made things happen had a bit of a mental spill as once he was deposed as PM he was hospitalised for a week or so... Just sayin...<br><br>As another interesting side note, my gut feel says that the current incumbents took so much money in the form of donations (or should I say bribes / favours is that politically correct?) that they are now in a grid lock and the policies that they are pursuing are deeply unpopular as witnessed in the recent state elections. Then – again I’m guessing – the PM went, well at least I can do this one act and awarded the knighthood – only to find that the country as a whole was repulsed by it. Even his staunch supporters in the media are questioning this one. It just looks odd.<br><br>Hi Kutamun,<br><br>Great quote from DH Lawrence.

The male character showed about as much sensitivity and care for the good lady as a rutting wombat in heat.

Obviously there are plenty of practical considerations that drop that considerably, and that certainly doesn't mean that you can extract enough energy from it to power a modern industrial civilization, but your invocation of thermodynamics was misplaced.

I'm simply reflecting on things from the perspective of my own place and time. <br><br>Oyvind, so? Of course the purveyors of crackpot optimism are going to reject what I have to say -- after all, look at all this vaporware they've imagined! The proof of the pudding, though, is in the eating, and despite all the constantly shifting claims about this or that or the other miracle technology that's sure to save us all, the decline and fall of industrial civilization is still following the familiar trajectory. <br><br>Gloucon, I see that as evidence that a very large number of Americans have deliberately chosen to blind themselves to the future their actions are creating. (Jesus explicitly said that the Second Coming would happen when nobody expects it -- the fact that so many people are expecting it thus shows that it's not going to happen during the period they've assigned to it.) Not a good sign. <br><br>Cherokee, I don't know that there are deeper messages this time -- more personal, maybe. As for Ashland, oh man. Do <i>not</i> get me started!<br><br>Ed, good! Keep reading; there's much more. <br><br>Kutamun, I've long thought that it was the ecological spirituality, more than the sex, that got that banned. <br><br>Vic, thank you for this! I'm delighted to hear that Kiev Polytechnic had a class like that -- such things have been all but banned in the US for decades. <br><br>Markbc, 400 kilometers on a side? Sure, and if pigs had wings we'd all catch our breakfast bacon with butterfly nets. It's that kind of wildly impractical fantasy that keeps people from noticing the reality of the limits we're under. I have a suggestion: talk to people who actually supply their own power, off the grid, via sunlight, and find out from them just now much work it takes to get a trickle of concentrated energy that way. <br><br>Eric, well, we'll have to wait and see. <br><br>Adrian, thank you for this. <br><br>Joe, well, that's about what I'd expect from Wikipropaganda.

Back in the 1960s and 1970s, there was a movement called "radical psychotherapy" that took the opposite stance, identified the existing order as basically stark staring nuts, and set out to teach people how to become sane despite it. I'm sure you can imagine just how long it took them to have their funding and access to peer reviewed journals cut off. <br><br>Steve, I don't think I've stated it quite that baldly, but yes, that's the basic strategy. <br><br>Paul, many thanks for this! <br><br>Mickey, Schopenhauer says early in <i>The World as Will and Representation</i> that his entire work is the explication of a single thought; the same thing is true of this blog. In both cases, it's not an easy thought to grasp, so exploring it from many different angles seems to be a good idea. <br><br>SLClaire, thank you for having the courage to tell your story.

I've known American Marxists for whom their ideology functioned as a religion; it's fascinating to hear that it functioned the same way on the other side of the Iron Curtain. <br><br>Moshe, I consider the Maximum Power Principle dubious as a description of nature and positively pernicious as a justification of human behavior.

As long as people remain utterly ignorant of, and resistant to learning about, the fundamental processes that keep us all alive, we're going to run face first into one preventable disaster after another. More, much more, on this further down the road.<br><br>Bruce, some of the most stunning examples of belligerent ecological ignorance I've ever seen have come from people who claim to be Pagan nature worshippers. I wish I could say that Druids in general had a clue about ecology, but that sort of knowledge isn't as widespread yet as I'd prefer. <br><br>Ozark, of course there are many factors, all of which limit polar biodiversity. My point was that the energy gradient imposes an absolute thermodynamic limit at the top, and everything else pushes it down from there. <br><br>LatheChuck, hmm! I don't have anything to mind, but a songbook along those lines would be worth compiling. <br><br>Zentao, Catton dealt purely with the material plane -- that was his focus, and also his professional and cultural bias. I don't think that lessens his achievement, though it does mean that there's plenty of work to be done integrating his insights into the broader view that spiritual traditions offer. One point I'd make, though, is that -- as I've noted here before -- the planes are discrete and not continuous; the laws of material nature are what they are, and the laws of other planes don't cancel them out in the realm of matter, however well they apply to other planes. <br><br>Bret, by all means read Prigogine. It's not an equivalence between complexity and water flow, but between energy gradient and water flow; complexity in a thermodynamically open system corresponds to the amount of kinetic energy that can be extracted from running water via a water wheel, turbine, etc. <br><br>Kyoto, those of us who were thinking in terms of the limits to growth around 2000 were very sparse on the ground, and a lot of us were working in complete isolation, surrounded by people who had no clue and would react violently if any attempt was made to give them one. Still, as Charles Fort pointed out, it steam-engines when it comes steam-engine time...<br><br>Dltrammel, thanks for the link!<br><br>Steve, well, I haven't been at it for 75 years yet, but that's a dance I'm very used to doing. <br><br>Crow Hill, I haven't talked about duty, because that's wasted breath for anyone who doesn't already recognize it. Ethics have been mired in the language of "thou shalt" for so long that I think a lot of people forget just how useless that is without a preexisting ethical consensus to give it teeth. <br><br>Dau, that's true, but you'd want to be careful these days, given the amount of toxic waste that's been dumped into the soil!

That's one of the reasons I talk about it, when most people of my generation won't -- it's crucial that the generations that didn't take part in the mistakes of that time understand what happened, and why. <br><br>Jonathan, thank you! It's not original to me, but I've long since forgotten where I found it. <br><br>Dale, which Paolo Rossi are we talking about? The historian of Renaissance thought, the football player, or who? <br><br>Roger, to some extent the problem is the dualism. Optimism and pessimism aren't the only two options; what about heroism, for example, the attitude that recognizes bad things coming and proposes to face them head on? No "cringing" there. As for guns, you have to remember that the US is not a civilized country. It's in exactly the same state as those regions on the fringe of the Roman world that adopted some of the habits and many of the vices of Roman civilization, while still practicing headhunting, tribal feuds, and the like. <br><br>John, one of the problems is that so many people who know something about entropy default to the information-theory interpretation of it. I'm talking about the old-fashioned physical version of it, the sort of thing you use to calculate the potential efficiency of a heat engine -- which is what the Earth-Sun system is, thermodynamically speaking. <br><br>Dennis, excellent. You're in the contest -- bonus points if you get contacted by a clueless investor. As for population, that's one of several reasons I don't discuss it; the more important of them is that human population is a dependent variable, and will decrease when and as energy per capita drops below subsistence level. <br><br>Cherokee, I don't know if I'd call our president "genial" -- "utterly detached from reality" would be a closer description as far as I can see. It interests me that over the last few decades, the people who have been willing to run for that job have been increasingly inexperienced and clueless -- as though those who've been around long enough to get a clue know better. <br><br>Cathy, yes, it's become embarrassingly overpriced. I hope that bubble pops sometime soon, so that ordinary people can afford letterpresses again. <br><br>Justin, you know, if I'd tried to come up with an example of the current blindness to whole systems, I don't think I could come up with a better one than the argument you've tried to make. Let's transpose the issue into simpler terms for the sake of clarity. We have a steam engine and a boiler, and a firebox of burning coal that heats the boiler. Okay? Now move the firebox 100 meters away from the boiler. Here's your question: once that has been done, does the amount of energy the steam engine can produce depend on the heat emitted directly by the burning coal in the firebox, or by the fraction of that heat that makes it across 100 meters of inverse-square diffusion and atmospheric filtering to heat the boiler? <br><br>If you have any questions, I encourage you to try the experiment with any kind of heat engine and any heat source you care to use. You can also do it with a light source and photoelectric cells, by the way. Under any set of conditions, the actual efficiency possible depends on the energy gradient between the energy that reaches the absorptive surface and the ambient background, <i>not</i> the gradient between the source and the ambient at the location of the heat engine. <br><br>What you're missing, of course, is that the sun and the solar collector are parts of a whole system that also includes 93 million miles of empty space and the whole thickness of the atmosphere, and the impact of the inverse-square law and the work done by the sunlight in heating the atmosphere has to be included if you want to avoid absurd conclusions.<br><br><a href=#c132936568581165273 title="comment permalink">2/7/15, 10:30 PM</a><br><br>

I'll buy that! Figuratively and literally. Actually, it fits into an idea that I've been mulling -- the need for a multi-level, multi-year curriculum on "navigating the decline". I see this beginning with children around 10-12, and on into adulthood ("lifelong learning"). Certainly a large piece of this curriculum would focus on the practical, coming from sources like Green Wizardry. However, learning to "see systems whole" and relate them to practical concerns would avoid a lot of trial and error, and provide a common "working language" for communities relearning self-sufficiency. Ideally, your primer could serve as the basis for expansion into a full sequence. (In terms of Rob Hopkins' triad, this combination would cover the Head and Hands; for the Heart, maybe something from Merlin's favorite well...)<br><br>Re: "... those who believe the myth -- and human beings, even (or especially) in industrial societies, do far more of their thinking with mythic narratives than contemporary culture is willing to admit .." Perhaps another primer/course, on the nature, use and misuse of myths and mythologies? (I've been reading several of Joseph Campbell's essays lately; it makes me wonder about the possible overlap between mythology and the occult. I'll bring that up on Galabes when I can.)<br><br>Re Fuller: John Michael, don't read Critical Path unless you're in a mellow mood, have a pleasant libation handy, and can surf the currents of Fullerese with aplomb. However, you'll also find some howlers that'll give you a good belly laugh.

The "efficiency" of a solar panel is the ratio of output electrical power to input light power. That does not depend on how far it is from the sun. The same solar panel that has, say, a 15% efficiency on Earth has the same 15% efficiency on Mercury or Neptune. The actual amount of power output will of course be very different. The "efficiency" determined by the laws of thermodynamics is that ratio of output to input, not the absolute power level. If you could construct a ball of solar panels that completely encloses the sun (ha!), you'd harvest 15% of the sun's output, regardless of the diameter of that ball.<br><br>Now that's the "efficiency" of the solar panel itself. The efficiency of the total physical-economic system that includes mining and transporting the materials, processing them into solar panels and the other related equipment, distributing the electrical power, etc, that's another story. And I agree that you won't do that much better overall than Nature's green plants, designed and perfected over a billion years. Except in the sense that, through the burning of long-accumulated fossil fuels for performing much of those processes, you can create the appearance of a bustling solar-energy conversion scene.

Wages for workers fell freely in the eighties, and unions were stuck with cannibalizing other unions to try and shore up their numbers.<br><br>Other effects, relating to this blog and the 80's discussion:<br><br>- Demand destruction. Workers earning 3/4 of their wages (if lucky, not counting lost benefits) can't buy new cars or do those vacations they used to, thereby putting a downward pressure on oil prices. Add to that Alaska and the North Sea and you have cheaper gas for those who made it through unscathed (relatively or absolutely).<br>- Raising up of Management as good, with all that that entails. When workers had some security one could easily diss the management as being unaware of the realities on the ground, once working for a living became unstable Management gained stature beyond what it earned - or deserved.<br>- Fixation on University as the way towards the American Dream. How else, after all, is one going to find a job that doesn't leave you open to firings at a whim? The cleansing of all non-degreed management from corporations in the nineties exacerbated this.<br>- I'm-All-Right-Jack-ism. If any and all forms of collective action are made impossible below a certain level of status, then the ability to "raise one's self by one's bootstraps" (remember THAT phrase?) becomes a necessary part of one's beliefs. Never mind the extreme emphasis on working with whomever you're placed with that was all the rage in University (this directly observed by yours truly in the late eighties), one's position came about by one's own efforts.

Nature as a system is working with a much larger energy gradient than you give credit for. The individual subsystems may be working with smaller gradients, but the whole is a different story. <br><br>On a smaller scale, yes the amount of work that can be done by a heat engine on earth is dependent on the temperature gradient between the hot and cold sources. That doesn't directly translate to solar energy in the way you think.<br><br>Work and most forms of energy don't directly affect entropy. That is the basic principle behind a reversible process. Thermodynamics really only comes into play with temperature gradients. While in reality all forms of energy eventually become heat, this doesn't really affect the broader point here.<br><br>With solar energy the energy concentration between the sunlight and surroundings only matters for a solar heat engine.<br><br>Sunlight may be somewhat diffuse, but concentrating energy isn't really that big of a deal. That is why heat pumps can have efficiencies of over 1000% (or 90% depending on what side of the equation you are basing it on). Methods of concentrating electrical energy can have even higher efficiencies since they aren't subject to direct thermodynamic Carnot cycle losses, but are instead only limited by less restrictive 2nd law, which really only says the efficiency can't be 100% since in the real world some heat is always generated. <br><br>In that sense, the total amount of energy incoming really is more important than the concentration. What determines usefulness to human civilization are EROI and economic concerns, which have only an indirect relationship to energy concentration. Conflating EROI and economics with thermodynamic feasibility is a mistake. <br><br>As I said earlier, I'm not trying to argue that solar energy can power a modern industrial economy, but it isn't thermodynamics that stands in the way, it is other practical considerations.<br><br><a href=#c2853245559772680958 title="comment permalink">2/8/15, 9:25 AM</a><br><br>

I was comforted by the idea that at least it was just a bunch of dumb kids who had chosen wrongly, at least the grown ups would surely get it right in the real election. Imagine my distress when this turned out not to be true.

I talk about the earliest stages of the journey in an essay on my web site:<br>http://www.paulchefurka.ca/Sprituality.html<br><br>Starting from that initial recognition of my pantheism, I incorporated Deep Ecology along with elements of a wide variety of traditions - animism, shamanism and Wicca; Sufism, Mahayana, Vajrayana and Zen Buddhism; Taoism and Advaita. <br><br>There have been a variety of awakening experiences along the way, including the effect of reading Catton's book that I described above, movie-like visions of human history, a classic Buddhist satori during a guided meditation on a blade of grass, an Advaita realization of no-self, up to my recent understanding of the role of non-equilibrium thermodynamics in shaping human behavior at the biological and cultural levels.<br><br>Along with that learning has been a lot of self-inquiry aimed at relieving my emotional reactivity. My desire has been to develop the ability to "step back" far enough to see what's really happening in the world without freaking out and taking it all personally.<br><br>It has been a decidedly personal, "salad-bar" approach, driven by my own motivation, interests and character. I have made only peripheral use of teachers, mostly in the early days because I didn't have a clue how to undertake such a journey - aside from reading Joseph Campbell, of course.<br><br>These days I work mainly from the principles of Taoism and Advaita, garnished with the Four Noble truths.

The mechanism of PV cells is quantum-mechanical, depending on the energy of the photon exciting an electron into conduction. The energy of the individual photon could be regarded as a product of the source temperature (the sun), but I don't see how a PV panel can be analyzed as a heat engine. <br><br>In a way, it's like comparing incandescent light bulbs with LEDs. In the incandescent bulb, light is essentially a by-product of the filament temperature (a black-body radiator), and halogen bulbs are more efficient just because they can run hotter (shifting more radiation into the visible range). But in an LED bulb, electrons jumping the quantum bandgap emit visible-light photons directly, and the heat is just a byproduct of the light-generating process (and losses in the power-conditioning electronics).<br><br>Photosynthesis uses just two energy bands (red and blue) of the visible spectrum, green being largely reflected away, and infrared (I suppose) helping with the transpiration that brings nutrients up out of the soil. Vertical urban farming might have a <i>chance</i> (though I'm still skeptical) if it's cheaper to bring energy in from the "wind/PV fields" to the LED panels than to bring in the produce, and to process the compost and humanure in the city instead of trucking it out to the farm.

I don’t think that it means it can’t be done; only that any technology that isn’t rooted in your own tech base has too many assumptions for a lone inventor to handle.<br><br>On top of that, what we desperately need is a drastic change of attitude on a species-wide bases. If the attitude doesn’t change, nothing we do technologically is going to have any significant effect. If it does, the unthinkable will at least become thinkable.

Fuller to me is what a different iconic figure of the same era called a worthy opponent; grappling with his ideas always makes me think harder. <br><br>Richard, I've discussed this repeatedly here. When people start going on about "runaway global warming," that's usually a good sign that they haven't taken the time to look up what happened the last dozen or so times the Earth's climate was destabilized by massive greenhouse gas releases, and so they don't realize that this simply means a shift from our current climate equilibrium to a warmer one -- closer to the jungle-planet climate Earth has had for most of its history. If you go back to last year's posts on Dark Age America, you'll find the likely effects traced out in some detail.<br><br>Scotlyn, it's still in print, and <a href=http://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/63fae3tq9780252008184.html rel=nofollow>available from the publisher</a> for US$28.00. <br><br>Karim, interesting. I haven't had time to read England's paper; the reports in the science media were that his theory makes the emergence of life a very likely event anywhere conditions permit. <br><br>Dau, the thing is, your point was a good one, even though the specific illustration was problematic for certain reasons of detail. <br><br>Moshe, "efficiency" probably wasn't the best word, as Justin (below) proceeded to fixate on the efficiency with which individual photons get turned into electricity: a small portion of the whole process that connects sunlight with useful work. It's the efficiency of that whole system which declines as the energy gradient becomes shallower, as I understand -- and that's before factoring in manufacturing and maintenance costs. <br><br>Donald, a useful summary. <br><br>Justin, conflating the Earth's energy budget as a whole with the practical possibilities of tapping into energy flows to power an industrial economy is a neat rhetorical trick; switching the focus to the quantum-level efficiencies by which individual photons drive electrical current flow is another, and the combination of the two leads you to make claims that have already been shown to be mistaken by actual experience. To cite just one example, the more diffuse your solar energy input, the larger the area of solar panel needed, and so electrical resistance -- which is proportional among other things to the length of a conductor -- eats a larger share of your intake. There are dozens of other diseconomies of scale that come into play when you're working with diffuse energy, which is why nobody I've ever met who actually depends on an off-grid solar power system agrees with this notion that we can maintain anything like our current lifestyles on solar power -- and also why large-scale solar PV installations only make money if they're propped up by government subsidies. The proof of the pudding is in the eating; if solar PV were as great as its proponents claim, why doesn't it work that way in the real world? <br><br>Ed-M, hmm! I missed that one. I don't always catch everything. "Jeez," by the way, isn't a profanity in my book.<br><br>Justin, here again, you're fixating on the microscale, the efficiency with which individual photons drive eletric current. I'm talking, again, about whole systems. If you have a light bulb that emits 1000 watts of radiant energy, how much of that energy can you pick up with a 1 square inch PV cell and use to do work? The distance between the source and the PV cell does indeed affect that, according to the inverse square law. When you ignore that, you ignore one of the main factors shaping the performance of the whole system.<br><br><a href=#c1572289843648436841 title="comment permalink">2/9/15, 12:02 AM</a><br><br>

Yes, Einigan's rowan staves are relevant in this context. <br><br>LatheChuck, the point in using Carnot efficiency is that it tends to work on the macroscale no matter what the underlying mechanism is; photosynthesis is a quantum process ultimately, for example, but when I was taking ecology classes, certainly, analyzing an ecosystem as a heat engine produced useful models and useful results. In the same way, the PV effect is simply a way of converting energy flow from one form to another, and it can be -- at least in current theory -- a highly efficient one, but that still represents only one energy conversion in a whole system, and that system can be modeled conceptually in terms of general thermodynamics with good results. <br><br>Cherokee, fascinating.

I knew, John, that you would respond in a contrary fashion, so kept a low profile until you gave your polite broadside. Alas I find myself agreeing with you as well. How can I resolve this? Here's an attempt:<br><br>If we look at the Club of Rome report way back when, if I'm not fundamentally misunderstanding it, I think its main conclusion is that no matter how one tweaks things, the basic pattern of events implied by the various computer models/runs is essentially the same. If I may paraphrase Monty Python, these models suggested that the brontosaurus we call industrial civilization would be big in the middle and small at both ends.<br><br>I imagine Mr. Catton would also agree that, on a large scale, there is a certain inevitability to how things would turn out no matter what we did. As soon as one bases one's civilization on drawdown, overshoot and crash are certain. <br><br>On the other hand, zoom in to the scale on which any of us actually live our lives and the differences in the various scenarios of the Club of Rome, or any others, would have been / are very important to us living now. As a specific example, though Hubbert’s curve is also much like a brontosaurus (for exactly the same reasons), it is by no means fixed in shape any more than the Club of Rome's curves were. The only thing that is reasonably fixed for Hubbert's curve is the area under that curve i.e. the Ultimate Recoverable amount of oil. The issue was always making the backside of the curve less steep and so the crash less catastrophic.<br><br>So, on the scale that really matters to people alive today, yes, we could have made much better decisions. Then again, given the realities of our culture, I think doing so was about as likely as the Greenland Norse making a smooth transition to a way of life more like the Greenland Inuit that survived them: theoretically possible, but culturally almost impossible. Solar panels on the White House were an encouraging sign though. Maybe one of those Greenland Norse actually tried out a kayak with harpoon, who knows. Anyways, in both cases it didn't last for whatever reason.<br><br>Given we are so late in the game, I think we can agree that what matters most right now is what each of us has already done and/or in the process of doing.<br><br><a href=#c6022648172978422218 title="comment permalink">2/9/15, 8:12 AM</a><br><br>

I was in the middle of reading Overshoot when I attended ASPO conference 2011, and I too had the opportunity to meet him. I happened to be sitting next to him during lunch and talked to him for a half an hour. He had a humble, soft-spoken, friendly demeanor and I feel grateful for the interaction I did have with him. I remember when I mentioned that I was reading his book, he seemed worried. "Oh no, I hope I'm not depressing you," he said, perhaps concerned that I as a young person he was shattering my optimism. I told him not to worry -- I already had a worldview that could handle it. He signed my copy of his book, and in it he also wrote "I hope that we "pessimists" are wrong, but we most probably aren't." He clearly was not in favor of what his worldview meant for the next century, but it's not a matter of "liking" or "not liking" it that determines the outcome.<br><br>One of his ideas of which I am constantly reminded is his dislike of the word "production" when talking about oil production. He preferred using the term "extraction" which more truthfully conveyed what was going on -- we do not "produce" oil, only extract it.<br><br>It would be great a publisher to re-publish his book--I think there could be enough of a market for it. There are only so many used copies one can buy online. In the DC library system where I work, there is one copy available, but it has been checked out fairly often through the years.

Homeschooling curriculum for “Navigating the Decline”.<br><br>As I'm also schooling my children, I've given this issue some thought. In fact the issue weighs very heavily in the back of my mind almost all the time. <br><br>One problem, beyond giving my children a basic understanding of where we are as a civilization, is that I am not at all certain that I myself am navigating the decline appropriately. Further I'm not sure my mode of navigation will work for them even if what I am doing is appropriate for me. <br><br>This is not to mean I'm doing nothing. I'm well along the path of producing a fair amount of our own food in a relatively low tech way. Still, this path is highly subsidized by several sources of off “farm” income. I suspect it is not much more resilient (and perhaps very much less so) than most other ways of muddling through. And yet, I have nothing else to offer them. <br><br>After just writing the paragraph above my daughter came downstairs to inform me that she is “cold and hunger”. There you go. It may not be working that well. Well actually, yes, we do have some heat and some food. The illness of an elder relative means these are not well distributed between our two households as we lurch between the two to keep things going. She's now cooking an egg our hens laid this morning.<br><br>Another source of concern is the desire not to “steal their hope” for a happy future (in a dark time). My in-laws and my wife and I used to talk a great deal about the ecological state of the world. My father-in-law gradually backed away from such discussions as he began to perceive its negative effects on the mental health of his partner. Seeing these negative effects, he also began to become concerned about such talk on the young minds of my children. He felt it was wrong to blunt the hope and optimism of the young. Part of the beauty of youth is this almost completely unfounded optimism. Oddly enough, this optimism can be very helpful at that stage in life. How else could the young dare to tackle life? <br><br>Nonetheless, truth is better than illusion for making realistic choices. What exactly those choices should be, is not certain to me though. I'm still just guessing myself. Its hard to form a curriculum on guesses. Maybe our life now is the curriculum and that is as good as it gets.<br><br><a href=#c1272037679726380409 title="comment permalink">2/9/15, 11:37 AM</a><br><br>

The book goes on to discuss how a town or city not only had to have a certain minimum population to achieve a given degree of occupational complexity, but that there had to be enough smaller towns in its hinterland as well.

Those evergreen forests extend a bit further south too. <br><br>But if you were to move much further south again beyond those evergreen forest limits, then clearly nature cannot support an evergreen forest in that location and therefore the general conclusion has to be drawn from that particular observation that:<br><br>- electricity from solar panels at the latitude here can reliably provide an average of one hour per day during the depths of winter. If conditions were optimal it would probably be one and half hours.<br><br>- Move further south than here and that time becomes less and less until it doesn't provide much more energy than a very loud mouse fart.<br><br>I just can't understand why people don't get that if they live in an area that has evolved deciduous trees as a winter survival strategy, then relying solely on solar PV over winter is a waste of time.

Wrigley's book Poverty, Progress, and Population<br><br>Modern research by Geoffrey West at the Santa Fe Institute on allometric scaling laws with city size is the best source that I know about. From Wikipedia "his work states that with the doubling of a city's size, services per capita will generally increase by 15%."<br><br> Basically cites scale in a similar way to plants and animals; skin area grows as the square of height (or size) but mass grows as the cube of height and circulatory systems scale as the 2/3 power (from memory, it could be 3/4) and roads scale at the 2/3 (also from memory) power for population in cities. Similar relationships exist for service per capita, power consumption per capita, and crime per capita amoung other things.<br><br> As an interesting aside, the size vs number for cities follows a power law distribution where a plot of the log of the population per city vs the log of number of cities gives a linear relation. There are a small number of giant cities and a huge number of tiny cities. If this relationship holds during decent then the question becomes how big are the biggest cities going to be at the bottom of the decent.<br><br>Mapping Wrigley's work onto West's, or vice versa, should give you the occupations to size relationship and the history of failing civilizations should give you the maximum city size at the bottom of the arc.<br><br>And I would like to ask that if you delve into this that you please post the results.

Sub-linear scaling (with exponents less than 1) that comes from economies of scale, as in electrical or water distribution networks or road systems. These represent the city's shared infrastructure.<br> <br>2. Linear scaling (with exponents approximately equal to 1) that comes from individual or household consumption, such as domestic water and electricity, and food requirements. <br><br>3. Super-linear scaling (with exponents greater than 1) that comes from human creative activities.<br><br>I've used global population as a representation of a single world-sized city growing over time. This model allowed me to determine that CO2 emissions since 1900 have scaled super-linearly with an average exponent of about 1.65.<br><br>Given that the highest exponent West published was 1.27 for new patents, It's no wonder that CO2 emissions are proving so difficult to contain.<br><br>Incidentally, I found that the period from 1900 to 2013 broke down roughly into 4 distinct periods, each with a different scaling factor and associated constant multiplier. The periods were 1900-1949, 1950-1980, 1981-2000 and 2001-2013. The highest scaling factor was 2.1 for the period 1950-1980, and the lowest was 1.1 for 1981-2000. In 2001 the "China effect" kicked in and the scaling factor roared back to 1.9.<br><br>This behaviour is of course related to economic activity, which is also the result of human creative activity, with CO2 as the waste product.<br><br><a href=#c1088569206909473054 title="comment permalink">2/11/15, 12:19 PM</a><br><br>
