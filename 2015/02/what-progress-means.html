Last week’s post here on <i>The Archdruid Report </i>appears to have hit a nerve. That didn’t come as any sort of a surprise, admittedly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s one thing to point out that going back to the simpler and less energy-intensive technologies of earlier eras could help extract us from the corner into which industrial society has been busily painting itself in recent decades; it’s quite another to point out that doing this can also be great fun, more so than anything that comes out of today’s fashionable technologies, and in a good many cases the results include an objectively better quality of life as well</div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s not one of the canned speeches that opponents of progress are supposed to make. According to the folk mythology of modern industrial culture, since progress always makes things better, the foes of whatever gets labeled as progress are supposed to put on hair shirts and insist that everyone has to suffer virtuously from a lack of progress, for some reason based on sentimental superstition. The Pygmalion effect being what it is, it’s not hard to find opponents of progress who say what they’re expected to say, and thus fulfill their assigned role in contemporary culture, which is to stand there in their hair shirts bravely protesting until the steamroller of progress rolls right over them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The grip of that particular bit of folk mythology on the collective imagination of our time is tight enough that when somebody brings up some other reason to oppose “progress”—we’ll get into the ambiguities behind that familiar label in a moment—a great many people quite literally can’t absorb what’s actually being said, and respond instead to the canned speeches they expect to hear. Thus I had several people attempt to dispute the comments on last week’s post, castigating my readers with varying degrees of wrath and profanity for thinking that they had to sacrifice the delights of today’s technology and go creeping mournfully back to the unsatisfying lifestyles of an earlier day. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That was all the more ironic in that none of the readers who were commenting on the post were saying anything of the kind. Most of them were enthusiastically talking about how much more durable, practical, repairable, enjoyable, affordable, and user-friendly older technologies are compared to the disposable plastic trash that fills the stores these days. They were discussing how much more fun it is to embrace the delights of outdated technologies than it would be to go creeping mournfully back—or forward, if you prefer—to the unsatisfying lifestyles of the present time. That heresy is far more than the alleged openmindness and intellectual diversity of our age is willing to tolerate, so it’s not surprising that some people tried to pretend that nothing of the sort had been said at all. What was surprising to me, and pleasantly so, was the number of readers who were ready to don the party clothes of some earlier time and join in the Butlerian carnival. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are subtleties to the project of deliberate technological regress that may not be obvious at first glance, though, and it seems sensible to discuss those here before we proceed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s important, to begin with, to remember that when talking heads these days babble about technology in the singular, as a uniform, monolithic thing that progresses according to some relentless internal logic of its own, they’re spouting balderdash.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the real world, there’s no such monolith; instead, there are technologies in the plural, a great many of them, clustered more or less loosely in technological suites which may or may not have any direct relation to one another. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
An example might be useful here. Consider the technologies necessary to build a steel-framed bicycle. The metal parts require the particular suite of technologies we use to smelt ores, combine the resulting metals into useful alloys, and machine and weld those into shapes that fit together to make a bicycle. The tires, inner tubes, brake pads, seat cushion, handlebar grips, and paint require a different suite of technologies drawing on various branches of applied organic chemistry, and a few other suites also have a place:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>for example, the one that’s needed to make and apply lubricants<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The suites that make a bicycle have other uses; if you can build a bicycle, as Orville and Wilbur Wright demonstrated, you can also build an aircraft, and a variety of other interesting machines as well; that said, there are other technologies—say, the ones needed to manufacture medicines, or precision optics, or electronics—that require very different technological suites. You can have everything you need to build a bicycle and still be unable to make a telescope or a radio receiver, and vice versa. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Strictly speaking, therefore, nothing requires the project of deliberate technological regress to move in lockstep to the technologies of a specific past date and stay there. It would be wholly possible to dump certain items of modern technology while keeping others. It would be just as possible to replace one modern technological suite with an older equivalent from one decade, another with an equivalent from a different decade and so on. Imagine, for example, a future America in which solar water heaters (worked out by 1920) and passive solar architecture (mostly developed in the 1960s and 1970s) were standard household features, canal boats (dating from before 1800) and tall ships (ditto) were the primary means of bulk transport, shortwave radio (developed in the early 20th century) was the standard long-range communications medium, ultralight aircraft (largely developed in the 1980s) were still in use, and engineers crunched numbers using slide rules (perfected around 1880). </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s no reason why such a pastiche of technologies from different eras couldn’t work. We know this because what passes for modern technology is a pastiche of the same kind, in which (for example) cars whose basic design dates from the 1890s are gussied up with onboard computers invented a century later. Much of modern technology, in fact, is old technology with a new coat of paint and a few electronic gimmicks tacked on, and it’s old technology that originated in many different eras, too. Part of what differentiates modern technology from older equivalents, in other words, is mere fashion. Another part, though, moves into more explosive territory. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the conversation that followed last week’s post, one of my readers—tip of the archdruid’s hat to Cathy—recounted the story of the one and only class on advertising she took at college. The teacher invited a well-known advertising executive to come in and talk about the business, and one of the points he brought up was the marketing of disposable razors. The old-fashioned steel safety razor, the guy admitted cheerfully, was a much better product: it was more durable, less expensive, and gave a better shave than disposable razors. Unfortunately, it didn’t make the kind of profits for the razor industry that the latter wanted, and so the job of the advertising company was to convince shavers that they really wanted to spend more money on a worse product instead. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I know it may startle some people to hear a luxuriantly bearded archdruid talk about shaving, but I do have a certain amount of experience with the process—though admittedly it’s been a while. The executive was quite correct: an old-fashioned safety razor gives better shaves than a disposable. What’s more, an old-fashioned safety razor combined with a shaving brush, a cake of shaving soap, a mug and a bit of hot water from the teakettle produces a shaving experience that’s vastly better, in every sense, than what you’ll get from squirting cold chemical-laced foam out of a disposable can and then scraping your face with a disposable razor; the older method, furthermore, takes no more time, costs much less on a per-shave basis, and has a drastically smaller ecological footprint to boot. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Notice also the difference in the scale and complexity of the technological suites needed to maintain these two ways of shaving. To shave with a safety razor and shaving soap, you need the metallurgical suite that produces razors and razor blades, the very simple household-chemistry suite that produces soap, the ability to make pottery and brushes, and some way to heat water. To shave with a disposable razor and a can of squirt-on shaving foam, you need fossil fuels for plastic feedstocks, chemical plants to manufacture the plastic and the foam, the whole range of technologies needed to manufacture and fill the pressurized can, and so on—all so that you can count on getting an inferior shave at a higher price, and the razor industry can boost its quarterly profits. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s a small and arguably silly example of a vast and far from silly issue. These days, when you see the words “new and improved” on a product, rather more often than not, the only thing that’s been improved is the bottom line of the company that’s trying to sell it to you. When you hear equivalent claims about some technology that’s being marketed to society as a whole, rather than sold to you personally, the same rule applies at least as often. That’s one of the things that drove the enthusiastic conversations on this blog’s comment page last week, as readers came out of hiding to confess that they, too, had stopped using this or that piece of cutting-edge, up-to-date, hypermodern trash, and replaced it with some sturdy, elegant, user-friendly device from an earlier decade which works better and lacks the downsides of the newer item. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What, after all, defines a change as “progress”? There’s a wilderness of ambiguities hidden in that apparently simple word. The popular notion of progress presupposes that there’s an inherent dynamic to history, that things change, or tend to change, or at the very least ought to change, from worse to better over time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That presupposition then gets flipped around into the even more dubious claim that just because something’s new, it must be better than whatever it replaced. Move from there to specific examples, and all of a sudden it’s necessary to deal with competing claims—if there are two hot new technologies on the market, is option A more progressive than option B, or vice versa? The answer, of course, is that whichever of them manages to elbow the other aside will be retroactively awarded the coveted title of the next step in the march of progress. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That was exactly the process by which the appropriate tech of the 1970s was shoved aside and buried in the memory hole of our culture. In its heyday, appropriate tech was as cutting-edge and progressive as anything you care to name, a rapidly advancing field pushed forward by brilliant young engineers and innovative startups, and it saw itself (and presented itself to the world) as the wave of the future. In the wake of the Reagan-Thatcher counterrevolution of the 1980s, though, it was retroactively stripped of its erstwhile status as an icon of progress and consigned to the dustbin of the past. Technologies that had been lauded in the media as brilliantly innovative in 1978 were thus being condemned in the same media as Luddite throwbacks by 1988. If that abrupt act of redefinition reminds any of my readers of the way history got rewritten in George Orwell’s <i>1984</i>—“Oceania has never been allied with Eurasia” and the like—well, let’s just say the parallel was noticed at the time, too. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The same process on a much smaller scale can be traced with equal clarity in the replacement of the safety razor and shaving soap with the disposable razor and squirt-can shaving foam. In what sense is the latter, which wastes more resources and generates more trash in the process of giving users a worse shave at a higher price, more progressive than the former? Merely the fact that it’s been awarded that title by advertising and the media. If razor companies could make more money by reintroducing the Roman habit of scraping beard hairs off the face with a chunk of pumice, no doubt that would quickly be proclaimed as the last word in cutting-edge, up-to-date hypermodernity, too. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Behind the mythological image of the relentless and inevitable forward march of technology-in-the-singular in the grand cause of progress, in other words, lies a murky underworld of crass commercial motives and no-holds-barred struggles over which of the available technologies will get the funding and marketing that will define it as the next great step in progress. That’s as true of major technological programs as it is of shaving supplies. Some of my readers are old enough, as I am, to remember when supersonic airliners and undersea habitats were the next great steps in progress, until all of a sudden they weren’t.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We may not be all that far from the point at which space travel and nuclear power will go the way of Sealab and the Concorde. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In today’s industrial societies, we don’t talk about that. It’s practically taboo these days to mention the long, long list of waves of the future that abruptly stalled and rolled back out to sea without delivering on their promoters’ overblown promises. Remind people that the same rhetoric currently being used to prop up faith in space travel, nuclear power, or any of today’s other venerated icons of the religion of progress was lavished just as thickly on these earlier failures, and you can pretty much expect to have that comment shouted down as an irrelevancy if the other people in the conversation don’t simply turn their backs and pretend that they never heard you say anything at all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
They have to do something of the sort, because the alternative is to admit that what we call “progress” isn’t the impersonal, unstoppable force of nature that industrial culture’s ideology insists it must be. Pay attention to the grand technological projects that failed, compare them with those that are failing now, and it’s impossible to keep ignoring certain crucial if hugely unpopular points. To begin with technological progress is a function of collective choices—do we fund Sealab or the Apollo program? Supersonic transports or urban light rail? Energy conservation and appropriate tech or an endless series of wars in the Middle East? No impersonal force makes those decisions; individuals and institutions make them, and then use the rhetoric of impersonal progress to cloak the political and financial agendas that guide the decision-making process. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What’s more, even if the industrial world chooses to invest its resources in a project, the laws of physics and economics determine whether the project is going to work. The Concorde is the poster child here, a technological successbut an economic flop that never even managed to cover its operating costs. Like nuclear power, it was only viable given huge and continuing government subsidies, and since the strategic benefits Britain and France got from having Concordes in the air were nothing like so great as those they got from having an independent source of raw material for nuclear weapons, it’s not hard to see why the subsidies went where they did. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That is to say, when something is being lauded as the next great step forward in the glorious march of progress leading humanity to a better world, those who haven’t drunk themselves tipsy on folk mythology need to keep four things in mind. The first is that the next great step forward<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>in the glorious march of progres (etc.) might not actually work when it’s brought down out of the billowing clouds of overheated rhetoric into the cold hard world of everyday life. The second is that even if it works, the next great step forward (etc.) may be a white elephant in economic terms, and survive only so long as it gets propped up by subsidies. The third is that even if it does make economic sense, the next great step (etc.) may be an inferior product, and do a less effective job of meeting human needs than whatever it’s supposed to replace. The fourth is that when it comes right down to it, to label something as the next great (etc.) is just a sales pitch, an overblown and increasingly trite way of saying “Buy this product!” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those necessary critiques, in turn, are all implicit in the project of deliberate technological regress. Get past the thoughtstopping rhetoric that insists “you can’t turn back the clock”—to rephrase a comment of G.K. Chesterton’s, most people turn back the clock every fall, so that’s hardly a valid objection—and it becomes hard not to notice that “progress” is just a label for whatever choices happen to have been made by governments and corporations, with or without input from the rest of us. If we don’t like the choices that have been made for us in the name of progress, in turn, we can choose something else. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course it’s possible to stuff that sort of thinking back into the straitjacket of progress, and claim that progress is chugging along just fine, and all we have to do is get it back on the proper track, or what have you. This is a very common sort of argument, and one that’s been used over and over again by critics of this or that candidate for the next (etc.). The problem with that argument, as I see it, is that it may occasionally win battles but it pretty consistently loses the war; by failing to challenge the folk mythology of progress and the agendas that are enshrined by that mythology, it guarantees that no matter what technology or policy or program gets put into place, it’ll end up leading the same place as all the others before it, because it questions the means but forgets to question the goals.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the trap hardwired into the contemporary faith in progress. Once you buy into the notion that the specific choices made by industrial societies over the last three centuries or so are something more than the projects that happened to win out in the struggle for wealth and power, once you let yourself believe that there’s a teleology to it all—that there’s some objectively definable goal called “progress” that all these choices did a better or worse job of furthering—you’ve just made it much harder to ask where this thing called “progress” is going. The word “progress,” remember, means going further in the same direction, and it’s precisely questions about the direction that industrial society is going that most need to be asked.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d like to suggest, in fact, that going further in the direction we’ve been going isn’t a particularly bright idea just now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It isn’t even necessary to point to the more obviously self-destructive dimensions of business as usual. Look at any trend that affects your life right now, however global or local that trend may be, and extrapolate it out in a straight line indefinitely; that’s what going further in the same direction means. If that appeals to you, dear reader, then you’re certainly welcome to it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I have to say it doesn’t do much for me. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
It’s only from within the folk mythology of progress that we have no choice but to accept the endless prolongation of current trends. Right now, as individuals, we can choose to shrug and walk away from the latest hypermodern trash, and do something else instead. Later on, on the far side of the crisis of our time, it may be possible to take the same logic further, and make deliberate technological regress a recognized policy option for organizations, communities, and whole nations—but that will depend on whether individuals do the thing first, and demonstrate to everyone else that it’s a workable option. In next week’s post, we’ll talk more about where that strategy might lead.</div>

The technology, though clean, fairly simple and very energy efficient, was not quite as versatile as other forms of cooking -- basically, you couldn't use an induction range with an aluminum pan -- and so it never found favor.

It's about the meaning of life.<br><br>Take a very time-consuming technology you've brought up here, for instance: cutting weeds with a scythe. An objector would say to this, "You must have a lot of leisure time to be able to train yourself in using a scythe. Why aren't you at work?"<br><br>The deep underlying assumption is this: true "work" is not an activity that benefits you directly, but is something you do in order to get yourself some money, which can then be used to buy things you need/want. The end goal of your spent time is acquisition.<br><br>But the fellow buying the scythe needs to have a completely different view of things: time is not money, because time is <i>life itself</i>; and labor is not a means to acquire money but is itself a way for you to live. Training yourself in an outdated technology can be both work and pleasure.<br><br>("Time is life" is a quote on loan from Michael Ende, in his amazing book <i>Momo</i>)<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c4749346481902587044 title="comment permalink">2/18/15, 7:13 PM</a><br><br>

In one of my previous jobs, I worked for a company that was in a different business (a utility to be specific), in which the software was not a core part of the business. That company had some software that was written many years ago, and still working. From a functional stand point, it was not obsolete; from a commercial stand point, it was. This of course raises the philosophical issue of what is it that truly defines obsolescence. I have thought about it a great deal; including the areas I studied in engineering. We still use theories (both mathematical and scientific) that go back centuries, which are still valid. <br><br>Many software companies exist by having the institutions, that use the software, pay maintenance fees for upgrades, bug fixes, and the like. So the addition of features makes the software more generally usable, while simultaneously increasing its complexity. At some point, complexity increases to the point at which the software can no longer be fully tested. This situation is, of course, the old dilemma of diminishing returns. What has made the less efficient software possible to function has been the increased power of the hardware. But at some point, the limitations imposed by miniaturization in conjunction with quantum mechanics will be reached. This is in addition to the increased energy requirement to produce this hardware. Now x-ray technology is being used to produce smaller chips; a process that is more energy intensive that the earlier processes using lower energy wavelengths of the spectrum. <br><br>I have seen many "next big things" come and go, as I am now in my 50's. I recognize the fundamental limitations. Even back in college, we read about the appropriate technology movement as assigned work in some of my classes. My father was in the marketing field before he retired, so the observations that reader Cathy made about marketing are true. I suspect that as resources become scarcer, older values such as durability, reliability, and functionality will become more important, and that the throw away culture we have adopted will go by the wayside.<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c1027170780193239348 title="comment permalink">2/18/15, 7:49 PM</a><br><br>

It was the year 1975 at the ElCon Mall in Tucson, AZ at a library used book sale being held in the north end of the mall.<br><br>From the Dust Jacket:<br><br>“Consumption for consumption's sake... is rapidly being exalted into a virtue of its own right... through the capacity of America's productive system to produce more than we need, resulting in the increasingly frantic effort of industry, its promoters, marketers, and merchandisers, to persuade the buyer to waste more and more.”<br><br>I also have his other books, The <i>Hidden Persuaders</i>, <i>The Status Seekers</i> and <i>A Nation of Strangers</i>.<br><br>I don't think many modern day Ham operators appreciate just how much of their own equipment the early hams made.

It's presented as you build these things and you will communicate this far. This book is a fascinating read.

Telephones are really the more complex technology; they allow for a much higher quality of communication as well as real-time feedback rather than shot-for-shot messaging. Email and texting are really just a re-invention of the telegraph, with the bonus of sidebar advertisements.<br><br>Since I use a cellphone but mostly leave it at home, I think I can say that today I've reverted to 1980's communication technology.

That presupposition then gets flipped around into the even more dubious claim that just because something’s new, it must be better than whatever it replaced."<br><br>That observation doesn't just apply to technology. It also applies to biological evolution and cultural practices as well. When I observed Darwin Day last week, <a href=http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2015/02/evolution-humor-for-darwin-day.html rel=nofollow>I posted two cartoons showing how dinosaurs evolving into birds</a> may have been a winner in terms of surviving the end-Cretaceous mass extinction, but it was a loser in terms of being the dominant group of land animals, at least in terms of size and position in the food web. The result was that the genes benefited, but the individual suffered. Progress? Not if you started off as one of the raptor dinosaurs and ended up as a chicken.<br><br>Ambiguity over what constitutes progress <a href=http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2011/08/food-fight-thoughts-on-liberalism-and.html rel=nofollow>also applies to food practices</a>. The American political movement that seems to be most supportive of traditional ways to grow and prepare food consists mostly of people in what passes for the Left in the U.S., who style themselves as progressives, along with some libertarians, who are "the other kind of liberal," while people on the right oppose them and are championing industrial agriculture and processed food, the new ways of doing things. No wonder you call them pseudoconservatives. That phenomenon makes no sense if liberals are in favor of the new and conservatives are in favor of the old. It does make sense if liberals, or at least, the Left, which is not exactly the same thing, is in favor of what benefits the average person, while the pseudoconservatives of the American Right are in favor of protecting and supporting the already rich and powerful. At least some on what passes for the U.S. Left appear to recognize that the old ways are better for the average American.<br><br>On a different subject, one of your readers asked you about K-waves last week and you replied that you should read up on the topic in preparation for writing an entry about economic cycles in the future. I have a recommendation for you, the writings of <a href=http://www.safehaven.com/author/7/michael-a-alexander rel=nofollow>Michael Alexander</a>, in particular his 2002 book "<a href=http://www.amazon.com/The-Kondratiev-Cycle-generational-interpretation/dp/0595217117 rel=nofollow>The Kondratiev Cycle: A generational interpretation</a>." Not only does Mike write about K-waves, but all the other economic cycles running from the standard 4-year business cycle to up to the 40-year stock cycle. Full disclosure, I was his proofreader. On the one hand, I'm not completely objective about his book. On the other, I read the book in great detail several times, so I can vouch for the subjects my friend covered and its comprehensiveness.<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c572653483782361045 title="comment permalink">2/18/15, 8:03 PM</a><br><br>

Youth seems to love novelty, and accepts the new gadgets without looking at the downsides (the way we are all vulnerable to hackers is appalling! We don't have to be online - our medical, banking and tax records are!)but the older folk, who remember the simpler tools, are more pessimistic. And yet - it's such a struggle to back off without losing the ability to participate (The Seattle TV station KOMO has shut off the online comments section - you have to go to their Facebook and/or Twitter account to comment on their stories - and accept the privacy (!) terms of those services). But I'm still backing off, dropping one appliance after another as I see they are just expensive junk. (My house has only one thin rug and it can be swept with a broom, as can the wood floors).<br><br>One thing that stops many people is the maintenance issue. Sadly, most people I know would rather junk something or pay an exorbitant cost to an "expert" rather than be capable of fixing the various things they use. I have friends that would never touch a leaky sink, let alone replace a toilet gizmo. Heck, I've replaced a whole toilet - but most see the "ability" to let others do the work as a sign of personal "progress"... I see it as learned helplessness.

People have been trying to craft one for most of a century now, without success. No law of nature guarantees that such a theory will be found at all, much less in our time. Thus counting your technologies before they hatch may not be a useful habit just now...<br><br>Lili, thanks for all these bits of news! I call 'em regress, and am delighted by them. <br><br>Violet, glad to hear it. Over and above the other benefits -- such as not getting toxic drugs that were approved by the FDA even though they have horrific side effects, a detail that happens more often than not these days -- anything that puts you in charge of your own health, rather than surrendering it to some for-profit business, is a source of strength. <br><br>Avery, good. Thing is, people I know who use scythes tell me that it doesn't take any more time than using a powered weed-wacker, not if you keep your blade sharp and know what you're doing. <br><br>Repent, that's progress. Meaning that it's precisely that sort of mindless worship of whatever's new that is sending industrial civilization "progressing" right off a cliff. <br><br>Shane, for heaven's sake, why feel guilty? I'd suggest instead feeling aggrieved that you've been deprived of a real shave, with hot lather and a good razor, for all these years, and let that motivate you to get a safety razor, a cake of shaving soap, and the other tools you need to remedy that state of deprivation. Of course, you could also try growing a beard... ;-)<br><br>Druiddisciple, my experience suggests the same. At this point, with the collapse of quality getting as blatant as it is, it might just be possible to get that message across. <br><br>Jcummings, yes, that's a large part of what the last two posts have been about. The notion of deliberate technological regress is a tool -- a very useful one -- to help get outside the one-way street of progress for its own sake. <br><br>Michael, true enough. The new factors in the equation are, first, that the quality gap is becoming so blatant, and second, that the ability of the system to keep on loading new layers of complexity is beginning to show signs of serious strain. <br><br>Vultwulf, we're of the same generation, and I've seen the same thing. My guess is that the culture of disposability will come to a halt just as soon as getting replacements starts to become problematic...<br><br>August, Alfred Morgan! There's a name I revered in my misspent childhood. The public library system had volumes 1-6 of "The Boy's First (through Sixth) Book of Radio and Electronics," which were all about how to take oatmeal tubs, lengths of wire, random household scrap, and the very occasional piece of old electronics gear, and turn out radios and other electronics gear with them. If somebody were to reprint those on acid-free paper, I think there might be quite a market -- I'd be first to order a set!<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c2869159371085961080 title="comment permalink">2/18/15, 10:13 PM</a><br><br>

Thanks for the recommendation, and the cartoons!<br><br>Matthew, now if you can just communicate that to the rest of your generation...<br><br>Cathy, I'm coming to think that the sort of basic handyperson skills that allow you to fix a faucet or do other general household repairs may be a meal ticket, and possibly also the beginning of a lucrative career, in the very near future. If you can build a network of friends who know they can call you if something goes wrong, and you'll fix it for some sort of barter or what have you, you may be set. I trust others are listening...<br><br>Pyrrhus, I'd be interested in seeing some number crunching to show whether the increase in life expectancy is caused by the decrease in smoking, or simply correlates to that. Statistics are tricky things. <br><br>Cherokee, oh man. I've seen that in far too many places. An organization that focuses on trying to recruit new members, instead of making sure that new members have good reasons to join, is doomed. And yet so many organizations do exactly that, because it's easier than asking the hard questions about why people aren't eager to join or stay around once they've joined. <br><br>I'd encourage you to see if you can get something going with clear goals and clear benefits. Add a clear organizational structure that makes rights contingent on responsibilities, and make sure your organization can function if it doesn't get lots of new members in a hurry, and you may be able to accomplish something. <br><br>Gardener, sound advice. Thank you!<br><br>Myosotis, glad to hear it. If conversations like that get going more generally, there's a lot that can still be accomplished even this late in the day. <br><br>Ruben, maybe it was just youthful exuberance, but I didn't find a safety razor any harder to use than a disposable, and cuts are one of the hazards of any razor-based shave -- a block of alum in the medicine cabinet takes care of those instantly. Still, I hope you'll put up that post.

When I make coffee, I use a measuring cup to put the right amount of coffee into a filter paper, and the paper rests within a filter cone. I heat water in the kettle till it whistles, and pour the water into the filter cone. Within a minute or two, I have a big mug of strong, black coffee.<br><br>All of this is a far cry from the notion of single-serving packaged coffees, made with the aid of a device that costs several hundred dollars. Why on earth would I want to go the modern route? Why would I want to pay much more (capital and operating costs) for less coffee?<br><br>2. Vacuum cleaners .... somehow, I ended up with a "cyclone" vacuum cleaner that has to be disassembled in 4-5 steps to be emptied and cleaned after each use. And the manual says to wash (and let air-dry) the various filters and canisters in the vacuum. Whatever happened to the vacuums that used bags? I used to to empty the bag when the old one got full, replace the bag, and the vacuum was OK for weeks to come. No disassembly or parts washing needed.<br><br>Lee<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c364694026753958069 title="comment permalink">2/18/15, 11:34 PM</a><br><br>

One recalls the quote by Cheney that 'we will be making reality and you will be trying to analyze it and we will already be making the next reality, ad infinitum'. If we believe this quote as realistic internal view of TPTB, Bilderberger types and analyze history from inside the power clique not from fantasy patriotic history book we find it is realistic. Little guy sees fate as uncontrollable progress-which is the propaganda behind the sweep of history- and those up top trust in their fate-their star-to guide humanity-while decieving them for their own good. Whatever does not work out is ignored, rationalized away or claimed we planned it that way. Anyway attention spans are so short that today's news is irrelevant to relity tomorrow like with children. Reality is manufactured on the assembly line, history, past and present and future as well. Once TPTB have become convinced of your thesis it will be coopted. You will become minister in the govt. Progress will be redefined. GDP will give way to human wellness index. Will this change human nature? You want a power change, decentralization,, localization, deindustrialization,collapse leading to autonomy instead of alienation and slavery. Improvements like internet or printing press were revolutionary in their daysleading to mass informing of populace, creating revolutionary circumstances, now as then. They will contro intrnet as well. Freaks always wrote strange books. The mass media counts. Govt. Learns to control alt. media or discredit it(psychos, losers). <br><br>Whatever the result in the end if god forbid a JMG figure is Prez and the world is saved and brainwashed, convinced, of the proper way of seeing things then the underground dissenterswill chafe at the bit. It all goes in circles. After a while our cherished ideals will be bastardized beyond recognition. I recall the story of Sri Aurobindo. He was a prominent revolutionary but recognized that people never change and devoted himself to spirituality.<br><br>I imagine once our side has won as PO is inevitable we will decry this as progress, i.e. as preordained fate, by the gods no less. The word progress=fate, we just renamed as science is the new name for religion. Life gets lost in translation. We think we are different from our parents and one day we look in the mirror and see a long forgotten face. Einstein is Jesus. Spengler and Toynbee talk about synchronous points in historical cultures. Don't get too caught up in your own propaganda. <br><br>Anyway, end of being downer.

The razor assembly was hinged, and opened to hold the blade in both the cleaning and stropping modes. Each blade had a single sharp edge, but came with the other side protected by a thin sleeve of metal that helped in the assembly. When finally the blade could be stropped no more, it still made a useful fine-cutting tool; the protected edge directly held and pressed by fingers.<br> <br>Then he cycled to work as Chief Clerk at the bank, arriving home again after the bank had balanced the ledgers at the end of each day.<br><br>But we relied entirely on lots of coal for heat and hot water – and coal served also to make the town gas that mum used for cooking and made the electricity for the lights, radio and the ‘hoover’. And then there were the million miners, but in my childhood they could have been as far away as China. Our Thames Valley smogs nevertheless sometimes crept under the door having closed down all travel including walking; every bit as bad if not worse than Beijing is nowadays. And our half-tech (modern) local sewage system had already killed the chalk stream beloved of Victorian Nature writers and painters. The Great Wen of London stretched as far to the east as my imagination in those days could comprehend. <br><br>So the cutting-edge alternative technologies came in the 1960s like sun-up with hope and promise for the soul.

Sometimes we don't see all the consequences until we are suffering from them.<br>Consider electrification. It came to the mountain valley where I sit now about 100 years ago. I read in a book about the valley that in one farm house, the grandmother hid in a cabinet under the stairs, as the electrical light was switched on in the kitchen. She was certain it would bring doom upon the house.<br><br>You'd be hard pressed to find people who are against electrification these days - we should still consider the lengths we're willing to go to in order to secure electrical power, and we should also question the extent of its use.<br><br>The other day, I came across an interesting fact: electric lighting is killing an enormous amount of insects. Instead of resting at night, they are swirling around outdoor lamps until exhaustion. In the German city of Kiel alone, street lighting is killing many hundreds of millions of flying insects each season.<br>Why care? Because birds and other creatures rely on a supply of insects. Because the insects perform a number of necessary "first economy" tasks that we can't afford to perform ourselves.<br><br>Migrating birds are also at risk. Their paths cross areas where there are large oil platforms, and the flocks are attracted to the bright lights in the night. They begin circling the platforms until they drop into the sea from exhaustion. Platform operators have begun switching off the lights when a circling flock is detected, this sometimes sends them on their way again.<br><br>My point being: today, progress races along on many fronts, and tremendous changes happen almost as a matter of course, without any real forethought as to the consequences. JMG has mentioned slide rules a couple of times. I can remember getting my first electric calculator back in 1975 - little did I know that forty years later, the ability to do simple sums mentally would all but disappear, as people stopped calculating in their heads.<br>That's a minor consequence. But the electrification of information, and the delivery of same, has also had other pernicious effects for us. We have become sedentary, seated, immobile, in front of screens. Instead of traveling to information and community, we have information brought to us, and pretend to be parts of communities.<br>The consequences are huge.

All this talk of old tools etc has come at an interesting time - only last week I was helping a friend hang a new door, and whilst fitting the lock we were using tools that he had inherited from his grandfather, including a keyhole saw that was well over a hundred years old. When I get around to breakfast later, I'll be frying my eggs in a pan that must be a similar age - it was originally one of my grandmother's wedding presents. I'm over 50 myself and I'm sure it will see me out.<br><br>I think the first time I came across the idea that 'progress' (TM) wasn't an inexhorable and inevitable force of nature was in one of John Seymour's books back in the '80s, probably 'The Ultimate Heresy'. He explained quite cogently that if you're about to step off a precipice it isn't really 'progress' to keep going in the same direction, but in fact it's time to turn around and find a different path, even if it means retracing your steps. <br><br>One of the worst aspects of 'progress' is that prior technologies can fall into abeyance. One particular failure of 'progress' here in the UK has cheered me considerably, namely the roll-out of digital radio broadcasting. It just hasn't gained traction in the listening public, so there is talk of even abandoning the technology. This seems sensible to me, because I had visions of all the old AM and FM radios being discarded just in time for the collapse of industrial civilisation. In my post-crash visions of future tech, I could easily imagine the old VHF FM and SW AM receivers still being available and small-scale, local broadcasting could continue to some extent with home made transmitters. But if the listeners only had digital sets, well, the putative post-crash broadcasting sector would be strangled at birth. Anything that prevents the older AM/FM radios being dumped has to be a plus. TV here has now gone totally digital, but I don't really care for TV ;-)<br><br>On another front, I totally endorse Cathy's point about 'learned helplessness' when it comes to repairing things (which reminds me, I must get around to fixing the boiler, the shoddy plastic filling tap broke. Luckily, I had a eureka moment in the bath last night, and now know my junk box contains what I need to repair it better than it was before...) It has become so much the accepted norm that something 'better' will be available soon, so why not just ditch the old and 'upgrade' when it breaks down? Mind you, I am a bit ambiguous about this, as some of my income derives from fixing things that other people have learned to be helpless about.<br><br>These last three posts on ADR have been particularly pertinent, and I believe 'As night closes in' is the real 'money shot' for the whole project to date, to the point that if someone asked which one post to read, it would be the one I'd recommend.

As in the shaving example: I'm not trying to save the planet by reducing plastic use, it just seems more sensible and pleasant to use a straight razor. I have a relationship to the razor because I care for it and sharpen it. It's something to do rather than something to get done and out of the way. <br>Seems like so much of modern technology is based on getting things done and out of the way rather than to have a pleasant time and truly relate to the task or the tools used in the process.

But I learned the art of shaving from my grandfather and have been hooked on safety and straight razors ever since I started growing whiskers.

I remember too many lacerations from back in the day when that was the only option.<br><br>My non-disposable razor might as well be called disposable. It is a cheap plastic handle to which expensive, and very disposable 3-bladed cartridges are attached. Shaving roughly twice a week, giving the blades time to recover between uses, means that I can make a blade cartridge last for over a year.<br><br>Lately I have grown a beard. Not sure if it will last, but it at least means I will get even less use on the blades for trimming. When the time comes to replace, an old-fashioned safety razor might do the trick quite well.<br><br>But on that, I noticed that the "progression" in blades was not linear. I made the switch to double-blades probably in the 70s. It was a definite improvement over the single as far as the loss of blood was concerned. When the triple came out, I scoffed, but my son, who was just learning to shave at the time, went out and got one. I tried it and was sold. Just a much closer, comfortable and safer shave for me.

At this historical moment there seem to be two, often parallel issues when it comes to the value of alternate technologies. <br><br>The more obvious one is the technologies of getting things done - the value in the toolkit for accomplishing stuff. When people think alternatives it might be better in the here and now, like a safety razor - or better on the down-slope like vacuum tube radios - and so on.<br><br>The second one might be called the technologies of extrication. (You note that many of our technological suites will fall away whether we will it or not, but you are doing more here than trying to preserve fragile tech heritages.) <br><br>Much of the excitement among people actually weaving the awnings for your Butlerian carnival - has to do with using technologies or the mastering of technologies of extricating themselves from a highly unsatisfying (if still seductive and insistent) dominant culture with its out-of-our-control technologies and religion of progress. Same goes for the cognitive habits you develop here and the spiritual practices people bring to it. At this moment the value and appropriateness of "regression" are one part the tech of getting things done and one part the tech that helps us to extricate ourselves.

You can now buy good double edge blades online now! (I also bought a better razor than my old Gilette "Fat Boy" from 50+ years ago--my age is showing). If you ever take up shaving again, ahem, the Mitchell's Woolfat Soap from England is the best ever :|<br><br>I have reset my eating habits to those of a bygone era as well, having gone "paleo" or grain free, very careful about the types of fats I eat, etc. There is a lot of hard scientific evidence in support of this type of diet--from the biochemists and emerging medical literature. Think reverting 10,000 years in your diet!<br><br>I am still something of a futurist, in the sense that I think that in the fullness of time we will go into space in a significant way. But the Challenger disaster showed us that conventional rockets are probably not the way to do this on a big way. But, perhaps with the Theory of Everything, or whatever they call it then, we will find a way to "hum" from planet to planet without the roar of any dangerous rockets. The energy and materials economy of that era will be vastly different than most futurists can imagine today however. I think this view is wholly compatible with your ecotechnic visions of the future--and of course the existence of a future for us all depends on us not blowing ourselves into extinction in the turbulent times of the near future.<br><br>An aside on the life expectancy thing. The British 1850 census and modern censuses indicate that if you lived to 50 back then your descendants today would only have a couple of additional months life expectancy today at age 50. Mostly we did away with childhood illness (or almost, in the case of measles), and so on, so that more people make it to 50 today. Chlorinating water was the big step in that direction by the way--most of the kings of England, for instance, died of some form of diarrhea, which we can infer was from bad water. The third leading cause of death in the 19th century was pneumonia, and I have had my shots. It would not take a lot of residual technology to overcome the leading causes of death in the 19th century. Incidentally, childhood cancers did not occur back in 1850, not ever! They are a byproduct of modern pollution.<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c5422521037859041525 title="comment permalink">2/19/15, 6:34 AM</a><br><br>

I'm physically much fitter, I'm mentally calmer, I know how to do a lot more stuff and I need a lot less cash money to live. Which has all added up to more happiness.<br><br>At the same time, I'm aware that dialing my life all the way back to that of an over-worked 19th century farmer is probably going to make me miserable in a different way. So there's a balance to be sought and we're each going to have to do that in our own way, in our own location. Because I'm mostly simplifying my life right now, technology decisions are fairly easy: which ones can I stop using? <br><br>But thinking about how to use technology to save time and labor is a more difficult decision-making process. How to cut grass is a good example. Years ago I assume my ancestors grew food and plants on what would become a "front-lawn". Then at some point they were able to buy more food from the store, so they now had a "lawn" to worry about, which they may have scythed or borrowed a sheep to graze or something. Then maybe my grandfather bought a push reel mower and later upgraded to a very basic gasoline mower. Then my Dad upgraded to a hover mower, then a self-propelled push mower and finally to a mini tractor-mower. What was the "right" place to stop at? My current mindset says keep more garden space, use a push reel mower on the paths and let the rest grow to meadow. But I confess to a nagging feeling that if I was my overworked grandfather that power mower would have looked quite tempting. Although without the cheap energy sources, the temptation wouldn't have arisen.<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c8138836976096415690 title="comment permalink">2/19/15, 6:43 AM</a><br><br>

This particular post brings to mind the essay "Energy and Equity" by Ivan Illich. One though (of so many) that really stuck with me is the idea of the time cost of transportation. <br><br>There's quite a bit involved in his thoughts, but you can do the calculations in your own life to see how much this form of progress is actually costing you. To get your actual rate of travel, you need to add up the time invested in labor to acquire the money necessary to purchase a motor vehicle, it's maintenance, the legal requirements and funding the necessary supporting infrastructure. All of that goes on top of the actual time you spend in motion. When you divide that into the number of miles traveled, it turns out that often you're actually moving much, much slower than you could with the time budget involved in bicycling the same distance. Progress in speed comes with many, many other negative social impacts which are detailed in his essay, such as the exploitation of others. <br><br>As I grow older I'm finding more and more of our progress may not have yielded a true net improvement in life, at least not for the majority and not when considering some of the changes created in our society as a result. Often the negative outcomes are delayed, externalized, hidden, denied and/or simply ignored outright.<br><br>Back to lurking now.<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c1446006041979879742 title="comment permalink">2/19/15, 7:44 AM</a><br><br>

I simply grew tired of paying the exorbitant prices for the replacement cartridges. <br><br>I can draw parallels in the IT industry when a new piece of software comes out, especially a new operating system, always touted as better then the previous ones on the market, but inevitably it is not all that great due to bugs, incompatibilities with older software and an overall change to how the operating system is used. These things take about 6 months to a year before everything is ironed out into a solid piece of software. Heck Windows XP was out for a while before it was replaced, but is still being used in many places with China being chief among them. This all just goes to show how disruptive new technologies and the like can be, and not in a way that people normally react to change, and then eventually adjust, sometimes there is no complete adjustment, and it just get worse from there.<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c2653006152747084462 title="comment permalink">2/19/15, 8:00 AM</a><br><br>

What's interesting are the folks who prefer the "licensed experts" - not because they might do it better, but because they can be "held accountable", theoretically available to fix any complaints. But that is becoming more and more untrue - I think a turning point will be reached when most folks realize the "guarantees" aren't worth the pixels they're written with, and that a local source, a known friend or neighbor, is much more accountable - IF one learns the delicate skill of working out a problem with a real human being! That is one skill many people have lost, preferring to let an official referee "resolve the issue" - only that doesn't happen anymore.

Tried, true, and keep it as simple as possible; good enough but not crossing a complexity threshold requiring complex supply chains to operate and maintain. Avoid planned obsolescence. Some features:<br><br>Passive solar: Ancient technology requiring only glass, a stone floor (or other thermal mass), proper solar orientation, designed for seasonal variation, and thick curtains for cold weather. Not much to go wrong there, and the best investment I've made. It just works.<br><br>Lots of insulation, offset framing to prevent thermal bridging.<br><br>Passive cooling; again, very old technology: Operable windows, including windows high in the structure to naturally vent warm air; screens, and the common sense to open/close windows when needed. Windows oriented to make use of prevailing winds.<br><br>Gravity flow water; pumped from a spring to a tank buried on the hill above the house. Currently solar-pumped, but could be pumped using wind, a tramp, or other methods, even by hand. Water flows back to the house providing a constant 35 PSI. 2400 gallons storage, total; enough to supply days/weeks of water needs, if pump fails.<br><br>Ceiling fans (early 20th century?) I bought the basic, robust fans without the fancy circuitry and remotes. Operated by wall switches; reversible by flipping switch on fan motor.<br><br>Large (1600 liter) hot water storage tank, heated with solar and wood. Provides domestic hot water via a coil of copper pipe in the top. Also supplies hydronic radiant heat to floor - zoned; again, very old/simple technology. I remodelled a home built in the 1920s that had heat pipes in the plaster walls; still working, and the Romans had warm floors.<br><br>Wood heat to supplement solar; around as long as we've been playing with fire. I saved my parents' old soapstone unit, pre-EPA, and added a simple copper heat exchanger to the top of the fire box which circulates water to/from the big hot water tank using a small pump. Will also thermo-syphon if pump fails. Non-pressurised system! (Never put a closed-loop, pressurised system on a wood stove.) A welcome side effect is that the heat exchanger condenses unburned wood gasses which drip back into the fire to get burned. Keeps the emissions down and stove pipe very clean. This strategy, of course, requires a constant supply of wood, which we have on the property.<br><br>While we do use modern technology to control some of these functions (pump controllers, etc.) virtually all of these systems can operate manually, with a bit of human intervention (the horror!), and someone paying attention. I've intentionally avoided 'set-and-forget' systems that can get one in trouble or give one a false sense of security (see modern home security systems vs. having an alert dog).<br><br>Participating in the functions of the homestead is greatly rewarding; making things work, reaping the benefits; knowing that if I built it, I can maintain and repair it, and that I'm not utterly reliant upon complex, top-down systems and supply chains. Perhaps not as 'efficient', but not a lot to go wrong. In my world, good enough beats the heck out of diminishing returns, especially when ongoing financial inputs can be avoided. It's the financial thingy that's going to bite most folks in the rear.<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c6653220122422400609 title="comment permalink">2/19/15, 8:26 AM</a><br><br>

They are a key component to understanding why this culture is locked in the myth of progress and pointless consumerism. If there was a devil in human form, I think a good candidate would be Eddie Bernays who applied his Uncle Sigmund's understanding of manipulating the mass subconscious to making money and invented the ad industry. Goebbels later applied it to the furtherance of the Third Reich, and this is not a coincidental connection in my mind.<br><br>There are more examples of an unneeded product being hyped to the public than I can count. One example: Lysol. In the 20s Lysol ran a series of ad campaigns promoting a Lysol douche as a way to correct "feminine odor" that might cause her to be an old maid. Others promoted a Lysol douche as birth control. The razor business ran ads featuring a fetching lass in a summer dress with her arms raised and pointed out that their razors could get rid of "unsightly hair". Dixie Cups were marketed as sanitary, replacing personal, folding, reusable cups. The porn industry is directly responsible for the fetish of men and women shaving and waxing the nether regions.<br><br>I used to run a vacuum repair and sales shop. So I can tell you that (with the exception of those who are overly sensitive to allergens) the HEPA filtration is a marketing gimmick. The more layers of filtration you add to a vacuum system, the less the airflow, the less the cleaning power. Add to that, they lock you in to buying $60 plus filters every six months at the least. As most of the newer units are all plastic, the lifespan of the machine is a few years at most. Oh, and "amps" are used as another marketing racket. The size and design of the fan (again- airflow) is far more important, but it ain't sexy.<br><br>The much maligned Kirbys and Electrolux are far better, although I recommend the older models. Kirby went self-propelled with a transmission (prone to failure) and the Lux went to a plastic shell (prone to breakage) Royal however, still makes its all-metal units. It is the same basic design since the 40s or 50s, is easy to work on, and virtually indestructible. <br><br>I once rebuilt a 40s Kirby model 505. When the elderly lady brought it in, it still ran, although the bearings screamed and the carbon brushes arced) When I was done, it was good for another 30 years. <br><br>I have repaired friends and neighbors machines many times. I have often thought of going back into the business (and appliances) as a plan B.<br><br>But I suppose the day will arrive when the electric grid is unstable, and wall-to-wall carpet will be replaced with wood and throw-rugs. Maybe I need to coppice some ash and hickory and plant broom-corn as a plan C.

I’ve noticed recently that blades are becoming harder to find, dull faster, and are much thinner than years past, so planned obsolescence penetrates ever deeper it seems.

Quality steel frames are now made only by small volume independent makers. The large volume of "high end" bikes are either composite material or aluminum, neither of which can be repaired. I crashed my steel framed bike and put the rear end out of alignment. I took it to an independent frame builder who was able to simply bend it back into alignment. That crash would have destroyed a composite frame, or rendered an aluminum frame unusable and unrepairable. <br><br>As far as the moving parts, many of them are not servicable any more. Wheel bearings use sealed cartridges instead of cup and cone bearings that can be taken apart. The old style bearings require overhauling about once a year, with new grease and a new set of loose ball bearings. Total cost is a couple dollars. While the cartridge bearings do last longer, when they wear out, they need to be replaced at considerable expense. Chances are, the manufacturer changed the design and you have to buy a whole new wheel hub.<br><br>It produces a lot of satisfaction to take a 30-year old bike apart, clean and lube the parts, put it back together, and know that it will last another 30 years. <br><br><br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c8057507755029578095 title="comment permalink">2/19/15, 10:07 AM</a><br><br>

But you lose grain, dairy, sugar, alcohol, and legumes. It occurred to me a month after making the lifestyle change, because that's what it truly is (and losing eleven pounds the first month) that besides allowing one to cut off all ties to the industrial agriculture machine because you're no longer eating from that poisoned trough, with the right planning and some chickens and rabbits, people could conceivably grow all their own food, or most of it, anyway. I've been working on teaching myself how to feed us from the yard since 2008 and this year I'm going to try to step up my game by putting more of the yard into production and doing a better job of planning and planting for fall and winter vegetables. Besides being a healthier way to eat (see The Paleo Approach, by Sarah Ballantyne, PhD for an in-depth explanation of how human digestion works, including the interaction of the immune system and hormones with digestion and health, etc.), I really think that it's the way forward for food security and self-reliance.

I suggest doing away with the spring part of that ritual and in a dozen years it will be light all night long and think of all the electricity we can save. For the much too serious here I better mention, that’s a joke.<br>We will do modern things until we can’t. Then we will make accommodations to maximize happiness and minimize effort. We are a lazy bunch at best. I am an old guy and remember well how to live in the ‘50s and before. My grandsons are smart enough to pick up on growing food as I have them working in my garden between texts and tweets.<br>I’m sure the irony is not missed that we are using the Internet for an intellectual discussion about going back to living at an earlier time. It should be noted that we have twice as many people in the US to feed and entertain as we did in 1950. “If half you people would go away, we would get along fine.” I will certainly be in the half that is to go away, but now I have work to do in the shop.

The outcomes from that meditation are:<br><br>- People who are clearly unable to accept the concept of limitations will no longer be able to bend my ear about their financial problems. I will simply cut them off. Nuff said;<br><br>- I'm going to head in towards the big smoke and join a few groups there to see if any of them are actually well managed. I basically need more experience before setting up a group. If anyone has any suggestions, I'd certainly appreciate them? and<br><br>- It seems as though a thorough reading of Roberts rules of order may be time well spent.<br><br>One of the commonalities that struck me was that in all of the various groups, the leadership clearly lacked the ability to lead and yet at the same time were unable to recognise that fact and let go of that role. The groups in turn become senile (is that the correct word?). Yes, after summer comes winter is my thinking, before another summer rolls around.<br><br>One of the guilty pleasures that I enjoy, is that after my earlier experience with the big end of town, I now solely work with small business. That is where the leaders are in the community as those people live week to week by their decisions and they hold themselves accountable for the actions of their businesses as do I. It is very inspiring and a breath of fresh air after the la la land of the big end of town.<br><br>PS: Please spare a thought for the people of Queensland as the cyclone coming in from the east has been upgraded to Category 5 and will make landfall this morning. The winds are estimated to be up around 295km/h (183 miles/hour) - that is not good and is about as big and nasty as it gets: <a href=http://www.weatherzone.com.au/news/tropical-cyclone-marcia-storm-strengthens-to-category-five-off-queensland-evacuations-ordered/244930 rel=nofollow>Tropical Cyclone Marcia: Storm strengthens to category five off Queensland, evacuations ordered</a><br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br>Hi Angus,<br><br>Well done.

Precisely for the mentioned reasons. Besides being cheaper and better, safety razors are also easier to sanitise. Just disassemble the device and rinse the parts. Try that with the "system shavers" - no way. Pieces of skin and hair keep stuck inside, and that organic matter will rot in the moisture of a bathroom. No wonder that this infectious mass leads to pimples.<br><br>Shaving soap isn't just cheaper, it works better because it is real soap, i.e. alkaline. So it softens the hair to be shaved, something canned foam doesn't do. Canned foam is to shaving soap what winter strawberries are to real strawberries, a surrogate.<br><br>On the other hand, the safety razor was indeed a better product that the razor knife - the proof is that men were able to shave themselves with the safety razor while it took a specialist (the barber) to get shaved with a razor knife.<br><br>An interesting side-note: Why did so many men suddenly turn to shaving at all? Well, because beards didn't work well with gas masks, and the latter turned out to be a necessity in the chemical warfare of WW1. Before, soldiers usually had beards.<br><br><br>@ Shane: Actually, using a safety razor is really easy. There are just some things to pay attention to:<br><br>- decide whether you want an open or a closed style razor. Open ones look like a comb, closed ones have a solid ridge. Open ones are better suited if you may have to deal with some-days-beard, and they don't take away all the foam by the first brush. Closed ones are a bit safer. I have always been preferring the open style.<br><br>- use hot water (soak a flannel in it and put it on the face) for about a minute. Meanwhile, use the brush to make soap foam. Apply the foam to the face and let it soften the skin for half a minute or a minute. Hint: take a hot shower (start with your face), then shave.<br><br>- Do NOT press the device onto the skin. NEVER. This will result in some bleeding. If you think you have to press it down because it doesn't work, either your blade is blunt (hint: avoid W*lk*nson blades) or you have to proceed to the next point.<br><br>- you must find the right angle between device and skin yourself.<br><br>- do NOT shave across the grain, at least not in the beginning. Shave with the grain first, then in a 90° angle to the grain.<br><br>- clean your face after shaving using cold water.<br><br>- stop possible bleedings using an alum stick (I did need it initially some times, but that will pass with more training).<br><br>- disinfect with aftershave.<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c4653533507292271258 title="comment permalink">2/19/15, 12:22 PM</a><br><br>

Composers, from Hildegard von Bingen and Josquin des Pres through Vivaldi, Bach, Mozart, Beethoven et al., down to Stravinsky and Debussy, followed the basic idea of having one note that is "home", that the music spirals out from and then returns towards.<br><br>In 1908, along came Arnold Schoenberg. He threw out the concept of the tonal center, and gave all 12 notes of the chromatic scale equal importance. Revolutionary! Truly this is the music of the future! What, you don't enjoy listening to it? Then you must be an un-cultured, un-educated Luddite! (Or a Nazi, or a Communist, they didn't like it either.)<br><br>In Schoenberg's footsteps, composers like Alban Berg and John Cage started writing works that can only be described as "weird". (<i>4'33"</i>, anyone?)<br><br>Meanwhile, other composers (notably Ralph Vaughan Williams, Sergey Prokofiev, Aaron Copland) kept the ideas of tonality and melody. Guess whose works are more performed today?<br><br>Also, guess what works composed in the last ten years sound like? The vast majority are tonal, in one way or another. It's not a complete throwback - there are a lot of new styles and techniques being incorporated - but the idea of "progress" in the direction of atonality ultimately failed to pan out.<br><br>Today, most composers seem to draw inspiration from whatever they happen to like, and then try to combine those elements into something they hope will speak to others. Pure innovation is not so much valued anymore, at least not outside very academic circles. And composers borrow un-ashamedly from "pop music" and other sources.<br><br>The whole thing is a rather apt (if abstruse) metaphor for technology, IMO. Segways might be the innovative personal transportation of the future, but I don't see people riding them around campus. I do, however, see bikes with LED lights on them, and occasionally carbon-fiber frames. Or I could use more examples from music, looking at the instruments themselves - laminated soundboards, various composite materials, new alloys, onboard pickups for electronic amplification, better key configurations, etc. But the bicycles, and the musical instruments, do pretty much what they've always done. Old technologies, new embellishments.<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c8679383636741567519 title="comment permalink">2/19/15, 1:09 PM</a><br><br>

Look at China's deliberate abandonment of a maritime empire in the 15th century, Japan's abandonment of firearms and withdrawal from international trade in the Tokugawa period, Britain's relinquishment of its empire after the Second World War -- well, I could go on. Scaling down complexity is a step that a great many societies have taken in the past; it's only unthinkable to those who refuse to think about it. <br><br>Raven, fair enough -- you're in the contest. <br><br>Mickey, I think there's more to it than that, and will be discussing the matter further as we proceed. <br><br>Ed, it's easy to insist in advance that nothing can be done, and that also makes an effective self-fulfilling prophecy.

It takes no longer to brew a good pot the other way, and anyway the machine was relatively expensive and dependent on some sort of microprocessor she cannot repair. K-cups are a right silly concept. There aren't single-serve at all. There's concentrated-enough coffee in them for two or three cups (in fact, the first cup always seems too strong), but the machine doesn't have an option to use the cups for a pot, so you end up making multiple single cups, re-boiling the water each time, or (gasp!) throwing away a perfectly good cup of coffee after only one cup.<br><br>Similarly, at the coffee shop, there was a COLOSSAL unabridged Webster's dictionary. I'd only seen one at libraries and never gotten to hold on before. It was absolutely fantastic, with all manner of illustrations, footnotes, and keys for reading. Sort of like a combination dictionary-encyclopedia. However... it was near one hundred years old, and I made a couple tiny tears in the yellowed pages simply by turning them. I thought, "oh no! And they're out of print! And the Oxford ones just stopped printing as well!"<br><br>Are there any colossal dictionaries still printing? My future children are unlikely to be interested, but it could certainly be a worthwhile end-of-life comfort.<br><br>People who are re-learning the Press: I hope you give these grand books some consideration.

Even though use of Irish was eventually banned in prison communications, Irish remained very much what one friend described to me later as the language of rebellion. I’ve shared that story with my kids, who have determined that cursive writing in English might serve the same purpose in the near future, as it’s no longer being taught in most schools--at least not the ones around here.

His books on organic gardening are among my treasures. <br><br>Jonathan, that's a fascinating theory. If I understand it correctly, what you're suggesting is that the driving force behind much of what gets labeled progress is the ease with which complexity allows costs to be externalized -- loaded onto the community or biosphere as a whole -- in order to increase profits. Hmm, and hmm again. That's going to want some close study and thought, but if you're right -- and the concept passes the initial sniff test -- that may be absolutely crucial. <br><br>Mr. G, if that's the style of retro that appeals to you, by all means!<br><br>Professor D., be careful -- when you say that polyethylene is more economical than glass because glass breaks, are you factoring in the entire supply chain of both products? If not, your analysis isn't useful in the kind of whole systems assessment that needs to be done. <br><br>Greg, that's a good point. <br><br>Gwizard, of course -- and for those who simply prefer beardlessness, too, a safety razor and soap is a blessing. <br><br>Trippticket, you do realize, don't you, that having fun with less technology is far and away the most radical thing you can do in today's society? Congratulations, you dangerous subversive. As for the relationship between insanity and progress, did I say they were two different things? <br><br>Robert, that's a good point -- technology in the service of getting things out of the way. One problem with that attitude, of course, is that if you take it to its natural extreme, being alive is one of the things you get out of the way. <br><br>Trippticket, glad to hear it. Discursive meditation, to give it its proper name, really is better suited to a lot of Western minds, which is why -- until the Theosophical Society popularized Asian mind-emptying meditation in the West -- nearly all Western spiritual traditions used it. <br><br>Chris, excellent! You get today's gold star for engaging in the taboo practice of thinking things through. You're quite right, of course; "progress" implies a "toward what?", just as "consciousness" implies an "of what?"<br><br>Sweaterman, by all means send it around.

I was coming out of my intense corporate career years and decided I wanted to do some "giving-back". Seems embarrassing in retrospect, but anyway I spent time with three small groups, doing local environmental stewardship type projects. <br><br>I was a project manager by trade, and can get quite goal-oriented and specific and directing. At first the groups loved this, thinking I was going to help them get things done. They usually stayed with me through the phase of me writing up detailed goals and plans for particular projects, but then mostly edged away from me when it came to me asking them to do things, and more so when I complained that they weren't doing said things. At first I tried various methods of asking nicely. But when this didn't work, I usually ended up trying to do the activities myself, with the eventual result that I had to get out of that space after a few years, exhausted and a little embittered. <br><br>Recounting the experience to a wiser colleague a few years later he opined that small community groups are often full of collegial and friendly personalities who are interested in the fellowship and community, and who aren't really there to get things done. Or if they are they want the process to be very smooth and consensual. My driven style was just not going to work there. OTH, I would expect larger, higher profile groups to be much more interested in getting things done, and would have a higher contingent of personality types that can handle a more structured and driven process. <br><br>Looking back on my experience from the distance of a number of years, I now realize it was a good for me, helping me to realize that there is a great deal of benefit in just slowing down and vegging-out sometimes.

I used to enjoy the hot lather I got from putting a splash of water from the teakettle into the mug and whipping it up, having splashed my face with plenty of ordinary hot water first. <br><br>Robert, that's possible -- but I wonder how much of it is simply the common mental tic these days that leads people to pay more attention to collecting data than to understanding it. <br><br>Andy, "technologies of extrication" is a fine coinage, and a concept worth contemplating. Thank you!<br><br>Steve, two things I've learned about diets, mostly from living in a society (ours) that's profoundly neurotic about food, is, first, that different people thrive on different diets, and second, that making <i>any</i> serious, sustained change in diet, no matter what the change might be, makes most people feel better for about six months or so. If the paleo diet makes you feel great, wonderful; you might revisit it toward fall and see if it's the diet itself, or simply doing something different and being more conscious about food. <br><br>Yupped, the crucial thing to my mind is treating it as a decision you can make, rather than just doing what you're told to do by the media. <br><br>AntEater, excellent. Yes, that's a crucial point, and it's also a good example of a broader issue, which is the whole-system cost of any given technology in terms of any variable you care to name. If it's cheap to buy the initial unit but you pay buckets for supplies, it's not cheap; if it's fast to use but takes lots of time to clean and service, not to mention to earn the money to pay for it, it's not fast; if it's green and sustainable in terms of its effect in your home and yard but requires huge amounts of pollution and resource depletion elsewhere, it's not green and sustainable. Getting that through some people's heads takes work!<br><br>DM, I've got Windows XP on both my computers now -- that's the standard software that the techs at the local used-computer shops load onto reconditioned machines, for good reason. Enjoy your soon-to-arrive safety razor!<br><br>Zach, congrats on the publishing project, not to mention the rest of it. At this stage of the game, all (or almost all) of us have to have a foot in both worlds; the point to watch is which way you're shifting your weight. <br><br>Cathy, oh, granted. I wonder how long it will take before some enterprising young legal assistants set themselves up offering "we can translate out of legalese" services in storefronts, to provide exactly the kind of services that many lawyers provided before the industry got so greedy. <br><br>Tony, excellent! You get tonight's gold star for catching on to one of the next steps in the discussion well in advance. <br><br>Ghung, exactly. It's already biting a lot of people in various sensitive locations, and the teeth are clamping down more tightly every year. <br><br>Matt, glad to hear it!<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c4158278383647985482 title="comment permalink">2/19/15, 4:02 PM</a><br><br>

My wife and I still use the hand-operated can opener we bought, used, before we got married going on thirty-one years ago.

I don't expect ever to need a shave again, but should that change, I plan on trying a professional shave from a capable barber at least once. <br><br>Rashakor, the very short form is that the left coast was (a) very expensive to live in, (b) increasingly crowded, and (c) deeply invested in (or infested with!) a hypocritical faux-green self-righteousness that I found overwhelmingly tiresome. Oregon was one of the two places I used to see gargantuan SUVs bearing bumper stickers saying "Live Simply That Others Might Simply Live," and it's also where I walked past a house with a lavish solar panel system on the side of the roof facing the street, which happened to be the north side, so that everyone could see it as they drove past in their overpriced hybrids. Those are only two small details out of a much broader cultural milieu. Of course the fact that I could buy a house where I live now for 10% of what an identical house would have cost me in the Portland area had something to do with it as well!<br><br>William, in your place, I'd definitely start planting broom corn, and learning to make brooms the traditional way.

I'm waiting for somebody with mechanical skill and a bit of entrepreneurial flair to bring out a simple, inexpensive tabletop printing press for a reasonable price -- there's a substantial market for that right now, such that old presses have been bid up to preposterous prices recently. Also, very good -- you're in the contest. <br><br>RPC, okay, that one deserves one of my very rare second gold stars in a single evening. Excellent! And quite correct, too -- akin to the bizarre way that evolution gets redefined as progress, so that what's a random process of adaptation to circumstances suddenly becomes a teleological movement toward "the better" -- than what? Nobody says. <br><br>Justin, there you are!<br><br>Paula, I was hoping we'd hear from the distaff side as well. Good -- and of course natural deodorants also don't include large doses of aluminum, which has been implicated in Alzheimer's. <br><br>Onething, thank you for "Everyone wants to solve problems at the outer level, when the real problem is that people are idiots who don't think" -- a fine summary of the problem! I'd encourage you to get someone to put that on the business end of a branding iron and apply it liberally to those who need to learn it. <br><br>Paula, as I mentioned to another paleo-eater above, I've noticed that any dietary change seems to make people feel better for around six months. I've also noticed that the more forcefully people evangelize for a diet, the more people seem to have serious problems if they stay on it -- the pale, gaunt, gets-every-cold-that-comes-through-town vegan who's constantly pushing the vegan diet on everyone he or she knows is a tolerably familiar type these days. I hope the paleo diet doesn't attract the same sort of behavior!<br><br>William, your dad was a smart man. <br><br>Kayr, it's definitely something that takes practice, and sustained development of the skills of self-knowledge as well. After all, if it were easy to see through the myths of industrial society, would we be in this mess at all? <br><br>Lewis, doesn't seem over the top to me at all. A good tool deserves affection!<br><br>Neo, oh, granted -- I should have included the paranoid response as well. <br><br>Lynford, true, but if some of us stop using modern things before we have to, it's going to make it easier to have non-modern things, and people who know how to use them, around to pick up some of the slack.<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c7446392407439995170 title="comment permalink">2/19/15, 5:00 PM</a><br><br>

I'm reminded of JMG'S posts a while back on eschatology, progress, and apocalypse. The whole paleo thing reeks of the whole veneration of Hunter/gatherer, the supposed Eden that we fell from when evil civilization came along. The irritating thing is that a lot of these people think they're venerating nature, when, in all reality, they're venerating Man, just like any other secular humanist/athiest. (Descending from soapbox) My problem with paleo is that you have to basically divorce yourself from your culture regarding food, since wheat and other forbidden products are essential parts of the European and Middle Eastern diet for millennia. Rejecting industrial agriculture is one thing, divorcing your culture's food heritage is another.<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c343706373580944677 title="comment permalink">2/19/15, 5:35 PM</a><br><br>

Some of the most ominous words are "well, we have to do SOMETHING!", which is usually a prelude to a muddled foolish response to a problem which may or may not exist, when the appearance of solving problems gets more points than thinking it through and possibly just leaving things as they are. <br>My mother used to volunteer at the polling place in the small town where I grew up in Connecticut. After the 2000 election with the hanging chads they had to "do something," so legislation was passed to pay for electronic voting equipment. The mechanical lever machines were scrapped after at least 60 years of flawless service. <br>I just went back and reread TJs comment with Wendell Berry's nine requirements to be met before replacing old technology with new, and the electronic voting machines fail every requirement. The old machines were easily understood and fixed by someone local, but try finding a software expert on the premises at 5:00 A.M.<br>I remember pointing out to people that we were solving a problem that didn't exist and the usual response was that the old machines were so obsolete they were embarrassing.<br>I think the words "well, we have to do SOMETHING" are a kind of corollary to the Religion of Progress.<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c4249144547133667335 title="comment permalink">2/19/15, 5:58 PM</a><br><br>

As for Queensland, ouch -- not good at all. I hope everyone in harm's way has done the smart thing and evacuated. <br><br>Daelach, I didn't even think of the sanitary dimension, but of course you're quite right. <br><br>Mike, if you're ready to do that, do it. "Collapse now and avoid the rush" is still the best strategy I've found. <br><br>Gwaiharad, the entire notion that art "progresses" deserves to be mocked by an Irish bard until the earth opens at its feet and swallows it once and for all. The Iliad was not rendered obsolete by Beowulf, nor is a painting by Leonardo outmoded because of Rembrandt -- and of course that's equally true about music. As fas as Schoenberg et al. are concerned, I've long admired the satiric book on culture that noted that orchestras play 20th century avant-garde music when they want to dispense with the inconvenience of having an audience. <br><br>Carnegie, have you considered getting into printing yourself? If something you value is going to happen, it's probably going to happen because you did it, you know. <br><br>Kathleen, excellent -- long live the cursive revolution!<br><br>Phil, okay, I missed that -- though I could certainly handle a bicycle tour drinking local cider. I found myself quite unexpectedly developing a taste for Somerset scrumpy while visiting Glastonbury last June. As for the Shakers, no argument there!<br><br>Avalterra, congratulations! That's got to have been a big step, as well as a very important one. BTW, I owe you an apology, and a public hat tip -- when I was putting together the Squirrel Case Challenge, I didn't remember off hand who'd suggested it and couldn't find the comment you'd made -- admittedly I was in a hurry, due to page proofs on two book projects that had to be done at the same time. I'll remedy that when the results are announced. <br><br>Shane, in some areas it's already happening -- look at the legal persecution of organic gardeners, alternative health care, and so on. I expect it'll accelerate for a while, and then collapse as other problems become far more pressing. <br><br>Sgage, no argument there. And -- ahem -- ladies, no need for you to practice the same bizarre habit either, you know. <br><br>Kyoto, I've noticed that. A year ago, I was still getting maybe half a dozen comments Wednesday night before I went to bed -- now it's 20 to 30. BTW, "Progress is obviously a construct of the dominant players in the market place" is a very nice, terse summary -- thank you.<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c1888565488506328640 title="comment permalink">2/19/15, 7:23 PM</a><br><br>

As for the paleo diet, yes, I've seen a certain amount of the same strident intolerance for disagreement out of the paleo scene that's made the whole issue of vegan diets so dreary; my wife has celiac disease, and half the online celiac forums are swamped with paleo trolls who go in for hate-filled personal abuse the moment anyone fails to follow their dietary dicta. <br><br>Other Tom, excellent -- yes, that's a good one to keep in mind. "No, we don't" is often a very wise counsel!<br><br>Olduvaiguy, it's a complex issue. A society may choose to keep one technology with relatively high embedded energy going while letting a lot of others drop, because the one it saves fills an important economic niche and can't be replaced without major discontinuities. A society may also scrap technologies that it could theoretically save, again for social reasons. As for the monastic alternative, there I think you're wrong; the elite is just as bad at systems theory as the rest of us, and once the shrinking of the pie of goods and services becomes too obvious to ignore, my working guess is that the elite will be delighted by neomonasticism and the like, thinking -- however mistakenly -- that this means that there'll be more for them.<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c1664350641897720697 title="comment permalink">2/19/15, 7:32 PM</a><br><br>

I selected the cheapest phone they had, but all they offered were smartphones. I thought I might be able to use it to check e-mail, Google, etc. So far, no luck. The little keyboard screen that pops up to type has such small keys that I constantly type the wrong thing. I tried for about two hours to log into my Hotmail account, and gave up in frustration. Ditto Google. At least it works as a phone. And it has a compass app! How did I ever live without that? At least I'm not stuck in a contract.

The Predator, as the obvious example, is a deeply flawed weapon system that fails utterly in the face of even moderate weather, has targeting systems that he likens to "looking at a battlefield through a straw," and that completely undermines the chain of command by allowing on-the-fly meddling in battlefield tactics from the upper echelons sitting back at base or even in the U.S.<br><br>He describes Operation Anaconda in eastern Afghanistan where the commanding officers continue to make flawed strategic decisions based on the belief that the Predators offer them God-like awareness of the battlefield, even when offered conflicting strategic observations from a pilot observing the battlefield with his own eyes in an AC-10 Warthog. Not surprisingly, this strategic tunnel vision results in the deaths of several American service members.<br><br>To me this highlights an even more fundamental conflict than that of appropriate tech vs. the junk of progress. That is, the conflict between so-called "advanced" technology and human beings themselves.<br><br>As Cockburn says: "The ensuing battle featured almost all aspects of the remote-control high-technology approach to war, notably the abiding faith in remote sensing as a substitute for the human eye. The results were instructive, if tragic."<br><br>I'm looking forward to picking up "Twilight's Last Gleaming" next to check out your vision of how this plays out in our next non-asymmetrical field of battle.<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c7119517049836337446 title="comment permalink">2/20/15, 8:11 AM</a><br><br>

Todays Oregon is a very diverse place with very different geographic cultures. JMG's experiece in Southern Oregon is typical of that area ( Bend Also) which is influenced by California Transplants on big budgets. The mid valley ( Salem, Albany) is essentially midwestern in character. Then there are the old logging towns which are much like appalachian resource extraction towns and then there is Portland. Portland within itself is culturaly diverse with the crowd JMG's dislikes occupying the Southwest Suburbs, while North and North East Portland is poplulated with a growing population of young people actively returning to crafts, food, art, etc of an earlier era while attempting to go car-free. But one thing that JMG has right is that Portland has become expensive , but such is the price of it's current trendiness. I figure it won't take much sliding down the curve of collapse to flatten housing costs. But, mother nature does seem to be favoring us as the climate changes.

It has transformed my world view and made me feel like an alien in the company of nearly everyone I know, all of them bright, knowledgeable believers in progress. I live in the center of the universe, Silicon Valley, where the streets are full of people with their heads bowed over their iPhones. I am very fond of my computer, but I have refused to get a "smart phone" of any kind, because they give me what I don't want (constant availability) and don't give me what I do (good sound quality and simplicity). I like the idea of choosing older and better technologies, but it seems to get harder all the time. I've heard recently that the phone company is thinking of phasing out landlines since "nobody uses them any more." <br><br>Quite a few people in this area have big rooftop PV systems, all of course tied into the grid. I like my small, portable, all-in-one (battery and inverter included) solar panel. Charged up by a few hours in the sun, it will run my laptop for more than nine hours. I know it depends on high-tech materials for its manufacture, but its simplicity and effectiveness make it feel like something that conforms pretty well to Wendell Berry's nine rules, posted by this week's first commenter.

The library profession prides itself on its values of intellectual diversity and anti-censorship, yet quite ironically--so often silences and is hostile to viewpoints that question contemporary technological trends in libraries.<br><br>I'm currently having a dilemma of how to deal with one of four work goals I'm required to complete this year, which I will be evaluated on. It's entitled "New Technology." I am required to pick a technology on a list, learn in depth about it (how it is used and would enhance library services), write a report on it, and then do a project-based program that incorporates or promotes the technology. I looked at the list of technologies, all of which I thoroughly despise, think are making the library a worse and less resilient place, or at best, am simply not passionate about: Social media (Twitter, Facebook, etc.), ActivTable (this large iPad-like table that has recently invaded and debased our children's section), 3-D printer, electronic resources (e-books), mobile apps, etc. I do have the option of proposing a new technology not on the list to do instead (but it would have to be approved by my manager). It annoys me that general programming (such as book clubs, story times, etc.) do not even count for my performance evaluation this year, yet this one kind of program will.<br><br>I don't believe the implicit cultural mythology underlying this goal. I'm thinking about how to complete it in a way that is true to my values. Several ideas: <br><br>1) I could think of a technology not on the list that might enhance library services, and not the kind one usually thinks of as "new" technology--something lower-tech. I'm not sure what that would be. When I see the word "technology," my anthropologist-self thinks of a wider definition than the popular connotation: a paper book, fork, and wheel are all just as much technologies as a computer or mobile phone. <br><br>2) If I somehow get stuck with having to do something on the list, I could complete the goal in a subversive manner. For example, it greatly annoys me how much hype occurs around 3-D printing at the library. All the library programs and articles promoting it give a very one-sided view. If the public library is a place that truly tolerates intellectual diversity and debate, then there should be room for dissenting opinions about 3-D printers. Perhaps I could do some sort of program that counters its endless hype.<br><br>3) If my manager is inflexible in whatever ideas I come up with, then I can be courageous and refuse to complete the goal (risking getting the lowest evaluation score for it). There's no reason I need to go along with it all.<br><br>If any of you have any fun ideas of how I should respond to this work task, please let me know! I'm still trying to figure out what I should do. There may come a time when I decide I'm better off leaving this library system to more freely pursue deindustrial library goals, but in the meantime, I at least want to be true to myself while I continue to work here.<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c187306588732859641 title="comment permalink">2/20/15, 1:12 PM</a><br><br>

I once heard advertising described as the art of creating a need or manufacturing an inadequacy. If someone comes along and builds a better mouse trap then they don't need advertising and marketing because the product will sell itself.<br><br>If, on the other hand, the product is expensive, marginally effective, has numerous and dangerous side effects, like some pharmaceuticals, then you need to advertise it heavily. And not just to the market, you also need to promote it to the doctors or they will go with an older and cheaper product with an established history.<br><br>Since the goal of advertising is to circumvent the rational mind and manipulate the target audience into needing something they never needed before, the best defence is to actively understand the nature of the manipulations.

Therefore, I'm suspicious of any voluntary dietary restriction besides eliminating industrialized processed food. Seems like giving up an evolutionary advantage. Also, in a time of decline, food scarcity, or famine, I'm doubtful of people's ability to maintain their restricted diet. Therefore, they seem to be a luxury of those who can afford to be so selective. <br>I'm also reminded about what JMG said about the misunderstandings about evolution, namely, that Hunter/gatherers are "less evolved", "more primitive", "arrested in time" humans. That Hunter/gatherers are just as evolved and modern to their societies as we are to ours. A friend sent me an article about a guy who performed a fecal transplant with a San bushman, hoping to reset his gut biota 10,000 years. All I could think about reading it was, "how could you explain what you were doing and why you were doing it to the San bushman who's poop you'd unknowingly swapped? You supposedly want to return to the lifestyle of a guy who would find your actions totally baffling and incomprehensible." Granted, I know fecal transplants perform very useful functions for people with gut problems, but I'm not sure that returning your gut to Eden is a solution to a medical issue.<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c3608688412814526551 title="comment permalink">2/20/15, 4:57 PM</a><br><br>

"Just go into the crawl space under your house with a small electric space heater, or light bulb, and warm it up."<br>"INTO the crawl space?" he was horrified.<br>"OK. Then just sit down and wait for me to get there." Ordinarily, it takes about 30 minutes, but because we were starting to get significant snow, it took me an hour. To make a long story short, I showed him where his service cut-off valve was, in case the pipes leaked when they thawed. I explained why his garden tap should be open, and that line shut off from the crawl space, so as not to trap freezing water between two valves. I re-installed the foam- board insulation that was supposed to line the concrete-block foundation. I located a disconnected sanitary drain that was dumping raw sewage into the crawlspace! And the heater(s) eventually thawed the pipes. It took an hour or so.<br>"How can I ever thank you enough for coming out in this storm, and rescuing my house?"<br>"I'd like to take one of your antique inkwells."<br>"That's ALL?!? I'd have given it to you just because I know you'd use it."<br>"And I'd have crawled under your house anyway, just because I knew you needed it."<br> <br>It's a very nice inkwell, a cube of crystal with beveled corners, and a faceted hinged lid. And it does have a little less ink in it now than it did when I first filled it, because I've been keeping my ham radio logbook with a dip pen.<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c3666018503451331921 title="comment permalink">2/20/15, 7:10 PM</a><br><br>

It reminds me of a garden, or a building, or just about any other design…as long as you design for function, good form will almost always follow. A lot of diets are geared toward form…”I need to lose weight.” Eat things that are farmed, raised, fermented, and processed responsibly and health will follow. You won’t be 120 pounds soaking wet, but you will feel good and likely live with more energy, which by the way, helps with the farming and raising of good food. Oh, and also, tending the garden and raising the animals is often significant exercise to burn excess calories, should you need to shed the weight. This should be intuitively obvious to even the most casual observer…even Blind Freddy…<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c1462717559624675928 title="comment permalink">2/20/15, 8:45 PM</a><br><br>

My wife and I used to live just south of Woodland Park Zoo -- it was quite something, hearing the lion roaring in the night -- right next to the Wallingford neighborhood, which is nearly as eco-yuppie a place as Ashland ever was. That's where I first saw that bumper sticker on an SUV -- and no ordinary SUV, either; I don't recall the model but it was huge and, by the way, brand new. <br><br>Mark, thank you. Prine's always worth a listen. <br><br>bdy1, it can be a useful way of thinking!<br><br>SunsetSu, sorry to hear about the surges! I don't know what's available these days, but there used to be shops in Seattle that reconditioned and resold old appliances -- one I patronized a few times, up on Capitol Hill, had the engaging name "Reasonably Honest Dave's" -- and that might be a place to look for a washer with a simple mechanical timer. <br><br>Ray, I'll be discussing printing presses at more length in an upcoming post. If somebody were to go into business manufacturing a good sturdy basic tabletop printing press that could handle 8.5"x11" paper, for a reasonable price, my guess is they'd be swimming in orders pronto. <br><br>Mark, the German language is great that way! As for complexity as a sign of "progress," too true. "Ten times as many things that can go wrong!" <br><br>William, no argument there!<br><br>Crow Hill, and the two have much in common...<br><br>Cherokee, good. In the US, it was in the 1960s that young people stopped joining lodges, clubs, and other voluntary organizations, and so the sort of handbook an aspiring Freemason, Jaycee, Garden Club member, or what have you would need to learn how to run a meeting, etc., lost its market. I may see if I can track down a good book or two along those lines and see about getting a small publisher with access to the Masonic market interested -- we're getting a lot of young members these days, and they could use it. BTW, glad to hear that apparently nobody died in the Queensland storm. <br><br>Gloucon, with all due respect, those may be the lamest excuses I've heard yet. Put a cuphook into the bathroom wall and buy a tin cup to hang from it, if that's really what concerns you. <br><br>Scythe, current notions of "healthy weight" are mostly a product of fashion, plus a diet industry that makes billions of dollars a year convincing people they're too fat. The human body is good at storing away calories for future reference, and yes, a few more pounds can make hungry times easier to live through. (BTW, if you want me to put your other comment through, please delete the abusive language about fat people, and resend it. I know you may not have meant it that way, and that sort of language is very common, but this blog doesn't allow hate speech about body weight, any more than it allows the same thing aimed at race, gender, or anything else.)<br><br>Dagnarus, I prefer no TV at all, but if you have to have one, one that isn't straight out of <i>1984</i> is probably a good idea!<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c1179490123523273410 title="comment permalink">2/20/15, 10:25 PM</a><br><br>

I know, that doesn't make it any easier! I wonder if it might be possible to work out ways for old people who know these skills to teach them to young people who want to learn them. <br><br>Tye, I want to see what happens when the robot's little onboard computer crashes while somebody's wearing the thing. I notice it was designed by a guy from MIT, which just kind of figures. <br><br>Stein, <br><b>Twenty.<br>Million.<br>Lines. <br>Of. <br>Code.</b><br>What a <i>great</i> idea. What could possibly go wrong? <br><br>Leo, I hear stories like that all the time. It's one of the reasons I think progress has passed into the point of negative returns -- for everybody but the shareholders, that is. <br><br>Denys, where's the site? It sounds like the kind of place I'd love to visit. As for the blog, my guess is that you'd have a large and appreciative readership as soon as the word got out. Yes, that's the sort of thing I had in mind, and I think your children will thank you when they're grown for having that kind of upbringing!<br><br>Shane, delighted to hear it. Yes, sometimes it's really shooting fish in a barrel. <br><br>David, and of course nobody's supposed to notice that everyone else is trying to do the same thing, and there aren't enough positions for more than a small fraction of the current middle class. As people do notice that -- and they will -- things are going to get interesting. <br><br>Ed-M, to each his own. I never had a problem with raggedy edges!<br><br>Chester, thanks for this. I'll have to read the book -- it sounds like a very solid case study in what happens when people forget that it's not enough for a new technology to be progressive, exciting, avant-garde, etc. -- it also has to do the job it's supposed to do...<br><br>Karl, it does indeed make sense. Reinventing a past that never was can be a very useful strategy, if it's done deliberately and with a cold eye to the downside; if it's done for emotional reasons by people who can't keep the fantasy separate from the reality, it's a reliable source of ghastly consequences. <br><br>Scotlyn, glad to hear it. With regard to your acupressure skills, have you explored barter as a possibility, exchanging either goods or labor? A lot of people do that these days. <br><br>Peter, that sounds about right! You might also look for what's called a brush whip or grass whip -- it looks vaguely like a golf club with a serrated cutting head on the business end, and can take out weeds, grass, and light brush quite effectively, when swung in your best Arnold Palmer imitation.<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c4822377038678101799 title="comment permalink">2/20/15, 10:44 PM</a><br><br>

I'm going to be riffing off that concept at some length -- with a hat tip, of course -- in a post in the very near future; I think you've caught hold of a crucial point which I'd missed in my earlier analysis. If progress (that is, increasing complexity) functions primarily as a way of pushing off costs onto other people while monopolizing profits, then... Hmm. That implies some very messy consequences for the whole system in the long term. More on this soon!<br><br>Glenn (if I may), of course! Rashakor asked about my reasons, and I gave them; I hope he's also asking people who like the Pacific Northwest and plan on staying there, so as to get a balanced view. <br><br>Bright City, many thanks. While I have my doubts about PV as a long-term solution, for the time being, it's a good choice -- and a simple, small, portable system like the one you've linked to sounds like an even better one. <br><br>Varun, delighted to hear it. Traditional fables are traditional for good reason -- they teach things worth learning, and as you note, they're also much more interesting than the shoddy modern product. <br><br>Beneath, I wish I had something to suggest. As long as library science remains locked into this bizarre technofetish, I suspect you'll be stuck having to fight tooth and nail to hold onto any scrap of what libraries used to be -- which is something considerably more useful to the future than what they're being turned into. I'll have a response to that to propose, down the road a bit, but I don't know that it'll help you much. <br><br>Scythe, good. Blind faith in the invincibility of progress is right down there at the core of the modern mind, and getting anyone to shake off the trance is a real challenge, but it's worth the attempt! (BTW, no, I wasn't offended -- I know that the old-fashioned rules of discourse on this comments page take a lot of getting used to.) <br><br>Tim, thanks for this! A fun game for the whole family...<br><br>Chubasco, and that's also an option!<br><br>Shane, no argument there; a lot of fancy restrictive diets are lifestyle accessories of the privileged. Use a mirror to look in your mouth sometime and you'll see the classic dentition of a full-time omnivore: generic incisors in front; carnassials for tearing meat just behind them, where herbivores all have a gap with no teeth at all; low-crowned molars with rounded cusps for grinding the widest possible range of plant-based foods. Ours is a very flexible species, right up there with rats and cockroaches, and like rats and cockroaches, we eat -- and thrive on -- anything that doesn't run away too fast. <br><br>Changeling, that's certainly been my impression -- a huge number of people these days literally can't follow a sequence of clearly described steps, because too much e-technology use has given them the attention span of a gnat.<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c3778610073457661447 title="comment permalink">2/20/15, 11:09 PM</a><br><br>

She was 79, one of the old hippies. I've known her many years, although not well. She picked an inconvenient time to die. Yesterday was the coldest day of the winter. About 5 degrees at the warmest in the afternoon. (That would be -15 celsius.) Various friends from a few miles around came through miles of snowy roads up to her almost inaccessible place, walking the last 1/4 mile with shovels and picks, and dug her a grave. The local funeral home is pretty cooperative and brought her in a coffin from the hospital to their funeral home, where some friends put her coffin in the back of their truck. She didn't have any family here, although her sons made it in today from Texas and Florida. <br>We buried her on her land, way up in the hills, next to her husband. Except, it isn't really her land now. She got too frail to be there herself and took a subsidized apartment in town a couple years back, and sold her land to one of the guys there. <br><br>When we checked out the hole which had been dug yesterday, it was a bit too small, so a couple guys went down with picks and struck at the frozen sides till we shaved off a few more inches.<br><br>There were no officials around. I said that I would rather dispense with even a coffin, and just be buried in a shroud to compost as quickly as possible. Others a greed, and so we joked about it, saying since no one is here watching us, why even use her coffin? Why not save it, pretend to bury one another in it, and then reuse it, since they're expensive. <br>I thought a coffin was a legal requirement, but now I am not sure.<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c9068068367575680912 title="comment permalink">2/20/15, 11:30 PM</a><br><br>

Now switching over to the user, it translates in consuming more time. You have to keep the stuff up to date (or run the risk of security holes - see the BMW connected drive issue I mentioned last week). That's why I don't want a smartphone. One more operating system and applications to take care of.<br><br>There's the good old engineering concept of "KISS" - keep it simple and stupid. A story from a Russian aircraft manufacturer who was constructing a fire extinguishing aircraft: It should fly over some water surface, e.g. a lake, take in water and automatically shut off when the reservoir was full. The engineers tinkered with sensors, actuators and stuff, which in the end would have cost as much as a whole wing. "Too expensive", the management said, "go back to your whiteboards and figure out something cheaper".<br><br>So the engineers came up with welding a u-shaped tube onto the top of the reservoir plus a rearview mirror for the pilot, so when the reservoir got full, water would splash out of the tube, the pilot would see it and go off to the fire place. No electronics, no actuators, no maintenance items, just simple physics. Russian technology usually lacks the refinement of Western products, and under good conditions, Western products are mostly superior. But under harsh conditions, the Russian things keep operating while Western stuff just fails.<br><br>Now when I had completed my wool blanket poncho, I found out that in winter, the forearms got cold. I thought about sewing some arm warmers, but elastic tissue would not keep the wind off while rigid tissue would not go over the hand AND sit tight. A buttoned solution would make me stick with the other clothes.<br><br>In the light of what I just told, I sat back and asked myself "how would a Russian solve this?". Then I remembered that the Russian military did not have socks for the soldiers until 2013; instead, they used foot bandages. Easier to manufacture, one-size-fits-all, can be cooked in boiling water if made from appropriate material, the wear can be split to different points because it can be wrapped around the foot in several orientations.

Perhaps, the number of patents issued in a given year might be a useful measure of progress. There might be other useful measures of progress such as perhaps the number of scientific papers published in all the world's scientific journals in any given year. <br>In any case, I would guess that if we plotted progress by whatever metric we chose, against time, we would get a curve very much like the Hubbard curve. The Hubbard curve is of course the plot of oil production vs. time and resembles a nice bell shaped curve.<br>As Ugo Bardi has pointed out, the Hubbard curve might not be entirely accurate for total world energy production. Bardi has proposed the concept of the Seneca cliff. The idea is that growth of energy production is more gradual than decline of energy production and will be a lot more rapid on the way down than on the way up.<br>The correlation between progress and energy consumption might be questioned, but if there is a correlation, then we could expect progress to peak somewhere near the peak of oil production and decline afterward, giving us peak progress.<br>Absent energy, progress stalls. But progress as in the religion of progress is expected to be ever increasing. And in Ray Kurzweil's sect of the religion, progress will even go through something like the rapture of the Christians, something he calls the singularity.<br>Peak progress like peak oil does not mean the end of progress, it simply means that there will be less progress every year with less cheap energy available to fuel it.<br>Believers in the religion of progress will object that progress does not need energy to move forward, that isolated individual in garrets or garages or basements can still be moving progress forward. But at what rate will they be able to do that. Lone individuals in garrets will not build Hadron colliders or space programs.<br>Regardless of what progress means to people, it might be useful to define it is such a way that it is measurable and can be plotted vs. time.<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c4112549011184972024 title="comment permalink">2/21/15, 7:48 AM</a><br><br>

If that control shifts to everyone in a way that honors democracy and face to face interactions, Empire is weakened.

And this happened: one of the lecturers during previous semester basically told or implied all questions that appeared on the exam. Yet, something around 1/3 of all students failed the first time they were offered this test. So, I wonder - how far even attention or basic learning skill (like paying attention) are damaged by modern technology? I know some school teachers that are complaining about drastic drop in attention spans of children with smartphones."<br><br>You hear quite often these days that children in school seem to be having an increasingly hard time learning anything at all, and that, for a significant number of people in industrial civilization, the ability for any kind of sustained effort is greatly hampered by their own lack of attention span. Whenever this is brought up, what always seem to be left out of the discussion is the very nature and purpose of the education that their industrial society insists on putting its young ones through. The cultivation of insight, skill and the ability to actually think is being systematically eliminated, and education as such pretty much amounts to enforcing mindless consumption of whatever narratives that can be relied on to make people into the dolts that contemporary western society needs them to be, while bleeding their purses to pay for an increasingly arrogant and useless academic superstructure. But then of course, the students would not want it any other way. During the time I spent in college, a recurring theme was that whenever a teacher or class was geared toward teaching some actual skill, that would reliably offend the bejesus out of the students, whose whining would inevitably take the form of progress rhetoric, insisting that skill had been rendered obsolete by technology, and in many cases they petitioned to have the teacher fired for his or her audacity. As with so much that is going on around us, the ego's wholly disproportionate sense of entitlement that you accurately mentioned in response to a comment I made on your other blog a while back seems to be calling the shots here too.<br><br>On another note, being inspired to seek out a proper shave, I sought out an online store I knew could be counted on to stock high quality shaving equipment, and was surprised to learn: “All items out of stock.

The kids would know more about the technologies and could clue you in. Might make it easier. (2) Groups/Clubs of interest (including literary societies, volunteers, reinactment groups!) - practically all of the technologies you mentioned could be used here. Social media for obvious reasons. (One website that is a example of pulling together related yet diverse interests is http://www.janeausten.org/ - maybe that will help with some ideas for using the different technoloties). (3) Come up with a (better) plan for getting e-books to the home bound. Incidentally, e-books can be useful for the visually impaired who can use the technology to magnify the size of the font. (4) Coordinating volunteers, setting up classes to explain and use these technologies . There are lots of people who NEED to learn this stuff (practical or not), as it's practically a requirement to get/keep a job these days. It might even help to informally ask around what would be useful.<br>The key, I think, is to serve more people and improve services with the same number of employees. I just hope they aren't thinking about using these technologies as an excuse to cut back on staff. If this is the case, come up with a plan that is wonderful sounding but impossible (as in funding would/could never be approved, one hopes), so obviously expensive (purchase, maintain, upgrade, etc.) that it would be regretfully turned because the present system works so much better; kind of a squirrel challenge for librarians.

I agree it is hyped but it is not all bad. It gets the foot in the door with making things yourself and finding out how well you can fail. That is a very important lesson I think. It also gets you off the sofa a tiny bit. I prefer more manual stuff but there's a limit to how often my wife will let me turn the living room into a wood work shop. Each good piece of furniture gets me +1, each bad piece -2. Also, I am running out of places to hide my tools and materials in. If I imagine I'd had to get to the point I am now, starting with the shabby tools I could get my hands on in my parents place (also no work space to speak of) in more or less dense urban housing, while doing it on a hobby basis, it probably would not have worked out. I'd be sitting in a bank or ad office. If 3D printing gets you to a place where they have decent hand tools, I say more power to it. Regarding the hype I would be interested how much plastic they sell over the years for each printer they sold. I don't think it is much. Then do a tiny survey and check what were the last 10 things typically printed and you'll probably get a more realistic picture of consumer level impact. I haven't heard Bayer, BASF, DOW, and the likes getting all excited due to increased plastic sales...<br>Bottom line: I'd say libraries are not the first choice of places for 3D printers.

I've used it to shovel close to a foot of snow at one go though it's best to do intermediate shovelings every time a few inches fall if you're getting that much snow (we rarely do in St. Louis). It works way better than a snow blower in most kinds of snow we get around here, which tend to have sleet mixed in, as did yesterday's storm.

Of course, a GPS was required because the map section didn't give maps until authorized by the regional accounting office (a three month process). <br><br>These true stories says everything about false accounting and false economy even on the very restricted terms of just looking at money. <br><br>If we were to broaden costs to include all true costs to the environment and society, and not be allowed to externalize them, my guess is that just about any large industrial enterprise (or those activities reliant on them) would not be viable. <br><br>I'll go even further to hazard that externalizing such unacceptable costs, and centralizing the benefits to a select group of humans (that may not include any of us), is what industrial society has been all about from the start. Hiding the true costs and benefits is the foundational lie of our civilization. “Progress” has been the most successful way of marketing this lie. Its been all the more successful because, like any good lie, its partly true. Some of the benefits have been very real.<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c2781502306950121890 title="comment permalink">2/21/15, 1:37 PM</a><br><br>

[...] -- that may be absolutely crucial."<br><br>Yes! I might substitute "pollution" for "costs", but yes. So then -- what is going on, what big picture does that suggest (because I get bored thinking about shaving too long)? At the risk, among others, of being deterministic, I guess for me it starts to feel like: homo sapiens unearths the boon/bane of earth's black blood....could've been a ring of power -- what it does is it both amplifies and changes our role in the system. What do we end up doing, when all is said and done? <br><br>Seems like we end up... unearthing more stuff, accelerating the process just as fast as our ring of power will allow. So assiduously as to make our friendly competitors the termites and worker ants stamp their little feet in shame, we uproot Earth's mineral bones, appropriate the rest of the biosphere (not just the black blood but the living skin too) to fuel our endeavor, and we reshape the world we found into "our" world of alloys and plastics and SKUs and acid oceans and carbonized skies and some level of mass extinction.<br><br>Ok. So what has happened? What's happened is we've been converted by the earth -- by being touched by its black blood -- into a catalyst, an agent, in a reaction that in essence, I suppose, functions to render a portion of the earth's relatively simple, dense mineral/chemical composition out into various new sorts of molecules strewn throughout the biosphere and atmosphere. There's been a mining and exhaustion operation going on, and the biosphere has in effect been recruited by earth itself to perform it. <br><br>Maybe we even take an industrial-scale stab at albedo modification and end up getting quite a lot more of what was formerly in the corpus out into the surroundings. So the earth has, in short, undergone a self-catalyzed decomposition operation. The profit motive, in this view, is thus nothing more than the means of catalysis -- the path taken by the black blood to animate us to play our role. Call us brilliant captains of industry or brain-dead zombies, we do what we do and the oil makes it happen.<br><br>(continued)<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c221397937521935852 title="comment permalink">2/21/15, 7:55 PM</a><br><br>

Spreading out whatever is solid and substantial and full of embedded "potential energy" into dispersed, cold atoms. And given that thermodynamics, as I understand it, also gives "time" and "directionality" whatever meaning it has, that's as close as I am able to come to something I see as approximating the universe "expressing its will" -- or, at least, "unfolding".<br><br>I'd be excited to hear JMG's or anyone else's reaction and whether he or anyone else sees the story, told that way, as a basis for any sort of spiritual posture.

Calibrating in hours might well be a good approach.

It was the mid-90s, and I was coming of age and starting to shave my face. My father bought me a brand new handheld electric shaver that cost somewhere around $30 as either a birthday or Christmas present. The fine hair of a young boy is exceedingly difficult to shave and requires a very sharp implement so this electric shaver didn't work for beans. I asked my dad if it worked and he tested it on his stubble of a few days and replied yes, but his stubble was still there, just shorter on the side he used to test the shaver. Something about a the cognitive dissonance of a brand new electric shaver that didn't shave well combined with the relatively elastic mind of youth lead to the understanding that not all newer things were better. Next I tried a disposable safety razor. It was sharp, and worked quite well. I have been using these for years thinking I had my shaving requirement elegantly provided for. Your post reminded me that I still had my dad's metal safety razor under the sink. I'm looking forward to upgrading my shaving experience, especially since I had never before heard of shaving soap. Thanks for the tip.<br><br>For a while I lived in a city suburb and had to mow a back lawn the size of a large room, so I would borrow the rental company's reel mower, later getting my own and learning to sharpen and adjust it. One day I was mowing and my neighbor's children came and asked me what I was doing, and I replied that I was cutting lawn with a lawnmower that didn't use any gas. After the incredulous expressions and utterances, I let them try it themselves, which they were just barely able to do by putting both their weights into it. They both seemed to be particularly excited that grass could be cut without gas. I hope I was able to dent the myth of progress within their minds, to open a crack into which appropriate technology might worm its way in. I also hope that my stories provide some hope for JMG's readers - there are a great number of young minds that have not yet been indoctrinated into Progress. Even after exposure it doesn't always take within each one - particularly as Progress' claims gets more and more difficult to square with observed reality.<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c8752248796675692537 title="comment permalink">2/21/15, 9:15 PM</a><br><br>

The Volt and other vehicles of its type have an electric motor, a battery to supply the motor with juice, a gasoline engine (or two) to recharge the battery, plus regenerative braking to turn the kinetic energy of the car's forward motion into current by reconfiguring the electric motor as a generator that recharges the battery while slowing the car down. <br><br>In order for the vehicle to be energy efficient despite the extra weight of these redundant systems, the operation of these devices has to be blended and coordinated through varying rates of acceleration and deceleration with precision and quickness. One could conceivably develop the muscle memory to do this manually while paying attention to the road, but it probably would take an airplane pilot's level of training and still wouldn't do the job as well as computers can. Given that the average American driver prefers an automatic transmission to a stick shift, and can't do double clutching, this would be a niche market indeed.<br><br>Obviously you can build a electric powered automobile without a computer--some very early cars were electric, as are golf carts. You can build an internal combustion engine auto without a computer. You can't build a practical hybrid car without computers, which is why there weren't any until a few years ago.<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c4039884187552403719 title="comment permalink">2/22/15, 6:06 AM</a><br><br>

I think the hidden issue is the decline in smoking rates that's taken place at the same time. Basically, trading one vice for another. The worker who smoked at his/her desk all day long while maintaining a "healthy" body weight 20-30 years ago is now a worker who eats junk food at his/her desk instead. The biggest issue that's not addressed is from a systems standpoint: the industrial sedentary lifestyle and industrial food systems. It probably ties back into the theme of externalizing costs. A big part of the industrial food system are diets that, like you said, end up making people bigger than before they began, when all is said and done.<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c3521637829204263580 title="comment permalink">2/22/15, 7:27 AM</a><br><br>

That's why the "super slim in just 8 weeks"-products are useless. You can't live on them permanently, and they don't teach you how to feed. All in all, they are just waste of money.<br><br>The basic and most important trick is to drop anything sugared (permanently!): sweets, soft drinks, fruit juice, processed sugared food. If that isn't enough, reduce the carbs further, ditching also corn products (like bread). Avoid too much fruits and go for vegetables instead. Pay attention to eating enough protein - but you don't need expensive protein powder. Simple real food like trouts will do.<br><br>Sounds easy, huh? It isn't. Sugar acts as a drug, and withdrawal causes severe symptoms; feeling depressive, weak, or instable aggression among them. Not to mention circulation problems with the blood pressure.<br><br>That's not a sign of a weak mind! There are hard bio-chemical facts behind: mainly that the brain, addicted on sugar, needs two or three weeks to re-learn making an enzyme to process the ketone bodies and to take part in the fat metabolism again. Basically, that is the reason for the "Atkins flu". Usually, it is only unpleasurable and not harmful, but especially with very much overweight, medical supervision can be necessary. Preferably by a real doctor (as opposed to salesmen for the pharma industry).<br><br>First basic question: A healthy human with normal weight has enough energy to survive a month without food, and with overweight, even more. But after 12-18 hours without eating, people collapse. Does anyone think that humanity would have made it through the harsh periods with such a malfunctioning body?<br><br>Next basic question: when (when, not if!) access to food becomes intermittent, how will people fair who collapse without three meals per day?<br><br>Besides going down to normal weight, there's another bonus for people with migraine problems: migraine and sugar are closely related. Get your brain back to take part in the fat metabolism (on ketone bodies), and your migraine attacks will either stop completely or at least get greatly reduced both in frequency and severeness. Be prepared, however, that while there is success waving at the end of that route, the way there can be bumpy, attacks can be expected.<br><br>It will be much harder in case you have been treating your migraine with triptans - which work well in the short term, but worsen the underlying problem. That's why migraine patients on triptans often notice that they got attacks more often and more severely, leading to taking more triptans (implying more and permanent profit for the pharma industry). Don't use them.<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c1878958370581468868 title="comment permalink">2/22/15, 10:01 AM</a><br><br>

And here is where I think you have gone wrong:<br><br>It's not all about entropy. I think there is a blind spot that probably comes from the materialist reductionist worldview. Since it is obvious that there is something causing the increase in order and complexity in the world, what is it? <br>From a philosophical view, I see entropy as a beautiful and natural component of a dual system. It's the sort of thing that cries out for its natural opposite, as this is the way so many things function in our dualistically running universe. <br><br>I had proposed a week or so back that the opposite of entropy is consciousness, with its will, desire, intention. Matter is utterly without will or preference, which is why you can build a universe out of it. All living things possess consciousness, freedom, desire and have a life cycle. <br><br>Your body has its life cycle, and to say what you say about the body of the universe could be compared to saying that since your body has a trajectory that ultimately ends in dissolution, it is the best expression of your body's desire and will to damage your own health as quickly as possible to bring about this natural end even sooner.<br><br>But entropy and heat death are not the desire of the universe, even if it is its fate. Rather, consider that if matter did not exist in its condition of utter willingness (lack of preference) it could not be subject to mechanical laws and be predictable material with which to have a logical world, subject to our scientific investigation. Entropy plays a crucial role, for if there were not energy gradients down which to step (as all organization involves a concentration of energy), then everything would be frozen in place! Entropy seems like a real drag to us, but without it everything would be altered in a useless direction. A kaleidoscope that doesn't move. To have a drama of, according to the Hindus, 23 trillion years duration, (an incarnation of Brahma, i.e., the manifestation and dissolution of a universe) we must have entropy PLUS its opposite, the life force, the organizational force, the mind of God, call it what you will. All entropy does is break things back down into the simplest constituents so that they can be reused. Now, it may very well be that over very long periods of time not everything can be neatly recycled and that ultimately there is more and more unusable stuff. That could be compared to the old age of the body of the universe.<br><br>Do YOU have any purpose whatsoever in the time you have been given, other than to await your death or bring it about more quickly? Why did the universe bother to bring forth life if all it wants is to die? Is there anything else of import going on, other than your death, such as wisdom, compassion, ethics, learning? If so, you might want to lay on those tracks...although I do advise picking your battles carefully.<br><br>And then, too, as an afterthought, isn't it odd that you can even consider such a philosophy of death? It might be a natural outgrowth of our current culture of scientism, material reductionism, and peak meaninglessness.<br><br>Is it monistic or dualistic? It is monistic where it should be dualistic. As an advaitist, I see everything as ultimately nondual, but the first distortion of reality is from the one into two, and duality is the engine of the universe, at least on a material level. <br><br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c5464170780850260239 title="comment permalink">2/22/15, 12:09 PM</a><br><br>

The “newness” in the individual psyche is an endlessly varied recombination of age-old components. Body and soul therefore have an intensely historical character and find no proper place in what is new, in things that have just come into being. That is to say, our ancestral components are only partly at home in such things. We are very far from having finished completely with the Middle Ages, classical antiquity, and primitivity, as our modern psyches pretend. Nevertheless, we have plunged down a cataract of progress, which sweeps us on into the future with ever wilder violence the farther it takes us from our roots. Once the past has been breeched, it is usually annihilated, and there is no stopping the forward motion. But it is precisely the loss of connection with the past, our uprootedness, which has given rise to the “discontents” of civilisation and to such a flurry and haste that we live more in the future and its chimerical promises of a golden age than in the present, with which our whole evolutionary background has not yet caught up. We rush impetuously into novelty, driven by a mounting sense of insufficiency, dissatisfaction, and restlessness. We no longer live on what we have, but on promises, no longer in the light of the present day, but in the darkness of the future, which, we expect, will at last bring the proper sunrise. We refuse to recognise that everything better is purchased at a price of something worse; that, for example, the hope of greater freedom is cancelled out by increased enslavement to the state, not to speak of the terrible perils to which the most brilliant discoveries of science expose us. The less we understand of what our fathers and forefathers sought, the less we understand ourselves, and thus we help with all our might to rob the individual of his roots and his guiding instincts, so that he becomes a particle in the mass, ruled only by what Nietzsche called the spirit of gravity.<br><br>Reforms by advances, that is, by new methods or gadgets, are of course impressive at first, but in the long run they are dubious and in any case dearly paid for. They by no means increase the contentment or happiness of people on the whole. Mostly, they are deceptive sweetenings of existence, like speedier communications, which unpleasantly accelerate the tempo of life and leave us with less time than ever before. Omnis festinatio ex parte diaboli est-all haste is of the devil, as the old masters used to say.<br><br>Reforms by retrogressions, on the other hand, are as a rule less expensive and in addition more lasting, for they return to the simpler, tried and tested ways of the past and make the sparsest use of newspapers, radio, television, and all supposedly timesaving innovations.<br><br>Carl Jung, from Memories, Dreams, Reflections, 1961<br><br>----<br><br>Post Continued...<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c700618631489633084 title="comment permalink">2/22/15, 12:37 PM</a><br><br>

This process took a good 20-30 minutes, not because my notes are a mess, but because I got lost in the delight and memory of the treasure trove of written material that I had mostly forgotten about. Notes from books I've read, notes from workshops and gatherings, old interviews and poems that struck my fancy. <br><br>But it wasn't the written words themselves that I enjoyed the most. Leafing through the physical pages, noticing the stains, the smudges, the crinkles, these imperfections told a story of their own. They took me back to the place and circumstance of their origin. A hand-written interview with Murray Bookchin brought me to my first internship on an organic farm seven years ago. I sat at the enormous wooden dining table on our only day off, copying out these radical ideas that so impressed me at the time. The aroma of tomatoes cooking on the stove wafted into the room, and the soft chatter and laughter of half a dozen resting farmers found its place among the equally sweet chorus of birdsong. <br><br>And so on, page after page.<br><br>So I begin to wonder, these new technologies may give us tremendous speed and power, but what experiences do they rob us of in the process?<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c4413641783409869712 title="comment permalink">2/22/15, 12:38 PM</a><br><br>

Last night I happened to watch a lecture by a German historian who has written a book that supports your argument. It's called Empire of Cotton. <br><br>I'm summarizing my recollection of the historian's summary of his book. His thesis is that demand for production of cotton as an export commodity predates the Industrial Revolution, under what's usually called the mercantile system and he calls Warfare Capitalism. Cotton production was a major driver for the imposition of capitalism on the entire world through a partnership of private enterprise and state sponsored violence. <br><br>My guess from listening to the talk is that the author somewhat underestimates the centrality of fossil fuels in enabling industrial capitalism, but that his analysis of how it works as a coercive social system and what drove the shift from previous economic arrangements is pretty sound. The patterns that were established by cotton production still prevail, minus the large scale use of slave labor.<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c7337143027600613066 title="comment permalink">2/22/15, 2:16 PM</a><br><br>

They had parts, but the stores just treated them like a sideline that they wished would go away.

We always joked that the slogan should have been "Radio Shack; You've got Questions, We've got Blank Stares."<br><br>Even back in the good days, the salespeople were hired for their ability to push people into buying and absolutely no consideration for their knowledge of anything about electronics or even electricity! When I was in high school in the early 1970's I had become good friends with a manager of the only Radio Shack in the city of Tucson that actually made sure his employees knew something other than just sales, his store was always stocked far better than any of the other stores in town. This did cause him problems though, all the other store managers in town knew that if they were out of something (happened a lot), they could just write up the sale, do an ICST (Intra-Company-Stock-Transfer) and send the customer over to my friend's store to pick it up. He didn't even get the credit for the sale, but did have to do the work to re-stock! I actually worked at that store on weekends doing repairs of customer equipment while I was still in High School.<br><br>This was very different from the early days of the 1940's that my dad told me about when Radio Shack was just one store in Boston and had big ads for all sorts of surplus equipment and radio parts in the Ham Radio magazines.<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c3949885135984325320 title="comment permalink">2/22/15, 3:16 PM</a><br><br>

Harris tweed does indeed have flecks. What they do us dye the fibre itself and mix the fibres in different proportions before carding to create different yarns. The underlying structure is typically a twill variant, often a herringbone or regular 2/2 twill. The Harris weavers originally wove on traditional wooden handbooks before being supplied with hattersley domestic looms, which are a compact version of a power loom, but powered by pedals rather than the (then) more common ceiling mounted rotating shaft. The story I heard is that they were originally designed for rural India, to be used by technologically uneducated weaving people who had poor access to the technology of the time (no steam engines, mines, etc) but it turned out that were very suitable for the western Isles too, so that's funny. Sadly, not so many are in use now, but luckily gave been replaced by the griffith loom (erroneously referred to as a bonas griffith. The bonas us actually an electric lifting head for a jacquard loom. The Harris weavers got confused I think because griffith textile machinery used to have bonas in their name as they were a manufacturer of parts for that machine) which is an amazingly simple rapier loom. It was basically made to be fixable by anyone handy enough to mend a bicycle with a roll of gaffa take and a pile of spanners. Wonderful machine. <br><br>Anyhow, I don't know about American sources, but I got my loom training at a company called Holland and Sherry in peebles, they're a fabric merchant who sell a lot of Harris tweed to tailors the world over. They ship any quantity, a great deal of their business cones from single suits and such. It may be an expensive business, but if you have a fabric sample or a good idea of what you want and know a decent tailor or can make it yourself, there's no reason you couldn't get any tweed you want, there are literally thousands of patterns available<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c8715180751450084825 title="comment permalink">2/22/15, 4:32 PM</a><br><br>

Our last place was in the downtown section of a New England coastal town. When we bought it 15 years ago the area was pretty run down, but the good thing was we were able to take the 2 acres of yard and do a lot with it - few neighbors really cared. So we gardened extensively, had chickens and bees and rabbits, put in lots of fruit trees/bushes and at the end we were growing and preserving some crops for sale, mainly medicinal herbs. <br><br>Problem was, the neighborhood gentrified in the last few years, mainly New York money coming in for the walkable downtown location. So it was getting a bit more difficult to keep doing what we did, and we decided to sell up and move into the country a bit more, get a couple more acres, and keep it going. Sad thing is, though, the new buyers, despite saying they loved the gardens and raised beds and greenhouse and stuff, then decided it was too overwhelming for them and asked us take it all away when we moved. So we now have all the infrastructure of a two acre urban homestead sitting in a storage container waiting for us to land somewhere (don't worry, we got new homes for the 18 chickens). I'm just hoping the new owners don't take it all back to turf, which would be a pity. <br><br>So I guess it's the skills (as well as the portable infrastructure) that are really the succession plan. I'm looking forward to getting a new place up and running as soon as we can. <br><br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c3181151533524663705 title="comment permalink">2/22/15, 5:17 PM</a><br><br>

Optimal sodium intake for adults is between 3 and 7 grams a day(3,000 to 7,000 milligrams), even for people with high blood pressure.

I couldn’t access the info when I went to Barron’s site - but I don’t subscribe to it either.<br><br>The author shows that EP has plateaued and is declining. How much of this is due to the work on increasing energy efficiency and/or conservation isn’t clear. <br>The author feels that it show that the economy isn’t growing/progressing, despite the rhetoric that it is. That makes some sense to me.<br><br>Annoyingly, the author also claims the plateau and the chart on summer EP use for air conditioning shows that “global warming” hasn’t occurred. I think that means that he doesn’t understand that climate change means that there may or may not be “global warming”, at least in the short term.<br><br>And there is global warming - ex., here in West Central Maine, ticks carrying Lyme disease are moving progressively north. <br>And robins!

You get tonight's gold star for drawing the necessary conclusions, even when they're unwelcome. <br><br>Sgage, now there's a blast from the past. Many thanks. <br><br>William, one of the reasons I don't use an iPad -- well, other than that I don't need one, don't want one, and have better uses for my money and time -- is that it makes it a lot easier for me to talk to people about walking away from technology. Your earlier comment, btw, was off topic -- if you want to read up on the economic limits to fossil fuel production and how we know those are getting close, there are plenty of other places online to do that. <br><br>Unknown Deborah, I could certainly see having an onboard computer to do that, but a hundred of them? <br><br>Shane, there's a good deal more than that involved. You might want to look up sometime how many commonly prescribed medications have progressive weight gain as a side effect. Hint: antibiotics and most of the popular antidepressants are among them.<br><br>Nils, thanks for this! <br><br>Daelach, as usual, the "simple explanation" drastically oversimplifies the issues involved. Diets normally fail because the human body did not evolve to adjust its metabolism to fashion. When it doesn't get enough food, as a result, the reactions that are triggered are those that used to keep people alive during famines -- and those include turning down the basal metabolic rate and stashing every spare calorie as body fat. That change never completely reverses itself. Repeated dieting thus teaches the body that it has to be ready for famine at any point, and it becomes extremely efficient at storing calories, with obvious results. It's educational, if you ever get a mind to do this, to calculate how many calories a day it would theoretically take to keep a morbidly obese person at their current weight, and then compare that to how much morbidly obese people actually eat (about as much as anyone else -- yes, that's been checked repeatedly in controlled studies). Their metabolisms have become so efficient, typically through repeated diets from childhood on, that they can maintain their weight on a modest fraction of the calorie intake that would theoretically be required. <br><br>Onething, the idea that there's an obesity epidemic, and it's all caused by people's behavior. In point of fact, the average American weighs about 25 lbs more than in 1950; the average American is also an inch and a half taller, which adds to body weight, and if you subtract the effect of the extra height, the additional weight amounts to seven more pounds on average. The horror! As for the reasons why the media might want to convince people that they have to rush out and spend billions of dollars every year on diets (that don't work), medications (that don't work), and a galaxy of other weight loss nostrums (that don't work), why, I'm sure I can't imagine why that would be a, shall we say, profitable gimmick...<br><br>Legalize, there you have it -- another good example of "progress." <br><br>Lewis, thanks for that. Radio Shack hasn't been useful for tinkerers for decades, but it's probably asking too much to expect the media to notice that.<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c7477000096289054737 title="comment permalink">2/22/15, 10:22 PM</a><br><br>

I've just recently reread Jung's <i>Aion</i> -- it was a Valentine's Day present from my wife -- and am yet again impressed by the old sorcerer of Zurich. As for the value of paper notes -- exactly. Writing is more than data; it's also the physical context and substrate of data, and those things also matter. <br><br>Peacegarden, thank you. I didn't know that they'd identified a steroidal basis for the six months of feeling wonderful that any new diet creates -- that's fascinating. I've just noticed over the years, from watching people in a society that's basically psycho about food, that everyone who goes on a new fad diet, no matter what it is, feels wonderful for six months or so...and then the effect goes away. <br><br>August, I know the feeling. I've gotten some wonderful books at library book sales, for pennies on the $20 bill, and am always torn between delight in the new purchase and horror that the library got rid of something that good. <br><br>Bruno, or maybe we're an art project -- Gaia decided that when the current sea beds get raised up into mountains fifty or sixty million years from now, all that plastic will make rocks turn interesting colors. <br><br>Eileen aka Wilton, it impresses me, in a wry sort of way, that so many people are so desperately trying to find reasons to insist that the climate isn't out of whack. Flattening out climate change into "global warming" is a common strategy -- and of course they had plenty of help from careless climate activists there, too. As for the more important point, electric power demand might make a workable proxy for "progress," but of course the first thing to do is figure out what the word "progress" means in the first place. Progress toward what goal? <br><br><br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c4573847051130315356 title="comment permalink">2/22/15, 10:33 PM</a><br><br>

Empires become empires by using their military might to coerce vassal states to produce raw materials cheaply for the central hub of the empire - the 1%. Which enriches that hub enormously - it gets value way beyond 1:1 in these unequal trade exchanges, and the vassal states pay with poverty, pollution and degradation of their environments. But then when fossil fuels are added to that equation, the exchange rate jumps exponentially. Not only do we, as the 1%, profit from unequal trade with the rest of the world, we get the goose that lays the golden eggs and get to profit from millions of years' worth of stored energy as well, whilst carefully controlling those areas of the planet where the fossil fuel is most abundant.<br><br>There is a website somewhere that calculates how many 'slaves' we in the so-called 'developed' world use via our cheap imported products and energy use every day. However, they are invisible slaves, so we think we have actually earned every penny of work we get from our dishwashers and vacuum cleaners, and that $5 t-shirts are our god-given right.<br><br>@Deborah, I am sorry to say that cotton is still produced with forced labour. One of the world's largest cotton producers is Uzbekistan, which uses forced labour and child labour to harvest cotton. The largest importers of Uzbekistan cotton are China and Bangladesh, which of course is where the bulk of our cotton clothes come from. So I imagine that you and I are both wearing t-shirts made with child labour, the cotton for which is sprayed with defoliants which cause birth defects in the children of women working in the cotton fields. <br><br>As you can imagine, I am a very jolly dinner guest.<br><br>I wonder if Capitalism (which is working admirably for the 1%) could indeed continue to thrive without the 99%, and a planet which has so far put up with us plundering her for treasure?<br><br>I find it very difficult to live ethically in our society, and I am only just beginning to discover the worrying way our society ticks. I wonder how far I would need to scale back my life in order not to profit from someone else's misery? That's partly what Walden was doing in his cabin in the woods, but he had to quit after two years and go back to work to pay off his debts..<br><br>I'm sure it's the way madness lies, but Mr Archdruid, you piqued my imagination when you mentioned in a comment some weeks ago about living in the interstices between the monolithic institutions of modern society. I want to find those places between and live there too.. I think that's the only way forward for me as an idealist, because there is nothing in mainstream society that I have found that I can give my allegiance to. But it is a bit worrying. I mean, how far do you go with that project? St Francis started by throwing off all his clothes and running off to live in the woods. <br><br>Ah well, at least it is summer here in the Southern Hemisphere..<br><br> <br><br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c7441605566599054119 title="comment permalink">2/23/15, 4:06 AM</a><br><br>

The same group was advertising on campus-approved message boards with less inflammatory imagery. (Wolves howling at a red moon, if the symbolism means anything to anyone.) <br><br>This may be the first sign that your prediction of marxism returning in force to North American politics is coming true. <br><br>Unlike the first round of marxism on this continent, this one is very explicitly pro-First-Nations and anti-colonialist. Indeed, one of the demands of the group's prominently displayed manifesto (along with eliminating tuition fees, etc.) was requiring an "anti-colonialist aspect" to every program. My wife and I had a good laugh trying to figure out what anti-colonialist physics or mathematics would look like, but that too may be a sign of times to come.

That sparked a discussion which is still on- going.<br>I told them that JMG's blog has been attracting so many comments that I really could not point them to Jonathan's in particular, so I gave them a brief summary of the discussion, including JMG's response.<br>I put the gist of it this way: "'progress,' the shibboleth dividing 'smart' citizens from the 'backward,' could be reasonably defined as 'methods of increasing the externalization of costs.'” <br><br>One replied: "Technology the Servant has made Mankind the Slave. Most of the "Food" we buy in the store is not made to provide Nourishment but the maximum profit. Fruit &amp; Vegetables have been modified to provide maximum durability in shipment &amp; "Shelf Appeal"!Tomato slices firmer than the Meat Patty and just as tasteless as the Lettuce leaf!"<br><br>Another said: "I think there's something to it. Under the current system of predatory capitalism, it's certainly considered good to make someone else pay your costs.<br>For example, if a corporation announces the introduction of robots and attendant job cuts, its stock will typically rise because to the company and its investors this is a form of progress. Meanwhile, the sacked workers become a burden on society until they find new jobs. At this stage of advanced (read "much progress has been made") predatory capitalism, however, many of the sacked workers won't find new jobs, or will find lower-quality jobs which keep them partly dependent on public benefits.<br>A Japanese academic of my acquaintance pointed out to me that in fact this is how the low-wage job system works. Corporations lock in low-wage, no-benefit jobs, forcing their employees to get state subsidies to survive. In this way, businesses can externalize a large portion of their labor costs. All in the name of progress..."<br><br>A professor wrote back at length, saying: "The idea of exactly how progress "externalized costs" wasn't entirely clear to me at first, but after reading ***'s e-mail, I started to get the picture. The introduction of "new and improved" products allows the companies to profit while externalizing all the costs associated with additional resource consumption, having to deal with garbage, pollution, and waste, and also shifting onto society the burdens of taking care of people whose jobs have been replaced. One point to add, though I'm sure everyone's already aware of it, is that "new and improved" products not only enable companies to make cheaper products and sell them at a higher price, but also allow companies to use planned obsolescence as a strategy for selling more products. It's not just disposable pens or products that break soon and have to be replaced, but also entire systems. " He has written back with a long list of examples of such externalities.<br><br>The fourth, Tony Boys, who introduced me to the hard realities of peak oil, wrote: "I read some of the conversation about externalities. If you or the others have not read it yet, you should read "Sacred Economics" by Charles Eisenstein - it's available free on the net. Lots of good insights and thinking there."<br><br>I.e., they all agree wholeheartedly with Jonathan. Now what will be interesting is to take this to people who do not understand peak oil and its related issues and see what they say. I think that many people just have not been able to put a finger on what is going wrong in their lives, but they are depressed.<br><br>Then there are those few who are still benefiting, perhaps deliberately from "progress." The ultimate "smell test" may be how much bluster and name-calling we attract from certain quarters.<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c3308249710991999285 title="comment permalink">2/23/15, 7:17 AM</a><br><br>

They rely on most of their readers just uncritically accepting their claims and failing to actually look at the graph. <br><br>In this case, the claim is made that "ever since the summer of 1995 (when EP’s summer demand peaked at 30% above its 52Wk M/A), peak-electrical demand for EP has been declining".<br><br>But a glance at the charts shows that this is not the case in absolute terms (top chart) where peak demand has handily exceeded '95 levels. Notice that in the statement above, the '95 peak is quoted in "% above moving-average" terms. But the following claim that "peak-electrical demand for EP has been declining" neglects to mention whether it is in "% above moving-average" or absolute terms and it is clear that it is only true in % terms (lower chart). <br><br>If a number is quoted without using the "%" qualifier, readers will (correctly) assume that it should be interpreted as the absolute value, not a percentage. So the phrasing is misleading, whether by accident or accidentally on purpose I leave for you to determine. (Hint: exactly this sort of mislabelling etc happens endlessly in these sorts of articles). <br><br>Also, note that the '95 peak they have chosen as a reference point is an outlier is % terms relative to nearby years. This kind of pathetic cherry-picking is a standard denial tactic. <br><br>2. The source is a gold-bug investment site; generally these folk know even less about science than standard investment folks, which is already not much at all (to be generous).<br><br>3. For a long time, China watchers used electrical demand figures to get around the doctoring of official economic numbers. But then the Chinese wised up and started doctoring the electrical numbers too. <br><br>4. Er, these numbers are for US demand. So how can a conclusion be drawn about "global-anything"?<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c1813546751752335525 title="comment permalink">2/23/15, 1:03 PM</a><br><br>

Scotland did a sensible thing by restricting the name "Harris tweed" to cloth woven by hand in Scotland, so that mass-produced knockoffs cannot benefit from its reputation.<br><br>On further inquiry, I think that the fabric I remember from my girlhood was a Donegal tweed. Ireland has not put any legal protection on the name, which makes it harder to find.<br><br> I have kept my mother's tweed coat from the nineteen-fifties. It is of heavy wool in a herringbone pattern of reddish brown and cream, overlaid with large flecks of green, red and cream. I recall that my circa 1962 skirt was of orange tweed flecked with turquoise and other contrasting colors, in a weave without any obvious directional pattern. I'd be pleased to find a considerable amount of new cloth like that in dark green or chocolate brown, but no luck so far.

Thoreau lived on land from which the original inhabitants had been run off, and so do I. I purchase a few imported luxuries like coffee and chocolate from fair trade sources. I don't buy goods containing palm oil without an idea of where the palm oil is coming from. I could buy more used and local than I do. I could just do with less, as JMG recommends. <br><br>There's also the question of whether the effort expended to avoid taking advantage of other people's misery might be spent instead on political activism to help those people directly. I don't have an answer to that.<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c7321419751572103161 title="comment permalink">2/23/15, 3:49 PM</a><br><br>

I remember several years ago watching a documentary on TV about oil and one of the experts had calculated the amount of work that the human race has been able to glean from all this oil, and the number he gave was the equivalent to the peoples of the earth having 22 billion slaves working around the clock. That is the equivalent of each person on earth having at least three slaves, but we know that most of the people wouldn't have any. I know it is almost unthinkable, but have you given much thought to the impulse to actually physically and legally re-enslave billions to keep the millions in the style to which they have become accustomed? <br>Early in the first term of the current Alabama governor this state did everything it could to banish the largely Mexican migrant farm workers who harvested the produce. On a political photo op to a tomato farm in south Alabama things went a little wrong for the governor when the farmer asked him if he liked tomatoes. Of course the governor said that he did and with that the farmer handed him a five gallon bucket and told him to help himself.<br>Of course the governor declined the offer but the importance of the incident was lost on no one. Why aren't things like that telegraphed around the world by the liberal media?<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c5888833120224130523 title="comment permalink">2/23/15, 5:39 PM</a><br><br>

I gain so much motivation and extraordinary information from this fascinating community space.

But a)I am not a political activist, mainly because I would rather gnaw off my right arm than go to a meeting, and b)I really don't believe that what I say should be different to what I do.<br>LESS is important, not only because it is expedient for those of us who think that it is the best way to meet the future - the beauty of it is that what is good for the planet is also good in a social justice sense and ALSO seems to point the way to a more satisfying, truly human life.<br>I am such a rank beginner at steering this course though. My useful skills are mostly non-existent; I am your average suburbanite, green-lite, optimistically hoping that the world will magically remake itself without me having to do anything drastic, and then that pesky Archdruid kept responding to my comments with the question, 'And what are YOU going to do about that?'

It's a common delusion of elite groups to forget that their entire existence depends on the society they run, but whenever that delusion is put to the test, reality intervenes in short order. <br><br>As for living in the interstices of the system, that's a complicated issue, and depends a great deal on local conditions and personal needs and talents, so I'm not at all sure how much help I can offer you. <br><br>John, yes, they're lashing out. They're terrified. McDonalds is losing market share steadily in the younger consumer demographics, and AB InBev fears nothing more than the proliferation of independent craft breweries and home brewers. In both cases, the marketing model of offering a cheap tasteless product to the mass market and using saturation advertising to convince people to buy it anyway is faltering, and they have no idea how to do anything else. <br><br>Tyler, thanks for the heads up! Yes, this is about what I was expecting. <br><br>RPC, I didn't -- funny. Many thanks. <br><br>FiftyNiner, it's not unthinkable at all -- slavery is still very much with us today, even though it's de facto illegal. Thing is, slavery on a large scale only makes economic sense when you have labor shortages, in specific industries or in general. If you have more people than jobs, it's more economical simply to hire "wage slaves" and spare yourself the cost of feeding, housing, and guarding them. In the sort of future we can expect, where economic contraction leaves billions of desperate people out of work who will do anything for enough food to postpone starvation for another day, slavery's hopelessly inefficient; put up a sign saying WORKERS WANTED: WILL FEED and you'll have more labor than you can use. <br><br>Jean-Vivien, it's part of the latest round of "chicken" between the two parties here in the US.

It is difficult for scientists to communicate with scientists outside their discipline. This creates tunnel vision and makes it very difficult to see the big picture! <br><br>And then there is the pressure to publish. Twenty years ago as a graduate researcher in science I found professors writing abstracts for research not yet done because the deadline for papers to be published required it. I always thought that would make objectivity a problem! <br><br>PhD is short for Doctorate of Philosophy, yet few scientists ever study philosophy or any of the “soft” sciences. When we study the history of science we trace our roots back to naturalists and medical doctors. Such people were often keen observers. Thus, the scientific method begins with observation and deep thinking, eventually to be followed with experiments to prove ones hypothesis.<br><br> Natural philosophy is about looking at the world objectively, thinking deeply about what you see, and eventually arriving at some state of knowledge of how the world works. After many years of careful observation if one is fortunate she may arrive at wisdom. Many naturalists were not only knowledgeable about their favored subjects they were also very accomplished artists because they had spent so much time looking at them they wanted to reproduce them with art.<br><br>I’m glad I had the opportunity to go to college and to study science, because having a background in science has made lifelong learning so much more adventurous! It also makes me a good citizen because I know I can think for myself about the problems we face!<br><br>Cheers,<br>Jody<br><br><a href=what-progress-means.html#c4230209967137057909 title="comment permalink">3/19/15, 9:59 AM</a><br><br>
