Since the Green Wizards project got under way two months ago, I’ve wondered off and on whether it would field any sort of response from the Transition movement. Thus it was not exactly a huge surprise to read <a href=http://transitionculture.org/2010/08/31/why-green-wizards-get-us-nowhere-new/ >Rob Hopkins’ blog post on the subject</a> yesterday. I admit that the tone of his response took me aback, and so did the number of misrepresentations that found their way into it; I have no objection to criticism – quite the contrary, an idea that can’t stand up to honest criticism isn’t worth having in the first place – but it might have been helpful if Hopkins had taken the time to be sure the ideas he was criticizing were ones I’ve actually proposed.<br><br>When I sat down to start this week’s post this morning, I considered going through his comments one by one and correcting the misrepresentations, but what would be the point? Those who are minded to take his statements at face value will doubtless do so anyway; those who are interested in checking the facts can find my views detailed at quite some length in the series of posts beginning June 30 of this year. Instead, I think it’s more useful just now to talk about the things Hopkins’ critique got right. Rob Hopkins is a smart guy, and even though he’s garbled a fair number of the details, his post raises useful points regarding some of the core issues I’ve tried to bring up in the Green Wizards posts.<br><br>The first of those is that one of the motivations behind the Green Wizards project is a recognition of the limitations of the Transition Towns project. I’ve discussed my concerns about that movement on several occasions on this blog, and don’t see any need to repeat those comments just now. The crucial point, though, is one that Hopkins himself cheerfully admits: that neither he nor anyone else in the movement can be sure that it will accomplish what it’s trying to accomplish.<br><br>That’s a bold statement, and one that’s worthy of respect. Still, it has implications I’m not sure Hopkins has followed as far as they deserve. If the difficult future ahead of us can’t be known well enough to tell in advance what strategies will best deal with it, in particular, it seems to me that it’s a serious mistake to put all our eggs in one basket, whether it’s the one labeled "Transition" or any other.<br><br>This is the underlying strategy that guides the Green Wizards project. I’ve argued here that the best approach to an unpredictable future is dissensus: that is, the deliberate avoidance of consensus and the encouragement of divergent approaches to the problems we face. The Green Wizards project is one such divergent approach. It tries to address a broad range of possible futures with a flexible set of tools, but there are no guarantees; it’s entirely possible that the project will fail, or that the future will turn out to be so different from my expectations that it could never have succeeded at all.<br><br>That last comment could be said just as accurately of the Transition approach, and of course that’s exactly the point. Neither project offers an answer to all the challenges the future might dump on us, and neither one is guaranteed to work. This is why I’ve tried to craft the Green Wizards project to fill in some of the gaps the Transition Town movement fails to address. Does that make the two projects mutually exclusive? Not at all; it could as easily be argued that they’re complementary – though it also needs to be remembered that the two projects taken together don’t cover all the possibilities, either. Other projects will be needed to do that, and if we’re lucky, we’ll get them.<br><br>This leads to the second point that Rob Hopkins got absolutely right, which is that the Green Wizard project isn’t a solution to every problem the future has in store for us. I’m not at all sure where Hopkins got the idea that the project is predicated on an imminent fast collapse, which is very nearly the opposite of my views – the most popular of my peak oil books so far isn’t titled <a href=http://www.newsociety.com/bookid/4014>The Short Descent</a>, you know – but he’s quite right to say that I consider peak oil, and more generally the impact of fossil fuel and resource depletion on an economy and society that depends on limitless growth, to be the core driving force of the next century or so of social crisis and disintegration. (The main impacts of anthropogenic climate change, according to most climatologists, will come further down the line.) That’s what the Green Wizard project is intended to address, and criticizing it for not trying to do what it’s not intended to do is a bit like criticizing a hammer because it’s not a very good saw.<br><br>The Seventies-era appropriate technology that’s at the core of the project, for that matter, is only one of many options that could be used within the strategy I’m proposing. I chose that option partly because it’s something I happen to know well, having worked with it for thirty years now; partly because it evolved to deal with the consequences of energy shortages in a time of economic turmoil, and that promises to be a fair description of the decades just ahead of us; and partly because I’ve discovered that a great deal of what was learned back in the days of the appropriate tech movement never got handed down to the people in today’s peak oil scene.<br><br>I’ve also found that a great many people who are worried about peak oil take to the old appropriate tech material like a duck to water, once they learn about it, and are refreshingly likely to do something practical with it. One of the challenges most of us who speak publicly about peak oil face all the time is the honest question, "Yes, but what can I do about it?" Hopkins has offered his answer to that question, and it’s an answer that’s clearly satisfactory to many people, but it’s not suited to everybody.<br><br>The birth of the Green Wizard project itself came about as a result of that last fact. The project started with <a href=../../2010/06/merlins-time.html>a post here</a> that tentatively suggested the archetype of the wizard, and the toolkit of the old appropriate tech movement, as the starting points for an option worth exploring as we move deeper into the Age of Limits. That post fielded more comments and email than any other Archdruid Report post has ever gotten, and a very large number of the responses amounted to "This is what I’ve been looking for." Many of the people who responded in that way have gone on to begin saving energy, planting gardens, and doing other admirably practical steps. Should I have closed that door in their faces, and insisted that they had to embrace the Transition agenda or do nothing at all? I trust not.<br><br>This leads in turn to the third point that Rob Hopkins got unquestionably right, which is that the Green Wizard project is not aimed at building resilient communities. That’s the core of the Transition Towns strategy, if I understand Hopkins’ writings correctly, and the Transition Towns program is certainly one way to go about trying to do that – though it’s not the only way, and not necessarily the best way in every case. What I’m not sure Hopkins has grasped is his strategy isn’t the only game in town.<br><br>To begin with, as I’ve just mentioned, there are plenty of people who are interested in doing something about the challenges of the future, but for whom the Transition program is not a viable option. There are people, quite a few of them, who live in communities full of rock-ribbed conservatives who believe that global warming is a hoax manufactured by the Democratic Party and that we’d have all the oil we need if the government allowed unrestricted drilling, and as many who live in communities full of liberals who believe just as firmly that their SUV lifestyles can run just as well on wind farms or algal biodiesel as on fossil fuels. There are people who, for one reason or another, are not suited to the work of community organizing, and others who have been there, done that, and would sooner gnaw a rat’s pancreas than sit through another round of long meetings in order to produce another round of elaborate plans that everyone involved knows will never be anything more than ink on paper. Insisting that such people ought to follow the Transition program anyway is not going to have any useful result.<br><br>Yet there’s another issue I don’t think Hopkins has addressed, and it comes right back to his cheerful admission that there’s no guarantee the Transition program can do what it’s supposed to do. The Transition program assumes that the best way to deal with the impending crises of the future is to organize for resilience on a community level, and it also assumes that the best way to do this is to produce a discreetly managed consensus within individual communities, turn that consensus into a plan, and then act on the plan. Neither of those assumptions is a certainty, and there are reasons – some of which I’ve discussed in this blog – why strategies based on them may be doomed to fail.<br><br>This point deserves making in the clearest possible terms. It’s pure speculation, however appealing the speculation might be, that communities are the best option, or even a workable option, for building the sort of resilience Hopkins has in mind. Even if he’s right, it may no longer be possible to build communities that are resilient in any meaningful sense, in the face of the troubles bearing down on us at this point. Even if it is still possible to do so, the methods the Transition movement proposes may not be a viable way of doing it. Based on his public writings, I believe Hopkins would agree with these statements. That being the case, though, we’re back to the point I made earlier: in the face of an unpredictable future, it’s wise to explore more than one possible response.<br><br>The Green Wizards project is an attempt to create one of these alternative responses. As I’ve already suggested, it’s partly inspired by an attempt to fill in some of the gaps left open by the Transition program, and so it should come as no surprise that it differs from the Transition program in a great many respects. It doesn’t claim to be a solution to every problem the future might throw our way, and so it’s pretty much guaranteed that there will be things the Transition program covers that the Green Wizard project does not, and vice versa. It doesn’t focus on the creation of resilient communities, but instead of criticizing it for that reason, Hopkins could as well have said that Transition already has that covered, and alternative projects could use their time more wisely by tackling other issues Transition is not well positioned to address – which, again, is what the Green Wizard project is trying to do.<br><br>That this wasn’t his response troubles me. That’s not because I think Hopkins ought to accept all the presuppositions behind the Green Wizards project – if he did that, presumably he’d have launched some project like it, instead of the one he did in fact launch – or because I think the Green Wizards project shouldn’t be criticized. As I mentioned toward the beginning of this essay, any idea worth having is worth critiquing, and the skill of learning even from harsh criticism is essential to projects of the kind Hopkins and I are pursuing, each in his own way. Equally, when criticism misses or misunderstands its target, it can be useful to point out where this has happened, and try to clarify the issues under debate. Still, there’s a line of some importance between such responses and the kind of defensive stance that treats any critique as an assault to be repelled, and any alternative project as a potential rival to be quashed.<br><br>I don’t think that Hopkins and the Transition movement have crossed that line yet, and I trust they will recognize the risks and stay well back from it. Still, it worries me that recent responses on the part of Hopkins and other people in the Transition movement to criticism have begun to display traces of the defensiveness and the spirit of rivalry to be found beyond that line. I’m thinking particularly of the responses fielded by Alex Steffens’ critique of the Transition movement on his <a href=http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/010672.html>Worldchanging</a> blog. I’m by no means a fan of Steffens, but he raised points that deserve more attention, and a more substantive and less dismissive <a href=http://transitionculture.org/2009/11/03/responding-to-alex-steffens-critique-of-transition-at-worldchanging/ >response</a>, than I feel they received.<br><br>Ultimately, though, the way people in the Transition movement choose to respond to its critics is their choice, not mine. Meanwhile, the Green Wizard project is moving ahead. I’m pleased to announce that after many requests from participants in the project, an online forum for aspiring green wizards is live at <a href=http://www.greenwizards.org/ >http://www.greenwizards.org</a>; a tip of the wizard’s hat to Teresa Hardy and Cathy McGuire for the hard work that made this happen.<br><br>I’m by no means sure what the next steps forward will be. This project is barely two months old, and has already expanded and developed in ways that I never anticipated; for the foreseeable future, at least, improvisation is the order of the day. Still, aspiring green wizards and more casual readers alike can expect another exploration of the practical options ahead of us in next week’s <i>Archdruid Report</i> post.

Really, I'd rather just feed my chickens, or putter in my garden and try out new pickle recipes (beans and carrots with garlic, and zucchini with peppers were attempted this week) then tell my friends and neighbours about the stuff I'm doing along with the repeated refrain of "hey, why don't you try it? I'll help if you want."<br><br>I'm just more Wizardly than Transitional, I guess. Thank goodness there's room for all of us.

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c2474134991692473305></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/18378344866487206569 rel=nofollow>Brad K.</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>JMG,<br><br>Rob's position seems to me - though he doesn't state it - that he worries about distractions, energy lost following leads that aren't driving and supporting the Transition efforts.<br><br>As well, Rob is likely correct, that Green Wizards won't accomplish the goals set for Transition.<br><br>I did notice one particular statement of Rob's that felt . . funny. He stated that <em>"I can’t help thinking that the idea that we will see the rapid onset of peak oil and economic collapse, at which point society starts to unravel, and desperately and reverently turns to a few enlightened souls who are fortunately bravely clutching a load of tatty books from the 1970s, and who are then able, from those curled and well thumbed xeroxed pages, to rebuild the world anew, is somewhat naive."</em><br><br>First, I never understood that Green Wizardry was intended to rebuild today's world. Next, I got the impression that in the coming Age of Limits, fragmentation of society and social structure will be more likely than a single, unified social structure ready to recognize and turn to the One True Light to save everyone. It was my impression that we can expect lots of will-he, nil-he unfocused striving to retain, restore, or hijack social power. That would make finding a single solution and applying it usefully, across the nations (or tribes or bands or villages or whatever) would be astonishingly remote.<br><br>Where Transition Towns prepare to preserve community structure, autonomy, and governmental functions, I see Green Wizards as helpful neighbors, community "asset" people but on an informal basis. There will likely be a need to focus on character and ethics to assure Green Wizards are due the respect they will need to be accepted and allowed to contribute.<br><br>So there you have it, my assessment of Rob's concerns. That is, that Green Wizardry isn't likely to save the social and governmental structure of communities and regions the way Transition Towns intend. And that diverting energy and attention and other resources from Transition Towns is bad.<br><br><a href=since-green-wizards-project-got-under.html#c2474134991692473305 title="comment permalink">9/1/10, 8:41 PM</a><br><br>

I'd say that anything worth doing, on the large scale of things, won't be completed in the time of a single generation.

I'm pretty sure most climatologists wouldn't be that specific. Some think it's quite possible that tipping points may be reached which hasten climate change but, in any case, climate change is already having an impact as extreme weather events are becoming more extreme, if not more frequent. Individual weather events can never be traced to a cause of AGW but forecasts are for increasing extremes and, in some cases, increasing incidence of extremes. Food prices seem to be heading up, following the drought in Russia. Whether that is down to climate change is unknowable but the impacts of climate change can't really be dismissed so easily.<br><br>Fortunately, I think individual (or family) self sufficiency is one way of mitigating the impacts of climate change, at least in some areas.<br><br>Tony<br><br><a href=since-green-wizards-project-got-under.html#c5205874574622252765 title="comment permalink">9/1/10, 9:58 PM</a><br><br>

I had read Rob Hopkin's original comments and was wondering whether you'd devote this weeks post to it. I'm glad you did. Your ecosystem analogy that you use in the Ecotechnic Future is apt here - keeping all possible options open for as long as possible is by far the sanest and most sensible strategy. <br><br>I am a planner by profession (whatever that means), and I really don't think that traditional planning can even begin to deal with the problems that we face. It requires too much authority to being with, authority that will become increasingly disrespected in the years to come.

I am also on the periphery of the transition movement here in Sheffield. I've delivered newsletters, I take part in the local carbon reduction commitment monitoring through transition and I have attended a number of meetings but, at the moment for me, transition is looking at too big a community. I'm also on the email list for our local neighbourhood group which is full of dedicated people towards the older and more conservative end of my neighbourhood and I respond and feed in about transport &amp; other bigger issues here. My 'real' community work, such as it is, is based around the street party movement, the Big Lunch, promoted by the Eden Project; http://www.thebiglunch.com/. This has been a way to meet and connect with my immediate neighbours and has worked for me. I can pass on gardening tips and demonstrate resilient behaviour without preaching here. I think my biggest problem is, as someone who was raised in the Methodist church in moving away from this I have lost the little evangelical fervour I had. That said, the churches in my area, though not in any way overtly transition, provide some of the stability, community &amp; resilience needed. Transition is one very useful, high profile movement and I value what it has done in moving the (last) British government to look more seriously at transitioning to a low carbon economy. Good for them!

Constructive criticism is an excellent way to grow. As a society we've moved away from this as people seek not to harm other people's self esteem.

I've been involved in committees over the past year without a great deal of experience in the past in this form of communication. At present, I have basically cut ties with them.

I'm not sure that this is at the top of their thinking, but it is an instinctive reaction among humans in these times.<br><br>In terms of our history, humans have been decentralised for far longer than we have been centralised.

In most of the UK, with its thousands of villages and its historical emphasis on inculcating its citizens with the uniting greatness of the British Empire, the numbers of folk who experience extreme isolation, either physical or psychological, are very small. U.S. geography, however, still allows for extreme isolation, and our nation's emphasis on "self-made" lives has produced countless strains of rugged individualism. If an American citizen doesn't agree with the folks around them, we have long had the option of hitchin' up and movin' out. The crowded landscape of the UK may not prevent a similar impulse, but it does certainly place strict limits on one's ability to carry it out. Just look what they've done to curtail/destroy the lives of the Travellers, a.k.a. Tinkers.<br><br>I'm in rural Maine. I've attended a few Transition Town meetings, but I have to expend a fair amount of fossil fuel to get to the larger population centers where these groups meet. "Transition Towns" are only helpful if there's already a "Town" there in which to make the Transition! Sometimes their programs are genuinely helpful--like the Eric Toensmeier's recent inspiring talk about cold-hardy perennial vegetables. But just as often the topics don't speak to the needs of us homesteader-types out in the sticks. My options for "consensus-building" typically involve my attempts to humbly listen to, and engage more respectfully with, the other (nonhuman) members of my microclimate and bioregion. <br><br>That's why we need the resources--and now, the network--of Green Wizardry, which offers us stuff to DO with--or learn from--those sticks amongst which we live, and ways to share knowledge and wisdom with other people who struggle to balance their sense of isolation with their desire to actively engage with the unfolding future.<br><br><a href=since-green-wizards-project-got-under.html#c6573833181286671115 title="comment permalink">9/2/10, 4:23 AM</a><br><br>

I read Rob Hopkins piece the other day and wondered how you would respond. I live in one of those liberal, affluent towns in the North East. Big houses, big Volvos, lots of travel, lots of stuff. Although the town is only a couple of generations away from a less energy intensive, more resilient way of living, its current occupants are not going to go quietly to the compost heap, believe me. If I was good at community organizing, which I’m not, I could probably get twenty of us into a church hall to brainstorm a community plan and listen to a talk on fruit tree grafting. And at some point in the future, when the moment is ripe in wherever I’m living, I may do so. But right now I’d rather spend my time gardening, insulating my home, installing a stove and building a solar shower. I’m still learning, and don’t want to push rocks up hills. And I also believe that community can flow from all of these individual acts, in some way. We didn’t have a top-down plan to build out the Internet, for example, and that seems to have worked out OK.<br><br><a href=since-green-wizards-project-got-under.html#c5175602966338572937 title="comment permalink">9/2/10, 5:44 AM</a><br><br>

Perhaps he is confusing it with American Survivalism? If so, he should stop and think about that for a moment.

I don't know if this is true, but perhaps Hopkins doesn't understand that Americans (as Greer has noted elsewhere) don't have local cultures or even a national culture anymore.

In others, not so practical. For instance, Rob can envision said communities that work together in his transition town method. In theory I could believe it; in practice, I would say that a community with over 1000+ people is going to have a hard go of it, due to the social fractures and fissures that are just so common amongst our species. For communities of a smaller size, this may be a workable method.

Idling has genuine rewards too, although that would take up a whole post for another time.

One of my quibbles about any project that focuses on making grand plans is that anybody can make a plan; given a week or so, I could come up with a really exciting, hopeful, forward-looking plan for transforming America into a green democracy poised to lead the way into the ecotechnic future, complete with color brochures. At the end of the day, what would that have done? Nothing. It's when you get down to actually making something happen out there in the real world that you get into what matters. <br><br>Ranger, I think more than anything else, green wizards need to lead the way by example. It's not a matter of lurking in the shadows until everybody else realizes you're right, as Hopkins insisted; it's about living a life that works in the midst of a dying system, so that other people can see that there are other options, and choose to follow those if that appeals to them. <br><br>Pops, good. "Make a plan and work it" is sage advice. I'm also reminded of Ernest Thompson Seton's rules for woodcraft: "Where you are, with what you have, right now." <br><br>MaineCelt, you know, the idea of building consensus with the nonhuman environment may be the best use of consensus I've yet encountered. <br><br>James, it would be an interesting conversation, that's for sure. <br><br>Jason, I don't think Steffen should be ignored, either. I think he's dead wrong, but he also has something to offer the conversation, and his comments raised a couple of points I think deserve to be faced in the peak oil scene generally. <br><br>Don, I think you're quite correct. The current surge in right-wing populism -- it's inaccurate to call it "conservatism," as it's not trying to conserve anything that actually exists -- is well on its way to morphing into a revitalization movement of the classic type; the question is simply what they decide they have to do to achieve the state of purity that revitalization movements always think will bring Utopia down from heaven. <br><br>Robin, well, that may be so, but making it happen is quite another matter, and keeping it in place for more than about six weeks is something else again. <br><br>Yupped, that's an intriguing metaphor -- though of course there was one heck of a lot of money available for building the internet, and that's not likely to be the case for green wizards!<br><br>Grrl, the problem with small-scale and piecemeal is that people don't often get excited about it, and people like to be excited. I think that may be one of the things the Green Wizard project has in its favor: being a wizard is exciting enough that it makes up for the unromantic moments of digging garden beds and messing with recalcitrant caulk guns. <br><br>Darius, by all means check it out.

Firstly I think that to take a non-confrontational approach was entirely correct. Secondly I am SO glad to see a focus on the attitude of the TT leader. I hope many will continue to keep an eye on this. The use of the children's toy picture was very typical and revealing. <br>Being English, I'm always interested in the comparison of UK and US cultures. I think that both can be good at collective projects but go about them in different ways (we fund them by taxes for instance!). I think the Americans often can't grasp the historical continuity here. This evening, for instance, if I go out for a drink it will be to a village pub built in the 13th century of cob (mud) with a thatched roof (straw).Nothing particularly unusual about that in Devon - but fairly uncommon in the US? The English village, up to <br>100 years ago, used to be a wonderful model of a self-sufficient community with all its own craftsmen using local materials and a market town within 15 miles. So for me this idea is both a vision of the future and a <br>very real reflection of the past. I think that any TT type movement in England will be affected by this past.<br>As ever I seek guidance from Monty Python - "JMG - you are NOT the Messiah! RH - you are NOT the <br>Messiah!

Last February there was a memoir of the Civil Rights years, quoted in the newspaper, that described the infighting in Martin Luther King's organization, mainly because each arm of the group was trying to do a big job with scarce resources and therefore tended to regard all the others as competitors for those resources. Maybe in sixty years you and Mr. Hoskins will be regarded similarly, as a band of saintly heroes who always acted and spoke harmoniously, and only those of us who were there will remember what a messy, contentious beginning this movement had.<br><br><a href=since-green-wizards-project-got-under.html#c3733896135799322322 title="comment permalink">9/2/10, 12:50 PM</a><br><br>

It is sad, however, when others do see it that way, as one or other, and don't believe all solutions are needed.<br><br>Over on the Yahoo Group RunningOnEmpty2, there has been a discussion going on for about two weeks now under the general subject line of "Sustainable Society" that lately has been essentially a discussion of individual versus community solutions. Unfortunately the main discussants have become polarized, with apparent no hint of either side wavering on their stance. There are those who only want to care about themselves or their immediate family, and there are those who only want or believe in a community-based shared option. No doubt the discussion will continue, but it won't change any of the parties who are speaking out, although it might convince someone new to the topic or sitting on a fence to lean one way or another.<br><br>I don't know enough about the Transition Town/community approach to criticize it other than it seems to lack action. I am normally sympathetic to community-based or collective decisions and implications, but I also see all the energy of the 12 steps being taken up with identifying partnerships and options. The 13th step is action or implementation, but I don't see how the TT movement makes that happen in the end. And I worry about the time involved. Transition's 12 Steps may generate the collective plan, but will the process of getting there also make people want to implement that plan? I have my doubts.<br><br>I see the Green Wizard as not an individual's solution to survival (although it might be), but the training for people to be that resource person within the community to make things happen, or at minimum offer ideas and help. Kind of like a resource librarian who is ready to offer help. Or training people for their particular role in that community of people adapting to the changes. Or the person that shows through example. <br><br>Both/and, not either/or.<br><br><a href=since-green-wizards-project-got-under.html#c5036336361701679564 title="comment permalink">9/2/10, 1:55 PM</a><br><br>

Tolstoy said a lot of smart things, but that wasn't one of them. The idea that we should all be doing things "the best way" is a hard idea for people to shake. I think it is perhaps the most difficult thing to teach people about sustainability: the absolute necessity of diversity - including a whole lot of "inefficient", "sub-optimal", and even "mal-adaptive" forms. After all, when conditions change (and they always do) it is usually out of that reservoir that adaptation happens. Humans may think they've transcended the normal patterns of evolution, and that we can plan and just re-invent ourselves out of any cul de sac, and I'm afraid that could be a fatal misapprehension.<br><br><a href=since-green-wizards-project-got-under.html#c8073355551148632862 title="comment permalink">9/2/10, 3:50 PM</a><br><br>

I live in Kansas, and usually what happens is that things get atomized, organizations blow apart, people get sick of going to three-hour-long meetings which accomplish nothing. <br><br>Organizations tend to be the outgrowth of the leader's ego; followers are solicited at first, but then comes time to do the real work, and the leader ends up doing it all alone, and the organization dissolves soon after. <br><br>Cities here tend to be tremendously unresponsive to this sort of thing, too, they'll form advisory committees who spend years working out elaborate policies and plans of action which are routinely discarded. One medium-sized city's Bicycle Advisory Board managed, after four years of hard effort, to get a bicycle lane designated along four blocks of a city street, next to a line of parking spaces. The Transition Movement is really premature for Kansas, we'll have to wait for a real crisis, gas prices going over $6 per gallon, truckers going out of business, and local stores not getting restocked, for anything to happen on a community basis.<br><br>One of the things we've seen with the Transition Movement in the US is its commercialization, offering "Transition Trainings", with certified "Transition Trainers" for $200 per person for two six-hour days (some more $$, some less). Right now, and for the foreseeable future, we're in a recession, and the people selling these courses and suchlike may see the Green Wizard bit as competition for market share, and are reacting in that manner. At this point I've got strong doubts about both the New-Age-y commercialization of Transition, and its applicability and timeliness here in the US.<br><br><a href=since-green-wizards-project-got-under.html#c4065385747654410107 title="comment permalink">9/2/10, 5:05 PM</a><br><br>

I haven't read the Hackleman book -- be sure to post a review of it on the forum when you get a chance.

As an individual involved in permaculture design, I've seen TT pushed in an almost proselytizing manner by many folks who frequent the same scene. After reading Rob's book, I've formulated the following opinions (not "conclusions" as it were, my models are always subject to future revision):<br><br>TT is great - as ONE possible method of building more sustainable communities.Doubtless, there are many other ways to do similar things - or completely different things. There are some good ideas there, but they are by no means applicable to every community, to every situation, or to all individuals. Personally, I find that the TT movement does not speak to me as an individual nor fit the reality of the community in which I currently reside. This does not mean that TT should be dismissed out of hand - rather that it should be considered by individuals and communities as one possible path out of many.<br><br>One of the earlier commenters said something about not being a "joiner." - I can sympathize with that completely. For that reason, I'm skeptical about aligning myself with a "movement" (TM) - and communities should be as well. While TT may offer some good suggestions, I do not believe it should be considered the be-all and end-all of sustainable community development, as many folks seem to think that it is. I think individuals and communities should figure out for themselves the particular strategies they want to take.<br><br>This is why, while I also think it has left out some important things, I like the Green Wizard approach - while it offers some guidelines, it seems much more decentralized and individualistic in its approach. I appreciate the ideas you've shared with us, and am eager to hear more.

Any <i>a priori</i> devised scheme would certainly not be complete. Knowledge of previous movements is already serving JMG well. More of that kind of knowledge is needed, not less.<br><br>Evolution seldom offers all encompassing and ever sound solutions. But anything available is employed for even temporarily survival or adaptation. A collapse will pressure for many temporary adaptations (and temporarily does not necessarily mean self-destructive), thus even flawed practices could be helpful enough at some times. Both town or community structures and <i>expert</i> wizards are needed as adaptation resources. <br><br>So most ideas are worth both criticizing and supporting. Instead of guessing what will work or not, many things should be rather tried out. The obsessions like “it will not solve all problems”, “mine idea is better” will be a misplaced item in any long or short descent.

Special thanks to JMG for saying a year or so ago that what we need is a radical relocalization. I agreed and renamed my fledgling site on building local community to radicalrelocalization.com. It has some legs and thanks for the inspiration. <br><br>Much of my local focus has centred around face-to-face meetings: a same-tie-each-month local meeting to allow exploration of possibilities, a weekly "skills exchange" column for six months or so, that worked around mini-workshop sharings. The good news here was that the web of connections meant that many more interconnections happened with a steep increase in social glue: visiting gardens, canning together, exploring ideas that can support more "relocalistas" in our community. New and deeper friendships. <br><br>And when I became separated I was able to stay in the community thanks to the "social glue" and found an awesome property to do my green wizarding. I'm off grid and learning.<br><br>I'm also a active Transition Town member in a part of Ottawa where I used to live and still do some cash work. My main observation is that, here anyway, the real costs of building the new are soft-pedalled out, and few folks are actually making personal change on the ground.

To me JMG's approach has felt more aligned with things like the extension service, master gardeners, etc. -- people who accumulate knowledge, skills, and resources so that these things will be extant and available in their communities whether someone wants them tomorrow or in a hundred years. How this is supposedly at odds with The Transition Movement (tm) is hard for me to see. I suspect the people who might chose not to go to the Transition (tm) meetings and instead opt pursue something like what JMG suggests are not likely to go to the Transition (tm) meetings anyway, no matter what. <br><br>Since it has been brought up, I have to say again that the money side of all this is indeed bothersome. Our local Transition (tm) group has been melded with the Financial Permaculture (tm) movement. One of the tag lines I have recently found from the Financial Permaculture (tm) people is "Profits for a prosperous planet!" That just scares me. We know all too well what effects the profit motive tend to have on organized activities; improved environmental and sociological health are not generally on that list. Charging money to train people so they can then charge money to train other people is a scheme with a name that brings up associations with Egypt (no, not that big river). <br><br>By the way, JMG won't get the sarcastic (tm) tag added to the end of "Green Wizarding" unless he starts charging substantial sums for training classes that offer "official" certifications. Book sales and speaking fees are a different thing, that's just ordinary compensation for services rendered, nothing pyramidal about it.<br><br><a href=since-green-wizards-project-got-under.html#c6428364411079127990 title="comment permalink">9/3/10, 6:12 AM</a><br><br>

As far as the Green Wizards program, though, of course it leaves things out -- it's not intended as a solution to everything. Just as one tool isn't going to be a good hammer and a good saw at the same time, one strategy won't answer all needs. <br><br>Das Monde, you get today's gold star; very well put. While the evolutionary dimension wasn't in the forefront of my mind in this post, it undergirds pretty much everything I'm trying to do. Maximum diversity in the early stages of a selection process is how nature does things -- see the Burgess shale for examples -- and it's a good model to follow. <br><br>Andrew, thank you! Those sound like very useful models to follow. As for the costs of building out a new future, yes, I've seen that too, almost everywhere. Very few people want to deal with just how difficult this transition is going to be. <br><br>Bill, thanks for this. As for the possibility of the Green Wizards project being turned into a moneymaking scam, I'd say this: the only person who can make you a green wizard is yourself, and the only way you can do it is to get out there, learn green wizardry, and put it into practice. I can promise you that neither Merlin nor Gandalf had a certificate from some institute or weekend workshop!<br><br>As far as I am concerned, the only costs anyone should have to pay to become a green wizard are those involved in buying books, tools, and raw materials, and maybe for taking classes from somebody who can teach hands-on practical skills. Oh, and if somebody wants to buy me a beer and listen to me blather, that's certainly welcome!<br><br>I'm aware that there will doubtless be people who are already thinking about how to cash in on this project. If any of those people are reading this, let them be warned: the Druid tradition has an ultimate, awful weapon for use in such cases: <br><br>Satire. <br><br>By the time I get through with them, little children will point at them on the street and giggle, and their parents will be dusting off all those old Dan Quayle jokes to put a new name on them.

And in fact I was wrong - I did learn something, or at least have something reinforced: complex social interactions and obligations can get in the way of accomplishing things. Such complex interactions are why I don't believe our society will produce much in the way of a useful response to the predicaments we face, even though there are a great many things that technically could be done. Which is also an illustration of why things like TT don't remotely interest me, and why the ideas John has promoted do. There is no need to delay, every one of us is more capable than we may realize, even with one foot still stuck in the society of today. Learn things every day and practice them at earliest opportunity - partly to help today, but mostly so you can pass them forward. I can do that with a fair expectation of accomplishing something worthwhile, whereas I do not feel that way about trying to turn and change existing social organizations.<br><br><a href=since-green-wizards-project-got-under.html#c4490365186806643729 title="comment permalink">9/3/10, 7:13 AM</a><br><br>

They describe their Training 4 Transition workshops as not "training" as in they are going to tell you want you need to know, but more of a "get on the train" approach. My take on that is that it is more a club, but without a group decision-making process. They have to go back to their leader for advice from time to time. GW doesn't touch how to organize a community much. Maybe the GW site will be more simply a place of sharing info than anything else. I think there is something really positive in that.

But I felt different by the end of it.<br><br>First off, they explained, and I agreed, that by having to pay to go to a transition training course, only those who are really motivated will show up. You don't want people there who are not serious about doing something afterwards. Also, I can say that the people who put on these training sessions are not rich. Tina Clarke for instance drives around in a battered 3-Cyl Geo Metro and I don't think she even holds a regular job aside from stuff like this. If you've been to a TT you'd see how demanding it is of the trainers to speak for two long days almost nonstop, and to cover some really heavy topics.<br><br>They are kind of like Jimmy Stewart in Mister Smith Goes to Washington. It's a real marathon.<br><br>Also, I have a good friend in Maine who had his whole trip to Chinatown subsidized. The Trainers often pick certain people out for extra help for one reason or another, and they sometimes do followup work. This occured recently in Putney, VT.<br><br>I think anyone who goes through the Training course is much better equipped to start a Transition group than someone who merely reads the handbook. It's also incredibly powerful to sit in a room of 20 people from the area who are into peak oil. In the process of 2 days I felt that I bonded with everyone in the room. When all else fails, you will have developed, if not local, then regional contacts in the meat-space which means a lot if all you had before were nameless people on the internet.<br><br><a href=since-green-wizards-project-got-under.html#c2987797398509516259 title="comment permalink">9/3/10, 6:07 PM</a><br><br>

Many of the clubs, committeess, and organizations I've ever belonged to have ended up in acrimony, side-choosing, schisms and hurt feelings. Maybe it's just the nature of human nature, or at least the nature of the kind of people who try to organize things, but even in groups where everyone ostensibly has the same goals there will be dissent and power grabs and all kinds of unproductive game-playing. Endless meetings are the least of it. The meetings that end badly are even worse. Well-intentioned people end up drifting away, and even if the original group achieves its original goals there is often a lot of wasted energy.<br><br>It's impossible to know enough to be able to predict the future or run an economy (which is one reason why a market economy in which millions of independent actors making billions of decisions works better than a centrally-controlled economy in which an all-knowing elite make all the decisions). Chairman Mao made a lot of really bad decisions, but he did get one thing right: Let a thousand flowers bloom. Lots of green wizards doing their own thing may have a better chance of "success" (however you want to measure that concept) than a pre-conceived plan that may be based on incomplete data. <br><br>Is the downside of Hubbert's Peak going to be long and smooth, or steep and bumpy? What happens if Iran and Israel go at it with nuclear weapons in, say, 2012? What happens if the Greenland ice sheets start to slide into the ocean ahead of schedule? The best laid plans of mice and men... <br><br>Everybody else probably should be ready to learn what the green wizards can teach them, but exactly when that ends up happening will depend on a huge number of variables that we cannot predict, let alone control. About the only thing that we can get a handle on with any accuracy is the nature of human nature, as revealed by history and literature. I don't know if that should make us optimistic or pessimistic, but it is what it is, and we should probably think twice before we lay any grand plans.<br><br><a href=since-green-wizards-project-got-under.html#c2185025084725838550 title="comment permalink">9/3/10, 7:28 PM</a><br><br>

Transition US (and worldwide) is highly centralized and authoritarian, requiring (in the US, at least) certification and payment of fees to a central body, as well as getting authorized teaching materials from that central body (Transition US). It's a top-down hierarchical structure, with pretty strict control over what gets said and what gets taught. <br><br>It's really a substantial break from what Transition started out as being, when at one point there was an online, free version of the Transition Manual being published as a wiki (http://www.appropedia.org/The_Transition_Handbook) which got pulled down in 2008 just as Transition US got its start. Of course, wikis are the antithesis of central control... and Appropedia.org is still a great resource, uncorrupted by the Takers who seem to have taken over the Transition Movement.<br><br>In contrast, Green Wizardry is non-hierarchical, anyone can be a Green Wizard, you just have to do whatever it is you do, and share the skills and knowledge that you've got. No one tells you what to do or how to do it. <br><br>GW is well-adapted to the process of relocalization, TT is not, requiring reference to central authority for teaching materials, and payment to that same central authority for certification. <br><br>The usual new-agey bit of trademarking everything in sight now seems to apply as well with Transition, as well as selling information and keeping intellectual property safeguarded. It's a radical break with the way the Transition Movement began. <br><br>Really, if the information is as important as the Transition people are trying to get people to believe, then it's pretty immoral to put a price tag on it, it's like charging a fee to get on a life raft... and it's bloody stupid, because there are a lot of people who aren't going to ante up or can't ante up, who have vital skills which could be crucial to any sort of effort.<br><br>In my not so very humble opinion, the Transition Movement as it stands now is an utter betrayal and travesty of what it started out as, and should be re-formed to get back on its original path, before making heaps and scads of money seemingly became one of its main goals. Now it's nonsense, it's just another variation on a New Age moneymaking scheme.<br><br><a href=since-green-wizards-project-got-under.html#c3864029108725570602 title="comment permalink">9/3/10, 8:34 PM</a><br><br>

Just one point of response: there are doubtless some situations in which consensus-seeking and consensus-building are what's needed, but in my personal experience I know of very few of them. Most of the time, again in my experience, consensus is either a vehicle for unacknowledged hierarchy to work without having to be up front about it, or it's a very, very efficient way to waste time and destroy a group. That is to say, when it appears to be working, watch carefully and you can very quickly sort out who is managing or manipulating the structure from a position of unacknowledged power to make it work; when nobody is in such a position, it doesn't work. <br><br>Tony, please see the comment by Panidaho above, or go to the forum again and check the FAQ pages.

The society was one, worked as one, was as efficient and focussed as possible and struggled as one, with the situation in mind: Win or Die in a Camp (the situation was on a knife edge).<br><br>But - there were times when an individual would go outside that unity. They would do something to benefit themselves, to be selfish or waste resources on a whim.

Here, I'm emphasizing the value of the <i>attempt</i> to reach a consensus, whether successful or not.

I just wanted to clear up some misconceptions. First of all, Consensus decision-making is not the same thing as "consensus building". There are a number of business management books that use that term, but the process is more about getting your employees to agree with you. There's a lot of pseudo-consensus out there, so a lot of people get a bad impression of what Consensus is, thinking they've experienced it, when in fact, they haven't. I've heard this with people who know consensus from the old SDS, or Green Party conferences, or Rainbow gatherings.<br><br>Consensus is not unanimity! Consensus is not even about getting people to agree. It is not about agreement. Consensus is about consent. Consensus is a process of sifting through a proposal looking for concerns. The group works on making the proposal the best and making sure it lines up with the groups vision and goals. A proposal goes through with consent (again not agreement). Good meeting guidelines include a description of the only criteria someone can block a decision, like if they believe it is against the already stated mission and vision of the group. Blocking is not the end of the process. It continues from there, often with a counter-proposal.<br><br>In Consensus, people don't look at proposals in terms of what is best for the individual, but what is best for the group, and raise concerns in that light. That's a huge difference from making decisions by the mathematical sum of individualism.<br><br>So, what here is being called discensus can fall under the category of Consensus decision-making. C.T. Butler titled his book on Formal Consensus "On Conflict and Consensus". He states that Conflict is essential. That is, it is essential to look for concerns in proposals. It's not about making everyone agree. Dissent is essential.<br><br>Here are some helpful links on Consensus decision-making - www.consensus.net, http://treegroup.info/topics/, http://www.seedsforchange.org.uk/free/resources<br><br>If the moderator will allow, I will also separately post the Consensus process from the Iroquois Confederacy. It's not online. I got it from the Mohawk Nation.<br><br><a href=since-green-wizards-project-got-under.html#c7428631004569485700 title="comment permalink">9/4/10, 9:01 PM</a><br><br>

The words "emergence" and "self-organizing" are thrown out as part of Transition 2.0 (both words being as meaningless as the word "holistic"). Michael Brownlee, from Transition US, at a talk I had gone to here in NJ in speaking of the official Transition stance, spoke against community organizing, and said that formal group decision-making processes like Consensus or Robert's Rules of Order can sometimes be against the principles of "emergence" and "self-organizing". He said people who come from a community organizing background may find it a hard fit with the Transition philosophy. He spoke in the context of talking about what the Transition position is, which he shied away from doing in most of the talk. This to me sounds like The Tyranny of Structurelessness, where they have to keep going back to the boss to find out what the official word is at any time whether it's 1.0 or 2.0 or something later down the road. Getting popularity throughout many communities doesn't mean that any of those communities understand effective community organizing.<br><br><a href=since-green-wizards-project-got-under.html#c3917660575303061529 title="comment permalink">9/4/10, 9:08 PM</a><br><br>

Being an IC person doesn't make me not a Green Wizard though. I think both Rob Hopkins and John Michael Greer both put down IC's for being isolationist "lifeboat ecovillages" that are "self-selecting". Green Wizardry is pretty specific to skill acquisition, though, so someone could be a GW and be involved with Transition initiatives or IC's.<br><br>I believe community organizing is essential! When I've talked to people about my wife and planning a common treasury, 501(d), intentional community, I have heard a good many people speak about how they really want to be involved with the local community, not isolated. This is the assumption a good many people still have. . . of a hippie commune hidden from civilization in the woods. Albert Bates once wrote to me, "Another thought is that ecovillages are not lifeboats. You can't grow your own food in a lifeboat. It gets you off the ship and safely ashore. Ashore you will find both transition towns and ecovillages. I continue to be active with both.<br><br>I tend to think the TT analogy better fits lifeboats."<br><br>Another assumption we get is that we are trying to "save the world" and that IC's won't save the world because not everyone is into community meetings and cooperative sharing. While I think those skills would be very, very useful in a world in decline, I'm not trying to save the world. I have no idea how to effect societal change. I can only imagine the community level. For my wife and I, we like the concept of community as family, where the community takes care of individual needs and individual members take care of the community. We look forward to getting on the land (hopefully within the next 12 months) and homesteading, foraging, starting cottage industries, building appropriate technology DIY projects (like the passive solar food dehydrator, passive solar water distiller, and the pedal-powered washing machines that I'm building) with others, and supporting each other in the ways we can.<br><br>The round of various blog posts on community were a great start to a very important topic. I think that this RH and JMG "discussion" touches slightly on it. Overall, I think the importance of effective community organizing is not highlighted enough! Yes, that means meetings! It also means learning skills for effective meetings that don't drag on into the night, that don't lose focus and touch on everything from economics to sprituality to finance reports. It means learning facilitation skills that acknowledge different ways people communicate, that give voice to everyone, that keep people on track, and that hold people responsible to their actions and words.<br><br>If a community does not work on these skills of people-focused governance, then they will have to rely on someone else doing the governance for them, or more accurately to them.<br><br>I'm not saying that everyone needs to focus on IC's. That's just what we're interested in. We're also interested in being involved with our local community, and organizing with whoever is interested in a non-IC context.<br><br>The main point is there is no such thing as self-sufficiency. The self is not the level for sufficiency, the community is.<br><br><a href=since-green-wizards-project-got-under.html#c5242834540286299137 title="comment permalink">9/4/10, 9:25 PM</a><br><br>

Are people lining up at the pumps for hours? Are mine and my neighbors conversations dominated by oil and environmental concerns? In Ireland I can emphatically say this is not the case. Its BAU land, and people are just waiting for the consummer economy to mend itself before we begin another wave of debt and consumption. <br><br>Sure there are a small, most times very minute, number of people in various areas surrounding me that have some awareness that things just aren't right. Yet, their responses span from the ecotechnic (they'll buy fuel security with high tech devices); to the basic belief that making a few pots of jam will ward off bad times; to the ability to ignore all information and frame present conditons within past conditions: ". . . sure it's bad now but its just like it was back in the 1980's when immigration and money were tight."<br><br>Which is a round about way of saying that conditions, local to be sure in the fullness of time, will ultimately decide on how people organise. If there is even a very modest recovery in the economy, the pot jars will go back into the cubbards forgotten. The ecotech devices will become conversation pieces while a new SUV is purchased. Going by past experience, people's resource and environmental concerns will melt like snow on the ditches - if only for a brief moment this time around.<br><br>These present social conditions, allied with the various agency and govt departments around the world who are finally and explicitly telling us that conditions have changed with regard to peak oil and the environment, are guiding my response to up-skilling; along with the green wizard project, of course.<br><br>When I make decisions about people whom I might want to share activities with in regard to sufficiency and sustainability I use hard criteria. How close are they in case travel is serverly restriced. What skills, activities and mind sets do they have, and how can their and my skills mesh. Again, conditions will determine the efficacy of our efforts to find common ground, but I cannot expend my own limited energy and resources on what might happen or what other people might say now but do differently when confronted with a real shift in conditions.<br><br>Right now, and given the conditions, the green wizard project allows me to use my limited resources in the best possible way. When the muck hits the fan, whenever that might be or, worse again, if conditions change very slowly and unappreciably with regard to the awareness of the vast majority of people, I can then gauge what community responses are worthy of engagement given my own personal assessment .<br><br>Right now and right here the GWP make me think, makes me learn, and make me do. I cannot control macro economic conditions nor my neighbor's various attitudes or behavior. I can only attemp to control my own.

But community can mean many things. <br><br>In my local area, "community" to over 80% of the population already means "The Church" and this is the way it has been for over 100 years. If we, as non-churchgoers, want to participate in any serious community preparations for sustainability here, then reality dictates that we will have to join The Church in order to do so. Trying to import a community model that operates on a totally different type of political and social ideology will never work for this area. In fact, it would likely be seen as being in competition with what is already being accomplished by The Church. At the very least, it would be considered redundant, and therefore, totally unnecessary. (Honestly - given that The Church already has a fairly robust and long-standing system for growing, processing and moving local food and supplies to those who are in need, maybe in some ways it *is* a bit redundant.) <br><br>So, Green Wizards may not be the entire solution for everyone, but for us, it gives us at least a partial solution and also allows us the possibility of developing something of value to share later with others in the community.<br><br><a href=since-green-wizards-project-got-under.html#c7958164060892004561 title="comment permalink">9/5/10, 9:44 AM</a><br><br>

Essentially, JMG addresses different questions, and addresses them differently, and Hopkins took him to task for this.

I hypothesize that one of the reasons the Grange and other lodges succeeded as long as they did was that they didn't let just anybody join; they were able to exclude the parasites who wanted what the group had to offer (socially or materially) but had no intention of contributing or had the mistaken impression that their directionless blathering constituted a contribution. Of the many intentional communities launched during the Vietnam draft years (a term I'm trying to promote instead of "the Sixties" since it's a much more accurate representation of the period) the ones that failed tended to be anarchistic and open to anybody who walked in, while the ones that succeeded tended to be based on a well-defined set of values and ideas (usually but not always religiously derived) and to have rules and discipline and a mechanism for throwing people out.<br><br>Once the hard times really hit, exclusivity may mean casting people out to starve.

This clearly represents a basic difference of opinion between those who are more enamored of 21st Century "high tech" versus those who feel more drawn to simplicity and directness. I do have to say, in my own life and my observations, when people around here of limited means are looking for a solution to an energy or food or shelter related problem, they/we tend to make choices more in line with the things JMG is talking about. Two cases:<br><br>Our drinking water comes from a spring that is at about the same elevation as the house, so to have indoor pressurized plumbing we need to do some pumping. The spring is also a good ways from the house. In this present-day world, flexible black poly pipe is cheap, copper cable is expensive. I essentially had three options: 1) run grid power to an electric pump; 2) set up a photovoltaic/battery system to run a pump without the hundreds of feet of copper; or 3) put in a ram pump (a pre-electric centuries-old technology made easier in the present day by readily available plastic pipe and brass valves). I chose 3, because it was far less expensive both in the initial cost and in the maintenance. Low tech beat high tech.<br><br>Just earlier today, I was talking to my neighbor and he mentioned his astronomical heating bills from last winter; he heats with propane. Is he thinking of getting a ground-source electric heat pump installed? Not a chance. Passive or active solar? He is kinda interested, but is gonna watch my experiments with those this winter first and see how it goes for me. No, he's gonna put in a wood stove and power it with the abundance of scrap lumber and timber available to him. The 19th Century beat the 20th and 21st. <br><br>Now of course JMG would be the first to point out that we are not really stuck in the 1970s; technologies promoted then have gotten even better. "Airtight" (a misnomer) woodstoves widely used now deliver much more heat into the house and send less of it (along with less air pollution) up the chimney than what we had in the 1970s. I don't think anyone is really talking about rewinding 35 years in the details of the technology. It's about revisiting the ideas, concepts, and basic methods, with the advantage of another four decades of development and hindsight.<br><br><a href=since-green-wizards-project-got-under.html#c404838927314747824 title="comment permalink">9/7/10, 3:07 PM</a><br><br>

I know personally some of the people who give the trainings - it happens for them maybe 4-6 times per year, usually at the request of TT groups with interested people who want to get involved. The $2k fee generally covers airfare, lodging, meals, and a couple hundred bucks left for their "fee" as trainers for much more than a weekend's work.<br><br>As much as we'd all admire people doing this for free, nobody I know can afford to do so. Besides, just as with Permaculture, the Master Gardener/Composter programs, or backcountry skiing, you can pick up a book and try to do it yourself for free. Many people find it worth their time, however, to pay for a lesson or class to learn this new thing they want to do, thereby avoiding many beginner mistakes and having a mentor from whom to seek advice.<br><br>I never took the TT training class, but I was fully involved in the local TT group as one of the initiators for a year. It's not required to take the class, and the fact that they offer the training for a fee really just lets us know who it's for: people who like weekend workshops as an initiation into a "movement." <br><br>That said, I'm better pleased with JMG's Green Wizard approach - I can't stand weekend workshops!<br><br><a href=since-green-wizards-project-got-under.html#c6434569543238647910 title="comment permalink">9/7/10, 8:01 PM</a><br><br>

BTW, doing an alternate wifi network might be a good idea to work on, it's line of sight and building it could be relatively inexpensive (although not easy - there'd have to be a lot of thought and plain hard tedious work done to realize it). Or you could get a 1921 edition of Audels Engineers and Mechanics Guide - I've got vol. 8, "Wiring and Electrical Reference", which illustrates how various components work and can be built, from dynamos to "pictures and writing by radio" - a precursor to what we know as a FAX machine. I'll bet that a series of books like this might end up being worth its weight in gold...<br><br><a href=since-green-wizards-project-got-under.html#c8288148948054560117 title="comment permalink">9/8/10, 12:15 AM</a><br><br>

I may be distorting or exaggerating, but I seem to recall the description of Transition movement activities as a revitalization movement: that is, a desperate attempt at maintaining an unsustainable way of life. My understanding has been that JMG sees Transition towns as unsustainable both at the physical level (the energy they will require is simply not there), and at the social level (whatever hierarchical structure is put in place will inevitably lead to power imbalances, rights violations, etc.). GW is being discussed as complementary to TT, but it seems to me that it is designed more as a safety net for ANY future society, including TT, and that JMG expects TT to fail alongside currently existing systems for the same exact reasons.<br>I would LOVE to be set straight about this.<br><br><a href=since-green-wizards-project-got-under.html#c2763740291674126650 title="comment permalink">9/8/10, 10:52 AM</a><br><br>
