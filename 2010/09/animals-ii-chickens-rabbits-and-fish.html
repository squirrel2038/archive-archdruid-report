When people think about animals in the context of rural homesteading or backyard gardening, odds are the earthworms and bumblebees discussed in last week’s post won’t be the first thing that comes to mind. The reason for this is simple: they simply aren’t tasty enough. I recall a book I read years ago with the winsome title <i>Butterflies In My Stomach: The Role of Insects in Human Nutrition</i> that made a strong case for dining on insects, but I confess to never having put its recommendations into practice; and as for earthworms, I’ll leave them to those with bolder palates than mine.<br><br>No, the animals most often contemplated in this context are those that provide food a bit more directly, and palatably, for our species. This isn’t an unreasonable habit of thinking. Though the earthworms, bumblebees, and other wild creatures that interact with a garden or a farm probably play a more important role overall in green wizardry, domesticated livestock of various kinds have a crucial place in the backyard food economy. Their task is to take biomass that human beings either can’t eat or don’t find very nourishing and turn it into more edible and more nourishing forms.<br><br>Now of course this is not the way modern industrial agriculture generally does things. I’ve commented before that if an evil genius set out to design the worst possible way of producing food, his most diabolical contrivances would have a hard time competing with the way we grow food in America today. The animals we raise for human food in this country come out of millions of years of evolution that has fitted them to eat foods that human beings don’t, and turn them into foodstuffs like those that human beings evolved to eat. Do we feed them their proper foods by putting cows out to pasture, say, or letting chickens scratch for insects and vegetable scraps? Of course not. <br><br>Instead, we feed them on grains that could just as well be food for human beings, laced with chemicals and drugs, and “enriched” as often as not with the ground-up bodies of other animals that have been discarded as unfit for human consumption. We do this, mind you, in vast energy-wasting warehouse facilities so overcrowded and poorly managed that the manure, which would otherwise be a valuable resource for improving soil fertility, becomes a massive problem – and of course nobody would think of dealing with that problem by any means as sensible as industrial-scale composting. Meanwhile the meat, milk, eggs, and other products of this system are a sickly parody of the equivalents that can be gotten from healthy animals fed their natural foods in sanitary and humane conditions.<br><br>Plenty of people who object to the appalling conditions and ecological cost of factory farming have responded by swearing off animal foods altogether. This is certainly a choice, but it’s far from the only option, and some of the arguments that have been marshalled in defense of it simply won’t hold water. Those of my readers who find that a vegetarian or vegan diet suits them should certainly feel free to continue their herbivorous ways, but not everyone finds such diets appropriate to their needs, and those who find a place for animal products on their dinner tables are part of a long hominid tradition; our australopithecine ancestors ate meat, as indeed chimpanzees do today, and it may be worth noting that no surviving or recorded preindustrial culture anywhere on Earth has had a traditional diet that does entirely without animal products.<br><br>It’s important to remember, also, that there’s a middle ground between eating the products of industrial factory farming, on the one hand, and abandoning animal foods altogether. One way to pursue that middle ground is to buy animal products from local organic ranchers and growers whose operations are open to visits by consumers. Another, though, involves a glance back toward the household economies of an earlier time, when a henhouse in the back garden was as much a part of most urban households as a stove in the kitchen and a roof overhead.<br><br>Like food plant growing, in fact, animal raising can be done in one of two ways, extensive or intensive. The extensive approach, in preindustrial societies, is called pastoralism, and was the foundation of one of the two great human ecologies to evolve out of the hunter-gatherer lifestyle around the end of the last ice age. Where the early agriculturalists set themselves to domesticate plants they once gathered from the wild, the early pastoralists set themselves to domesticate animals they once hunted. Both new human ecologies had their growing pains and their catastrophic failures, but both worked out most of the bugs, and will be as viable after industrialism as they were before it. It’s pretty much a foregone conclusion, for example, that the Great Plains four or five centuries from now will be inhabited by pastoral nomads whose raids against the agrarian towns of the Mississippi-Ohio basin will impose the same ragged heartbeat on the history of the future as their equivalents on the central Asian plains did for so many centuries in the past.<br><br>The cattle herds and nomad raiders of 25th-century Nebraska are a bit too far off for present purposes, though, and the closest modern equivalents are out of reach for anyone who doesn’t have enough acreage for the cattle and horses that will define those nomads’ lives. This is where the intensive approach comes in. Just as backyard gardens can produce a significant harvest of vegetables when worked intensively, a backyard henhouse or rabbit hutch can produce a steady supply of animal foods when handled in the same efficient and intensive way. This does not mean putting the animals in some small-scale equivalent of a factory farming operation; rather, it calls for a comfortable shelter and space adequate to the needs of the number of animals you have, along with ample food and clean water, provided by your efforts rather than the less generous habits of nature.<br><br>Hens and rabbits are not the only animals that can be raised this way, but for people who don’t have enough real estate to set aside a good-sized piece of pasture, they are among the best. Both can be kept comfortable and healthy in a relatively small space, thrive on an inexpensive diet, and produce abundantly and reliably if treated well. Hens are particularly good for those with tender feelings toward animals; you don’t have to kill them to be nourished by them, since half a dozen hens will keep a couple of humans amply supplied with eggs for most of the year. Rabbits don’t have that advantage, and neither do chickens raised for meat; most people I know who raise either one respond to the hard necessity of slaughtering by doing their level best to see to it that their animals have only one bad day in their lives.<br><br>To be healthy and productive, hens and rabbits need comfortable, well-ventilated, rainproof and clean housing, well enough insulated to keep off summer heat and winter cold. They need food, and in any sort of intensive setting they won’t be able to forage for themselves; you’ll need to keep the feeder stocked, whether it’s with food you grow yourself or with something from a local grower or a feed store. They need water, and they need to have their manure hauled away, though admittedly they repay this last bit of regular effort by providing some of the world’s best raw material for compost. (Animals concentrate nutrients, and a regular dose of chicken or rabbit manure mixed into your kitchen and garden waste in the compost bin will speed the composting process and boost your soil’s fertility dramatically.) Animals also need various kinds of incidental care at every stage of their life cycle from birth to stew pot. <br><br>What this means, ultimately, is that if you choose to raise small hens or rabbits, you or someone you trust will have to be there for them every day of the week, every week of the year. Other animals have other needs, but for all practical purposes, all of them require daily care. The precise requirements are too complex to cover in detail here; they can be learned from the many books available on the subject of each animal, and if at all possible supplemented by useful advice from someone who has actually raised the animals in question.<br><br>What are some of the other options for small-scale animal raising? Pigeons have been raised for many centuries on a backyard scale; if you have a little more room, ducks, geese, turkeys, and guinea fowl can all be raised successfully. On the larger scale, too, goats and small pigs are good options; the Vietnamese potbellied pigs that were briefly fashionable as pets in America, for example, have gone on to become a staple of small-scale pork raising. There are more exotic options that can be found with a little searching. Perhaps the most intriguing of the alternatives, though, are fish.<br><br>Microscale aquaculture was a central focus of the New Alchemy Institute, one of the most innovative and inspiring of the appropriate technology groups back in the heyday of the movement in the 1970s and 1980s. Tilapia, one of the more popular farmed fish these days, was one of the Alchemists’ discoveries; their Arks, or integrated ecoshelters, included tanks for tilapia that provided water and fertilizer in the form of fish feces to greenhouse crops, as well as a steady harvest of fish. I’ve never worked with small-scale aquaculture and so have no practical knowledge to offer here, but the concept seems to have worked well in practice, and green wizards who are unfazed by the technical challenges could do worse than look through the papers of the Institute, which are available via several sites online, and start experimenting.<br><br>Whether finned, feathered, or furred, animals are a much greater challenge than vegetables. More biologically complex than plants, they are equally more fragile, and require a great deal more care; the same concentration of nutrients up the food chain that make them so delectable to human beings also make them equally prized by other predators, and the sort of hearty nip that most plants can shrug off without incident will put most animals at risk of infection or bleeding to death. Even among green wizards, they aren’t a suitable project for everyone, but those who decide that raising small livestock is a challenge they want to take up can contribute mightily to the larders of their households and, on a broader scale, to the resilience of their families and communities in a world where factory farming will be no more than an unhappy memory.<br><br><span style=font-size:130%>Resources</span><br><br>The standard Seventies-era book on backyard livestock, found on the shelves of every back-to-the-land homesteader of the naked hippie era, was Jerome D. Belanger’s <i>The Homesteader’s Guide to Raising Small Livestock</i>, which covers goats, chickens, sheep, geese, rabbits, hogs, turkeys, guinea fowl, ducks, and pigeons, in no particular order. An overview rather than a detailed guide, it needs to be supplemented with specific books on whatever animal you decide to raise, but it provides a good first glance over the options and some very good pointers as well.<br><br>The books I relied on back in the day when I tended chickens and rabbits were Leonard S. Mercia’s <i>Raising Poultry the Modern Way</i>, Bob Bennett’s <i>Raising Rabbits the Modern Way</i>, and Ann Kanable’s <i>Raising Rabbits</i>. They remain good solid texts, though there are plenty of newer books on the market, and the backyard animals I didn’t raise also have a literature of your own. Your best bet is to find someone who currently raises the animal you have in mind and ask for suggestions; in most cases you’ll find yourself with a new friend, and plenty of good advice.

I have just started with chickens this year, and I'm loving it! At first I wasn't sure about raising them for meat, but I've become quite attached to my six hens, so for now they are providing eggs, fertilizer and de-bugging the garden. I've even taught them to eat slugs! (there's a YouTube video that shows how). You are right about the daily care. I've been able to leave for max 1.5 days, leaving lots of water and food. But I'm using it as a handy excuse not to go to gatherings I didn't want to go to anyway. :-}<br><br>Possibly, if crisis causes food to become a big issue, I might build a larger flock and not get so attached to them... but that's in the future.<br><br>BTW - I just checked over at the forum, and in two weeks, we have over 1,000 posts, and one short of 600 members! That's awesome!<br><br><a href=#c6275961839571261819 title="comment permalink">9/15/10, 7:21 PM</a><br><br>

OMG, the goat cheese! Goat brie, goat gouda, goat feta... Yeah, we could get into that.<br><br>Organic or self-sufficient gardening and animal husbandry are obviously the best way to produce good food, but just cannot compete with big-time factory farming in terms of cost (eggs at our local supermarket are on sale for $0.99/dozen, so what's the point of raising your own chickens to produce eggs that cost more per egg?). BUT, if the grid goes down, or the supply of petroleum is cut for even a short time, growing your own food could be the best insurance policy. Home-grown eggs at $0.99/egg are so much tastier than no eggs at all at $0.99/dozen...<br><br><a href=#c2616061423150329920 title="comment permalink">9/15/10, 7:48 PM</a><br><br>

I think more people are starting to question where their eggs, and other foods are coming from and wondering if it might be a good idea to start asking city council about allowing chickens. This is an inner city thing, the suburbs still aren't ready to risk the property devaluing phenomenon of chickens at this point, but there are small signs of hope.<br><br>In order to make backyard chickens a financially sound idea, you'd also have to square yourself with the idea of producing feed for them, or the cost may be prohibitive.

As for the forum, I'm completely gobsmacked by the way it keeps on expanding. Thank you for your hard work on it!<br><br>Moose, you've put your finger on a crucial point -- narrow analyses that only take money into account miss more than they catch. The store-bought eggs cost $0.99 a dozen because the real costs are offloaded onto the community and nature; meanwhile your own chicken's eggs come with benefits the price doesn't reflect. <br><br>Onion, if you buy laying mash from the feed store, you may bust your budget. If you do some research, figure out how much of your own chicken feed you can grow and what else you can use that's cheap, the cost will be...well...chicken feed.

<div class="avtb a_61c74c" id=c3035709794981028528></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/02333438671130100114 rel=nofollow>Bill Pulliam</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Re: eggs and store bought feed: I find if I feed my hens more store bought feed I get more eggs (surprise, surprise). The cost comes out to be about $2-$3/dozen eggs. About what I can buy eggs for from the same small-scale commercial farmer up the hill who feeds his hens the same store-bought feed. So, like, whatever...<br><br>I find people in general have a very poor grasp of the basic concept you outlined: The purpose of a food animal is to take things you cannot or will not eat and turn them in to things you can and will eat. It is NOT to take things that are perfectly good people food and turn them into a much smaller quantity of people food. Animals should get a large portion of their diet from range and forage (which includes bugs and even small frogs and lizards in the case of chickens), cellulose, garbage, scraps, partially digested manure, etc. Otherwise you are trading one dollar for two shiny nickels. "Organic" does not necessarily mean this -- "organic" poultry, eggs, dairy, etc. are usually made by feeding the critters the same grains and supplements as conventional, except that these feedstocks were organically grown. <br><br>Intentionally or otherwise, producers and promoters of "alternative" animals use this lack of understanding to mislead consumers and small-scale growers. My particular pet peeve is pastured poultry. These birds may spend all day sitting on nice green grass, but 80-90% of what they eat is still the same old pelletized chicken feed produced from from the same old grains, soybeans, etc. From an energy flow perspective they don't look much different from conventional poultry; they are still made mostly of petroleum in the end. The same is true for many boutique meat and dairy products. "Local," "organic," "free-range," etc. still often means "made from petroleum" in the end. <br><br>If you don't feed these conventional feeds, you have several tradeoffs. Your animals grow slower. They produce fewer eggs and less milk. Your results are less predictable. You can keep far fewer animals in the same area. BUT you are not basing your food on petroleum, and you will not be spending all your cash (or all your time if you grow the grains yourself) feeding your critters! <br><br>Plus you've never really seen an egg until you see one produced by a hen who eats near 100% wild food. The yolks are deep orange and you can pick the yolk up with your bare fingers without breaking it. The aroma and flavor are, well, it's comparable to the difference between a store-bought tomato and a fresh home-grown one. Amazing to think that japanese beetles, crabgrass seeds, and spring peepers can be turned into something so delicious just by being passed through the innards of a small feathery toothless dinosaur.<br><br><a href=#c3035709794981028528 title="comment permalink">9/15/10, 8:53 PM</a><br><br>

Entertaining as well as providing eggs and meat!<br>We dehydrate the carrot tops and beet greens over the summer to supplement winter feed, and have harvested sunflower seeds from the garden flowers to add to the bucket as well as growing a small plot of grain specifically for the chooks. It's barely a half-bucket full, but if we HAD to ... we could get more. A few grains grown in a small space plus the peelings and leftovers from meal preparation and chickens are pretty happy, even in winter. You wouldn't need a whole lot of 'bagged feed' to keep them happy.<br><br>A hanging bucket type feeder and waterer (or large trough) can keep them going for several days, if you get it arranged properly, so they don't always need a lot of looking after.<br><br><a href=#c2261076388544201599 title="comment permalink">9/15/10, 9:07 PM</a><br><br>

We buy feed. We find it costs us about the same as buying eggs. Not at .99/doz, more like $3 - $4, which is what they charge for "organic free range", which is what ours are. But, you get free manure, and buy your eggs a month at a time.<br><br>We started trying to grow feed this year, in the form of sunflowers and seedy squash. Next year we'll add walking stick plant.<br><br>It does tie you down, which is why we don't have milk animals. Finding someone to feed the poultry and collect the eggs for a week or so is not too hard.

Home harvested wins every time. The quality is superb, and of course you can't beat HH for freshness. Fresh eggs have a solidly identifiable four tier structure easily apparent to the naked eye. When you crack a fresh egg into the pan, the whites should form a well defined small circle almost instantaneously with a deeply coloured yolk perched pertly atop.<br><br>Yet, there's no way to compete on economy of scales employed by industrial hen/egg production. Proper bedding alone will make an egg to egg cost comparison futile. So why try?<br><br>I found through trial and error, and through advising others, to start off very small. As hens are flocking birds, three hens to start off with seems ideal. You keep costs in resources, including time, to a minimum and you give yourself time to learn through experience. A rooster isn't necessary for the beginner. A bad bugger is worse than no rooster at all. You'll still get your eggs, albeit possibly with a smaller production quota, and in the abscence of the fella strutting about you'll eventually need to replace hens, as they age, from a realiable outside source.<br><br>One vital component that many people tend to ignore is water. It's vital to the hen's health and production capabilities that fresh water be provided daily - more frequently during hot weather. A small investment in a gravity assisted water feeder is worth every penny. Keep the water feeders in a cool, shaded place, and make sure they are kept spotlessly clean - ie certainly no algae build up.<br><br>When expertimenting with feeding the hens household scraps try and stay away from feeding them processed/manufactured white bread. They deserve better, and you're eggs will taste better.<br><br>An investment in a good chicken book/manual is vital - even for a small flock, especially if you're in this for the long haul. <br><br>slán<br><br><a href=#c4387973723041480580 title="comment permalink">9/15/10, 9:52 PM</a><br><br>

Replacing the mowers with rotating herds of grazing animals may well be a welcome service for residents as well as the many churches, schools, and small businesses in the area. Then the resident chickens, or rotating flocks in portable "chicken tractors" can help scatter the manure, removing flies and parasites in the process. Some nice things about cattle in this scenario: They are more docile than goats and produce more milk. They are less vulnerable to the elements and predators including domestic dogs.

Goldratt. The pace is nearly pedantic, but some of the concepts are intriguing.<br><br>For instance, while working along on planned production, you may have extra capacity to offer something else at lower cost. When the "main" product line supports all your amortized costs, then the niche stuff cost is derived from resources actually used.<br><br>Get the chickens for your garden compost, and for your eggs. That cost adds up, but pays for the shelter and space. Add two or three hens, and get a dozen or two eggs to sell, in season - and the cost need not be concerned with shelter, water, etc. except what the additional birds consume - and you needn't offset the additions to the garden compost.<br><br>Or just provide the extra dozen eggs to a neighbor in need.<br><br><br>@ JMG,<br><br>What about "Kosher" animal products? I haven't looked into Kosher blessed products, but don't they have a reputation for humane raising, slaughter, and processing?<br><br>On another topic - I would thing being vegetarian or vegan would be tough, and still be "green". If you aim to reduce the plastics in your life, isn't leather the traditional alternative for footwear? If we lose access to the mass production of oil-turned-to-leather-substitutes in the future, I expect much more need for animals for their hides, and a return to curing leather. When industrial fertilizers are threatened - won't animal wastes be highly regarded, in order to produce the quantity of food needed?<br><br>Meat production may turn out to be incidental, in our need for raising and producing livestock like cows and hogs.<br><br>I have been keeping chickens for the last eight years - I was welding up the chicken house on 9/11. One issue I seldom see is successfully adding young birds to an existing flock, without getting all the young birds killed. The industrial approach of cleaning out all existing birds and replacing the flock avoids this issue, but isn't the only way.<br><br>You mention predators; I would caution anyone intending to keep chickens or other livestock to be prepared to kill predators. I have had to deal with snakes and possums so far. Foxes and predator birds don't stick around long enough to for me to assault. The only thing I ever successfully scared off was a young skunk - and that took a near-miss with a .410 shotgun. My preferred weapons include a three-tined pitchfork and a three-pound hammer with longish handle. Did I mention my steel chicken house, which would make bullet and pellet holes tough to patch?<br><br>Predator control also makes clothing safety and issue. Long, sturdy pants and sturdy shoes are much safer when dealing with livestock in general, and wildlife in particular.<br><br><a href=#c2385488907524425144 title="comment permalink">9/16/10, 4:47 AM</a><br><br>

They even swam in it for 6 weeks or so each year when the water in it converted enough solar radiation to warm the water. I noticed that they swam in it less this year, and I expect by the time my youngest is 18 or so, other diversions will distract his attention from splashing around in Dad's 33,000 liter water-collection system.

I have had some bad experiences in that department - some people, good-hearted, helpful people, simply do not have a "head" for animals and their needs.<br><br>The last time my partner and I went away for a few days together, we actually hired a local woman who does "barn sitting" for a living - she has a clientele of folks with small livestock operations, and takes care of them when they want/need to get away. She's a farm girl, and I trust her completely to know what to do in any circumstance.<br><br>I'm also best friends with the local vet. This becomes important if you will be having larger critters such as goats, sheep, and especially cows or horses.<br><br>The other thing that deserves amplification is predators. I live pretty well "out there" in the woods, and we have it all - hawks, foxes, coyotes, bears, fishercats, weasels, you name it. They all love chicken, after all, it tastes just like chicken!<br><br>We have had some horrible weasel events over the years - they are rather small and hard to keep out of the henhouse. Fishercats are bad, but they will kill one chicken and drag it off into the woods. Weasels go berserk - we lost 5 hens one night in what we though was a tightly secured henhouse. "Carnage" doesn't quite capture it.<br><br>If I'm going to be away from the place for more than half an hour, I put the sheep in the barn - the coyotes are just opportunistic as hell. And of course they go in for the night at dusk. Between that practice, and having 4 dogs running around a lot of the time (and formerly a horse), we have been mercifully spared a coyote attack, though I see them scouting us out once in a while.<br><br>It might just be easier to raise small animals in suburbia, where the predators don't roam quite as brazenly! But if your place is adjacent to any sort of woods/wild land, you'll need to give some very serious thought to protection from predators.<br><br><a href=#c1327268741682499486 title="comment permalink">9/16/10, 6:09 AM</a><br><br>

In the city I live in it's legal to have up to 10 chickens in the city limits with a caveat that if neighbors complain you loose your chickens.

Do they stud roosters out? I'm only half joking.<br><br>So for the sake of more self sufficiency I'm now thinking that maybe rabbits are a good choice. For the meat. I know next to nothing about keeping them (or chickens for that matter) but I'm going to learn. Maybe Guinea Fowl would be a better option. I would prefer to keep only one animal to keep cost down. This is an area where more research on my part is needed.<br><br>And I still haven't built the bat house. This is getting to the point where I will need to make a list and prioritize.

Weekend after next I am off to a workshop on raising meat rabbits, which seems the next logical addition for me, and too little considered. After plenty of bookish research and a couple visits to folks already doing it, I'm looking forward to some hands-on guidance in those areas where I'm still uncertain and getting started.<br><br>I've also looked closely at the aquaculture/aquaponics options. It seems a no-brainer if you have either a pond or perennial stream you can reliably tap. <br><br>But without either of these aquaculture seems mostly to offer a cautionary lesson in energy descent. Without lots of water you're looking at a recirculating system, which means a pump, which means energy. And there's virtually no room for error in that department: in a small recirculating system stocked at anything resembling typical density for food production, if you lose power for a couple hours you have a tank full of dead fish on your hands, for want of oxygen. (How's that for an illustration of Liebig's Law?) <br><br>Quite short of complete collapse of the grid it seems prudent not to count on 24/7 electricity in the coming years, nor on the fossil fuel-based systems that most folks depend on for backup generation. <br><br>With no wind to draw on, I'm left with solar. If I knew I could keep a small (even 5 GPM) pump running 24 hours a day for a few days on solar energy (with batteries) here in New England, I'd be happy as...well, happy as a fish in water!

The way I do this without angst is summed up in the old farmer's rule of thumb: <br><br>If you are going to eat it, don't name it. <br><br>This is really about intention. Animals you are raising for meat need to be approached emotionally-psychologically-intentionally in a different way from the very first instant. If all you have ever had before has been pets this will be a big shift. You don't care for them differently -- you make sure they are well fed and watered, not too warm or too cold, healthy, comfortable, and peaceful, just as you would for any animal. But from day one you look at them as food. When you watch their physical development, you think about the quality of the meat. When you admire their large muscular legs you admire it in terms of how tasty it will be. When you are able to see meat on-the-hoof or in-the-feather as future food, and you know your animals are well cared for and contented, butchering day is just the fulfillment of your well-executed and humane plan. I always referred to it as "turning chickens in to chicken." <br><br>If you are in the country there are also likely to be local people (try amish families or small-scale poultry farms) who will butcher your animals for you for a small fee. Personally, I prefer to do the dispatching myself. I've been responsible for these animals' entire life; I feel that I should be the one who wields the knife at the end of it too. But I'm an animist; others will feel differently. Done well and done at home, it's not even "one bad day;" it's more like "a few bad minutes." <br><br>OK the squeamish should scroll down now... seriously, I mean it!<br><br>When hand "processing," you don't wanna wring a chicken's neck or cut its head off. One key to really tasty chicken meat is to get as much blood out as possible (without having it splattered all over your farm). Yes, a beheaded chicken really does flop like a landed fish, sometimes actually scrambling around on its feet. Its a horrible mess. But a chicken with a wrung neck dies with all its blood in all its tissue, which is responsible for a gamey, metallic flavor. What you do it put the chicken upside down in a killing cone, pull the head gently through the bottom to extend the neck (no force!), and using a carefully wielded razor sharp knife you cut the jugular. Done right, the bird feels almost nothing; they don't even flinch or squawk. They get dizzy, pass out, and die; those involuntary death contractions happen after the bird has lost consciousness and are contained by the killing cone. The blood goes neatly into your collecting bucket instead of on the ground, on your clothes, on the walls, etc. Within minutes it's over, your chickens are now chicken.<br><br><a href=#c3959147869101141785 title="comment permalink">9/16/10, 8:48 AM</a><br><br>

As long as your goals are the same as the goals for the class you look at, and the same as the judges pursue, then the prize winner is what you want.<br><br>Because birds or crafts or whatever wins - was tuned closely to meet the published criteria. It has been years since I looked at poultry exhibits with any attention at all. I recall classes and award for meat birds - most gain in least time. For egg laying. I don't recall ratings for thrift, for maintaining good condition on least feed or least quality feed. I don't recall competition for richest compost additions. I don't recall competitions for being trainable, for being aggressive against predators, for being good brooders or pleasant disposition. Or for eating bugs and maggots.<br><br>I also don't recall birds graded on genetic diversity. In fact, many modern practices tend to inbreed lines, and use artificial insemination to artificially concentrate the gene pool for "desirable" traits (accepting the risk of concentrating undesirable/lethal traits).<br><br>I would suggest taking chicks or young birds from someone with a decent reputation for business, and healthy birds. The more local the better, as the birds will be more closely adapted to your locale. Find someone that has chickens, and pick their brains.<br><br>If you only get hens at first, you get to skip the genetics worries, and all you need are some reasonably performing birds that will need to be replaced, eventually. That, or a rooster can be added in a year or two.<br><br>Note that roosters should be rotated out as well if you keep chicks back for replacement hens - or you risk inbreeding and resultant loss of a robust gene pool. <br><br>You will notice that all the chicken books (that I have seen) and all the modern techniques call for destroying the hen when she gets to be a year old or so, because "production is reduced in older birds". (You might find that someone with a good operation going may be willing to part with older hens "near retirement" for a pittance.) Two points - if you aren't producing eggs for a commercial enterprise, the dropoff isn't that dramatic, usually, and the feed and care to raise a new replacement bird takes time with <em>no</em> production. Next is lights. Commercial producers use lights for 12 or more hours every day, to force chickens to lay eggs year round, instead of letting the shorter daylight hours in winter divert that energy into surviving - and thriving! - in winter. If you aren't forcing the laying, chickens (evolved from roosting in trees over winter) need protection from wind and drafts - but not much for insulation in winter. The only heat I use is for the waterer, for my convenience. We get spells down below -10F each winter, with long stretches below freezing.<br><br>Modern practice has separated strains for how they brood. Some breeds brood - set a nest until hatching. Others have been selected to *not* set - which means gathering eggs is handier, you don't have to fight the hen for possession of the eggs.<br><br>I figure letting the hen set a clutch each summer, and no lights so that winter eggs fall off naturally, reduces the aging on the hen. Plus, I tend to separate hatched chicks and raise them, then re-introduce them to the flog. When I let the hen keep the chicks (I always leave her a couple), they seldom last a third day. From what I read in Storey's Guide for chickens, I should probably move the hen to a brooding box. Maybe next year . .<br><br><a href=#c2921245565026495098 title="comment permalink">9/16/10, 9:11 AM</a><br><br>

If eggs are the goal though, ducks are not too city friendly because, unlike hens, ducks are noisy. However, if meat is the goal, city dwellers could most likely find duck egg farmers who'd love to sell extra, almost silent drakes for city folk to use as weed and insect control and then for meat. <br><br>I know this because I have four drakes that have to leave before they reach sexual maturity in two months. I'm hoping to find breeding homes for my guys since they are top of the line Welsh Harlequins, but I'm realistic too.<br><br>Another small livestock breed I recommend is Barbados Blackbelly Sheep. I'm allergic to wool, so I'd given up all hope of owning sheep until I ran into a local breeder. Barbados Blackbellies are hair sheep, not wool sheep. The meat is also leaner than typical lamb.

These need as much or more daily care than chickens and rabbits. Hiring a responsible teenager or neighbor to take care of your farm critters when you go would be cheaper than kenneling your pets. Half of our chickens roost in the maple tree in the front yard rather than in their chicken house anyway, and they all drink from the creek and can feed themselves from wild food 100% if need be. So caring for them is pretty easy -- open or close a door, throw a little food out so they remember where they live. Non-lactating hoofed critters aren't much more trouble either -- check the food and water, open or close the doors or gates. A few minutes twice a day. If you've got someone producing milk then it's more of an issue; find a neighbor who knows how to handle a teat and be prepared to reciprocate!<br><br>Of course this is only the case if you only have a modest number of animals. If you have a large goat herd or are raising hundreds of chickens or rabbits for market then everything changes; but in that case you are really running a business, not just a household, and you need to plan and prioritize accordingly.<br><br><a href=#c4488339455672539350 title="comment permalink">9/16/10, 10:25 AM</a><br><br>

That's part of the reason why I asked everybody to read a book on ecology -- the role of animals in expanding the reach of the food chain that leads to us is central to the strategy. <br><br>Apple Jack, some friends of mine who had chickens and children used to use the former to entertain the latter, and kept their garden free of slugs, by encouraging the kids to find slugs to toss to the chickens. This evolved into a game of slug football -- you toss the slug onto the centerline, and the chickens mob it, tussle with one another, and run here and there. Wherever the slug gets eaten is where the next one gets tossed. First slug eaten in either end zone is a touchdown. Kept 'em busy for hours. <br><br>Glenn, thanks for the voice of experience!<br><br>Joel, thanks for the book suggestion -- I'll check it out. <br><br>Blagroll, exactly.

Almost always this animal will be acclimated to a much more industrial way of living than you have planned for it. Examples: breeding rabbits that don't like to eat vegetables - only pellets. Chickens that don't know how to hunt for bugs very well and rely heavily on standardized feed. In my experience, neither of them have learned. The time you spend raising a young animal is worth it in the long run.<br><br>2. Chickens and rabbits complement each other very well in many aspects. When I started keeping both, the improvement in the compost - and then in the garden - seems almost synergistic. <br><br>3. It is much more difficult to breed rabbits than you might think! Be ready to lose a few litters.<br><br>4. Killing meat animals is very difficult the first time you do it. But you quickly learn that the better you are it, the better things are for everyone.<br><br>5. Bill P was right - I don't name animals I plan to eat.

We've carefully tracked the costs of raising our animals over the years, and at the same time we've watched the prices at the grocery for eggs and meat, and what we've found is that it's actually cheaper for us, because the price of eggs and chicken fluctuate seasonally. For the most part, our costs stay static. Occasionally, the price of feed will go up or down, but mostly in the four years we've had chickens and in the ten plus/minus years we've raised rabbits, the cost of feed has stayed mostly the same. We heavily supplement our animals' diets with stuff from the kitchen and from the garden, and save a lot on feed in that way. Our most significant feed costs come from raising the meat chickens, and really, the meat in the grocery store is not comparable to what we raise, but for the sake of the curious, raising our own chickens, including the cost of using a butcher (the cost to raise the meat chickens would be pennies per pound if we butchered them ourselves) costs us about $1.89/lb for the chicken meat. But, as I said, it's just not the same and for my family of five, one of our chickens is the equivalent of three meals.<br><br>I've discussed keeping small animals as part of a suburban homestead on my blog many times over the past several years. It's interesting the arguments I hear against it. The thing most people don't seem to want to understand is that it doesn't have to be chickens or rabbits or ducks. Livestock animals come in many forms - like quail instead of chickens. They're tiny, they're quiet, and they can be raised for both eggs and meat. I just think people need to be open to alternatives rather than just saying it can not be done, which makes this series you're doing that much more valuable ;).<br><br><a href=#c3839636770056402517 title="comment permalink">9/16/10, 11:50 AM</a><br><br>

After two years and a half, I also can fill the freezer with the steer. <br><br>I tend to have a bit of different opinion than Cherokee on where to find the best birds. Maybe because the situation is different in Australia than North America. What you see at fair these days are show birds, not birds selected for production. The extra bucks you pay is for the look. Bloodlines of traditional birds still kept and selected for their production traits are few and far in between, unfortunately. But they are worth looking for. <br><br>Kosher slaughtering is not the nicest way to dispatch an animal by the way. <br><br>Laurie,<br>Totally agree with your comments on breeding rabbits being quite harder than it looks. After years of breeding sheep and chickens I thought rabbits would be a breeze. I gave up after loosing a couple litters.<br><br><a href=#c5332628138009888884 title="comment permalink">9/16/10, 8:25 PM</a><br><br>

Most of them have had names, and we are only eating the eggs so far - but as the kids get older and the flock gets bigger, I notice that more of them seem to remain unnamed generic chickens. So I'm about ready to move to the next step (thanks for the tips Bill!). We have a friend who has chickens with names, and the rest she refers to as "Tastys".<br><br>We have about 30 birds that roam free most of the time. We often don't even bother to close them in anymore, as our livestock guardian dog pretty much keeps everything away - though I think we may be pushing our luck in that department. We got 2 years ago her because the foxes were taking all our best birds in the spring when they had kits.<br><br>This summer several hens snuck off into the woods nearby and emerged with more chicks in tow than we had planned. Usually you get about half roosters, and we only keep a few of them around at any one time - usually the ones that are really pretty and that are not too hard on the hens. The rest get shipped off to the local auction. And yes, the roosters crow - that's how you know when it's time to get up. Every now and then you get a really obnoxiously loud bird, and those will make the process Bill described that much easier.<br><br>The eggs! I have no use for those pale things they sell in the store - there is nothing like a fresh egg from a foraging hen sizzling in an iron skillet, with a bright yellow yoke.<br><br><a href=#c1663448134627928129 title="comment permalink">9/17/10, 10:50 AM</a><br><br>

I would estimate many times that. Are you buying any grain and, if so, is it organic? We raise 52 meat birds per year (one per week) and the feed bill is stupendous for that 10-12 week period while they are growing. The birds are cornish cross and they do forage. I am always trying to figure out ways to lower the cost of the "inputs." One thing we do is to feed the excess goats milk to the birds in the form of panir (milk heated and vinegar added to produce curds and whey.) Both the curds and whey are good sources of protein. To the list of plants I would add siberian pea shrub. My latest experiment has involved building a hoop house out of cattle panels and attaching it to the coop. I am raising earthworms under pallets so chickens can't get to them except on a limited basis. Hoping that with proper care and feeding the worms will continue to reproduce through the winter. I don't know whether this will work. In my area (Northeast US) organic pasture raised poultry goes for $6.00/lb and up. It would have to be way way higher for me to even think of selling my birds after all of the work and feed I have put into them. <br>For an all purpose bird that grows quickly, survives in the cold and produces both meat and eggs I recommend the light brahma. <br>I had a friend long ago whose mother was raised on a farm in Ireland. She was shocked at the poor quality of feed in American poultry farms. I asked her what the chickens on her farm ate and she replied "They ate what we ate." <br>I want to add another word of support for goats. They eat all of the stuff that we call invasive or weedy and turn it into milk. However, many goats come from situations where they have become loaded with parasites and many have a disease called CAE. Because they are such easy keepers many people are careless with them. Be careful when you get them that they are tested. As with chickens, it is better to find a breeder who is careful with a closed herd and then get little ones who will grow up under your care.<br><br><a href=#c6708826438024825615 title="comment permalink">9/17/10, 11:11 AM</a><br><br>

It was through our daughter’s desire to “be in 4-H” that we first became part-time pig farmers, raising two market animals and another for the freezer for half of each year, leading up to the animal show and auction at the county fair. And it’s through meeting and working with other swine club members and parents, the 4-H folks, our veterinarian, fair judges, and even some online sources, that we’ve gathered the basic information on how to best raise our animals. We sort through what we’ve heard, ask a few more questions and then get to it, because nothing teaches quite like experience (and follow-up questions).<br><br>In fact, 4-H, and the county or state fair, is a great place to reacquaint yourself or reconnect with many of the sustainable-practice, self-sufficiency-fostering “rural arts” that used to be such an important part of American culture, everything from bee-keeping (the Bee Barn is very close to the Hog Barn at our fair), to food preservation (you’d be amazed at what they can pickle!), to yarn-making and the many other heritage skills that might find resurgence in the coming post-industrial years.<br><br><a href=#c465018144757690672 title="comment permalink">9/17/10, 12:38 PM</a><br><br>

They’ll defend the flock against anything and will freely sacrifice themselves by running away from the flock, and/or toward the attacker to keep the others safe.<br><br><br>Pigs<br>-- Pigs don’t take up a lot of room, but the neighbors will notice, so do let them know what you’re up to first! <br>-- “Regular” market pigs are NOT light on the environment, but they will turn over nearly any soil (if the soil gets rained on) and eat almost any plant, including blackberry plants, thorns and all.<br>-- Watching the dispatch of a pig is a horrible, bloody, but I think necessary thing to behold (once! Although if my 4-H gal witnessed this now, that would be the end of us raising pigs!)<br>-- Good pork sausage is, as one my daughter’s soccer teammates exclaimed, “like...meat candy!”<br><br><br>Also, more generally:<br>-- Growing today’s genetically over-engineered meat animals can be a freaky experience. Our roaster chickens went from baby chicks to 6lbs each, dressed in freezers bags, in 7 weeks! Pig growth isn’t quite as weird, but we do raise 25lb shoats to 250lb+ market animals in only 6 months!<br>-- You don’t need much to have your animals well taken care of while away; you’ll want auto-feeders and waterers, but mostly just need a friend or neighbor willing to help out for a spot of fresh eggs, chicken, pork, etc. Who doesn’t know someone like that?<br>-- It helps, I think, to “speak your peace” with the animals before slaughter, thanking them for their undoubted sacrifice to your well-being. One of the key reasons we assented to our daughter’s participation in 4-H, so she would become better aware of how and where her food comes from.<br>-- If you can’t or don’t want to stomach the butchering, barter locally with someone who can. I developed/maintain the website for a local animal “processor” and now he manages the “deed” for me.<br><br>Sorry for the long comments. I’ve read your most sensible, erudite and also entertaining writings for some time, commented only rarely, but today you've wandered into an area I actually have a spot of experience in!<br><br><a href=#c899887904485122381 title="comment permalink">9/17/10, 12:47 PM</a><br><br>

Those that choose to are locked up overnight in the chicken house, but some prefer to roost in the maple trees. I've not actually noticed a whole lot of extra mortality among the arboreal sleepers. We have coyotes, foxes, bobcats, raccoons, skunks, great horned owls, cooper's hawks, minks, as well as neighbor's dogs. Of these the raccoons and dogs have been the biggest chicken thieves. Breeds vary enormously in their survival here. Some of the best results have been with Americaunas (plus you get green and blue eggs) and Black Sex Links. Worst results have been with Buff Orpingtons (too docile and unwary) and the sibling breeds of Dominicker/Barred Plymouth Rock (too fragile). There are exceptions in every case, of course. Our sturdiest and smartest hen was a gift from a neighbor, appears to have fighting cock bloodlines, she has spurs as big as most of our roosters'. But she was the first to figure out how to not get hit by cars and taught all the rest of our birds this trick (almost no roadkills since she joined the flock 3+ years ago), and was our first to successfully raise wild-hatched offspring to adulthood with no intervention from me. But she's a lousy egg producer. Tons of tradeoffs in the chicken world.<br><br>For a heritage free-range meat breed, I don't think you can beat the Dark Cornish. Also fighting cock bloodlines, tough, scrappy, big and meaty, MEAN as a junkyard pitbull. Grow fast for a heritage breed (12 weeks to slaughter instead of 7 for the genetic mutant freaks), and absolutely incredible rich full flavor. Wear tough leather gloves when handling them, since they bite HARD (no going gently into that good night for them!). <br><br>If you let your hens raise their own chicks, you'll get a nice genetic mishmash, and you will be selecting for birds that do well under your conditions. But you are also selecting for hens that go broody, meaning weeks and weeks of no eggs while they sit on their nests. <br><br>Roosters -- I don't even hear the crowing when I am sleeping anymore. Roosters are far more likely to get eaten by predators, which is a major plus in a free-range flock. The boys sound the alarm and challenge the intruder while the girls run for cover; the boy gets eaten but there are more where he came from. A good rooster can be amazing to watch with youngsters he considers his own, constantly on vigil, watching over them, always talking to them, helping them find food, crowing and bristling at any sign of an unwelcome guest. A free-range flock with no roosters is less safe and more disorganized.<br><br><a href=#c3251624356319249746 title="comment permalink">9/17/10, 9:26 PM</a><br><br>

The neighboring house, which had a fair amount of land, was owned by an Irish family who kept chickens and geese that roamed freely (sometimes into the house).
