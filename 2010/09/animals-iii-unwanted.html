In the sort of imaginary world where candy canes grow on trees and financial crises caused by too much debt can be solved by adding even more debt, the only animals a backyard gardener would ever have to deal with would either be small livestock who keep the refrigerator full, or helpful critters from the surrounding ecology who come fluttering or slithering in on cue to pollinate plants, turn plant matter into compost, and generally make themselves useful to the garden and the gardener. Alas, we don’t live in such a world, and if you have a backyard garden, you’ll be dealing with plenty of other animals whose goal in life is to eat the food you grow before you can get to it.<br><br>Call them the Unwanted. If that sounds like the title of a second-rate Western, that’s not wholly inappropriate, because most American gardeners seem to think of them in terms borrowed from Hollywood cowboy flicks: your garden is the inevitable happy but helpless Western town, the animals we’re discussing are the black-hatted bandits, and you’re the gunslinger with the tin star on your shirt who stands there in the middle of Main Street waiting for the baddies to show up, with both hands hovering over the grips of your six-sprayers.<br><br>Popular though the image is, it’s not a useful approach to managing a garden ecosystem. The idea that you ought to control unwanted animals by squirting poisons all over everything may not be the dumbest notion in circulation these days, but it’s arguably pretty close; a healthy garden, remember, is one with a diverse population of living things in balance, and the toxic compounds too many gardeners like to spray all over everything are just as deadly to bees and other helpful creatures as they are to the ones you think you need to get rid of. Most of them aren’t exactly healthy for you, either, and dumping poisons on your own food supply is not generally considered to be a bright move.<br><br>For that matter, it’s not even an effective way to get rid of the critters you don’t want. It’s important to understand why this is the case, because it points up a crucial difference between the unhelpfully mechanistic approach that governs so many activities in contemporary industrial society, on the one hand, and the ecological approach that ought to guide your work as a green wizard, on the other. Imagine, then, a big field full of a single crop, sprayed regularly with a chemical poison to keep some insect or other from dining on that crop. In ecological terms, what do you have?<br><br>What you have is a perfect environment for any insect that can learn to live with the chemical poison. That insect is looking at an abundant food supply, helpfully guarded by a chemical “predator” that will take out other insects who would otherwise compete for the same food supply. Offer evolution a chance like that, and it won’t be slow to take you up on the offer – which is why losses to insect pests for most crops in the US have risen to levels not far below those that were standard before chemical pesticides came on the market, even though most pesticides are being used at or above their maximum safe dosage per acre.<br><br>It doesn’t help any that nearly all chemical pesticides are single chemical compounds, each of which interferes with the biochemistry of its intended target in one and only one way. The fetish for chemical purity that runs through so much modern technology has many downsides, and this is one of them. Plants that have evolved chemical defenses against insect predators use as many as a couple of hundred substances that attack an insect’s biochemistry at many different points, an approach that makes it extremely difficult for ordinary random mutations in the insect population to work around them. Rely on a single compound with a single chemical pathway, though, and you make things easy for evolution; one mutation in the right place is all that’s needed, and sooner or later the luck of the draw will go in the insect’s favor.<br><br>The same bad habit, interestingly enough, lies behind the explosion of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in recent years. Any given antibiotic relies on a single effective substance with a single impact on the bacteria it’s supposed to combat; even the sort of antibiotic cocktail used so often nowadays has only two or three active ingredients. Compare that to St. John’s wort (<i>Hypericum perforatum</i>), which is best known these days as an antidepressive but had a much bigger role in traditional Western herbal medicine as a medicine for wounds, and contains dozens of antibacterial compounds – hypericin, rottlerins, xanthones, procyanins, resins, oils, and more. It’s precisely this complexity that makes it impossible for microbes to evolve resistance to herbal treatments.<br><br>Crusaders on their way to the Holy Land used to take a wineskin, stuff it with St. John’s wort flowers, and fill the skin with olive oil; by the time they got to where the fighting was, the oil was blood red, and they used it to dress sword wounds to keep them from festering in the not exactly sterile conditions of a twelfth-century military camp. American laws being what they are, I would probably get in trouble for practicing medicine without a license if I encouraged you to consider herbal remedies such as St. John’s word for infection, or even recommended that you read such excellent books on the subject as Stephen Harrod Buhner’s <i>Herbal Antibiotics</i>, so of course I’ll do no such thing.<br><br>The same logic, though, can be applied with a good deal less risk of legal trouble to a backyard garden. Instead of trying to get rid of unwanted creatures in your garden by the simple-minded and easily circumvented approach of a single poison, you need to change the environment so that it no longer encourages the Unwanted to hang around. That isn’t as easy as squirting poison all over everything; it requires you to learn about the life cycle and environmental needs of each of the creatures you intend to discourage, and to figure out ways to deprive them of things they need, make your garden welcoming to things that eat them, irritate, annoy, and frustrate the living daylights out of them until they throw up their forelimbs in despair and go bother someone else.<br><br>Sometimes a few simple things will do the trick. One classic way to keep raccoons from eating your sweet corn before you get to it, for example, is to intercrop the corn with some vining plant that will twine all around the cornstalks. Raccoons hate unstable footing, and the tangled, sliding mess of vines you’ll get around your corn will often annoy them enough that they’ll settle for the contents of your neighbor’s garbage can instead. Combine that trick with other methods of making life annoying for raccoons – for example, raccoons detest baby powder, and this can be sprinkled liberally on corn ears and leaves to make them leave corn alone – and barriers of the sort raccoons can’t easily get past – for example, once the silks have turned brown and pollination is over, you can cover individual ears with old knee-high stockings held on with rubber bands, and – and the fellow in the bandit mask isn’t likely to bother your corn much.<br><br>Some insects, similarly, can be dealt with by the simple expedient of physically removing them. On a large farm this would be a herculean task, to be sure, but in a small intensive garden, it becomes workable. Japanese beetles, for example, can be handpicked off your vegetables; do it first thing in the morning, when they’re still groggy, and put a tarp on the ground under the vegetables to catch those that fall off. In effect, you become an additional predator of Japanese beetles, and put enough pressure on their population to keep it from getting out of control. <br><br>In much the same way, one very effective way to limit the number of slugs in your garden is to find the places they like to hide in the daytime and remove these, except for one nice convenient board left flat on the ground in the middle of the garden. Every day, go out and gather up all the slugs that have hidden under the board, and feed them to your chickens, who will be delighted by the treat. (Those gardeners who lack chickens can drop the slugs into a pail of salted water.) Do this regularly and you’ll keep the slug population of most gardens down to the point that damage to plants is minor at best.<br><br>Not all problems with the creatures who want to eat your vegetables, or for that matter your animals, can be solved that easily. Any gardener worth his or her salt has a couple of good books on pest control, and takes the time to learn as much as possible about the habits and weaknesses of insects, mammals and birds who have to be controlled if you’re going to get food out of your garden. A few good over-the-fence conversations with local gardeners can also clue you in to methods that have been evolved locally. A garden notebook, kept up to date with notes on what works and what doesn’t, is another valuable resource.<br><br>Perhaps the most important resource, though, is the awareness that in planting and tending a garden you’re working with an ecosystem, not running a machine. Machines require purity; ecosystems thrive on diversity, which is the opposite of purity. This means that you should have many different crops growing in your garden at any given time, and they should be intercropped rather than grown in nice neat blocks, so that an insect or a plant disease that gets started on one plant can’t simply hop to the next one. It means that you should be prepared to use a series of partial deterrents when something that likes to eat your vegetables gets out of balance with the system, rather than attempting a knockout blow that may just knock out something you need. <br><br>It also means that you need to accept that a certain number of your plants are going to get sampled by other living things, and concentrate on keeping that number within acceptable limits, rather than trying to drop it to zero. You may not want raccoons and slugs in your garden, but they play necessary roles in the wider ecosystem, and as a green wizard – rather than a poison-toting sprayslinger – your job is to learn to work with that wider system in ways that work for all concerned.<br><br><span style=font-size:130%>Resources</span><br><br>Two excellent books on keeping your vegetables safe from your rivals are Rhonda Massingham Hart’s <i>Bugs, Slugs, and Other Thugs</i> and Helen and John Philbrick’s <i>The Bug Book</i>. Most organic gardening books also contain useful hints on keeping the Unwanted at bay, while books on raising small livestock such as chickens and rabbits almost always discuss ways to keep predators from dining on your animals before you do.<br><br>***********************<br><br>Even archdruids need to take vacations now and then, and the pressures of my other writing projects have made something of the sort a good idea just now. As a result, I’ll be taking next week and the month of October off from <i>The Archdruid Report</i>; expect my next post – on another dimension of the Green Wizards project – the first week in November. Until then, enjoy the harvest season, and keep on with your studies!

This is "proper hobbit stuff" as a friend of mine calls it. Enjoy the holiday.<br><br><i> American laws being what they are, I would probably get in trouble for practicing medicine without a license if I encouraged you to consider herbal remedies</i><br><br>You're not kidding... and UK laws are no better.<br><br>For anyone planning to make any use of store-bought herbal medicine (and even vitamins I'm told), there may be <a href=http://www.pranapositive.com/shm/ rel=nofollow> trouble ahead</a>. There are laws on the books for 2011 that will prevent obtaining that stuff without prescription apparently. No joke -- that site is run by some friendly MPs trying to reverse the situation.<br><br>Not much point perfecting your use of Chinese Tonics to remain in tip top condition (thus unburdening an overburdened NHS) if they swipe your access to poria cocos and codonopsis! If, like me, you'll be in trouble without this stuff and have been deliberately going over to it in order to look after your own health responsibly, you might want to fight this law which they are planning to enforce. Of course you can grow your own western herbs, but dashed if the whole thing isn't a big pharma lobby triumph.<br><br><a href=#c3406392264671050581 title="comment permalink">9/23/10, 7:01 AM</a><br><br>

Learning what garden plants are related to one another is very useful for this since the ones that are related often get the same diseases. That way you're not planting your melons in the same place your cucumber just got mosaic virus last year.<br><br>Also, I totally second anything that Stephen Harrod Buhner writes. He's amazing!<br><br>I've been dealing with rather larger pests this year. We had a groundhog decide to set up shop underneath our shed and he happily snatched every pumpkin we grew, chewed holes in the melons, and generally ran rampant through my garden. We finally got him to move out by sticking rocks into all of his tunnel entrances and blocking a hole in the fence once he was on the other side, but my cucurbits took a serious hit this year.<br><br><a href=#c30619092041643948 title="comment permalink">9/23/10, 7:20 AM</a><br><br>

Might be good to ask your neighbor gardeners what lives in their soil. Though if your Japanese is as good as mine, you're in for a long and meandering conversation that may or may not have anything to do with worms.<br><br>This year was our first with chickens, and we found they loved the slugs we picked out of the garden. Great idea about making sure the garden has just one slug motel. And it looks like our ladies auxiliary might help out with the Japanese beetles too:<br><br><a href="http://www.backyardchickens.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=718545" rel=nofollow>http://www.backyardchickens.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=718545</a><br><br><a href=#c5358258863259899373 title="comment permalink">9/23/10, 7:22 AM</a><br><br>

To take pleasure in the catbird, without worrying about the berries or my peaches. To observe the chewing beetles without hostility. But of course, that is a kind of willful blindness on my part to the war on nature that takes place "away" in the farms that grow my food, often enough in devastating monocultures. I know at some level that there is nothing more natural, (as in a true participation in an ecosystem) than going in there and competing for the things you need. Thwarting the catbirds and beetles enough to secure your existence. But I think I'll miss the illusion of being above it all. (I hope I never get so greedy or so desperate that I stop liking catbirds and beetles, though.)<br><br><a href=#c5098352851532110559 title="comment permalink">9/23/10, 8:14 AM</a><br><br>

The garden is the hole in the doughnut. Or the castle within the moat. The orchard is also in the moat. The chickens, ducks, and geese eat "drops" with my having to gather the fruit for them, and they clean up bugs on tree trunks and in the dropped fruit. But they also eat any slugs that are migrating through toward the garden. In the fall, after the bulk of the harvesting is done, we open a gate into the garden for a couple of weeks, and the enthusiastic birds rootle through the beds (and pathways), cleaning up both bugs and weeds (and some aphid-y brassicas) with little cries of joy. So far, so good.<br><br><a href=#c2961783633459855811 title="comment permalink">9/23/10, 8:38 AM</a><br><br>

While I actually don't mind brother bruin wandering through our yard a few times this time of year (though both bruin and my partner Alfred were startled to meet each other by the front steps one night last fall as Alfred came home from work), it makes proposals for public fruit trees, for example, dead in the water.<br><br><a href=#c8127586779108277063 title="comment permalink">9/23/10, 10:01 AM</a><br><br>

If your soil looks like it might needs heavy helpings of compost and worms, you might want to consider his method - composting directly into intended garden.<br><br>After loosening the soil, he sheet composted directly on top of the area he intends to plant. First, he mulched the garden with green plant waste (weeds, stems, leaves) in a 4 inch-layer. Then, he laid down a layer of high-nitrogen material (in his case, cottonseed meal, but this could be manure, vegetable wastes, etc.) and then on top of that, he put another layer of dried leaves.<br><br>Every 3 days, he mixed the pile with a tiller and kept it damp. After 20 days, he reported that the soil beneath was crumbly and dark brown and crawling with earthworms.<br><br>This method might help you because I have found it is much cheaper (or free) to buy / find material to compost with then to buy the compost directly. Also, this will improve the fertility of the entire bed of soil, instead of merely mixing in a sprinkle good soil into a patch of already dead dirt.<br><br>Reference: Rodale Book of Composting, New and Revised Edition. 1992.

Keep them down, but the odd weed that you've missed won't make much difference as long as you've manually removed 90% of the weeds.<br>As for animal pest control, insects that want to devour your veggies are best kept under control by regular inspections. Cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower and kale need to be inspected at least twice a week during summer to avoid larvae, but for other plants you can do it more seldom. But I'm not overly zealous about my other brassicas. If the a larva nibbles a bit at the leaves of my turnips I won't make a big fuss, as long as the plants aren't invaded and most of the leaves eaten.<br>As for slugs, chopping them in two is much more "humane" and simple than salt water.

Here in northern MD local organic farming operations have suffered significant losses to this pest. Luckily in my neighborhood, where pretty much everyone has a gardening operation of some sort; the crops have escaped unscathed this year, at least from the stink bugs, not so much from the drought. No one seems to understand the life cycle of these invasive species so everyone from ag extension offices to universities are pouring big bucks into figuring out how to control the invasion (the fact that there is an invasion in the first place deserves a rant in and of itself, but that is an entirely different issue, cheap crap from China anyone?) <br><br>Again, instead of attempting to implement IPM-type solutions to control the spread, what do we do? Return to old, outdated, and destructive chemical-based solutions from the devil’s pantry. It is the same old nonsense. I guess the line of thinking is similar to the BP disaster, if we throw enough money and commit our technology to solving the problem, it will disappear magically, no side effects, and no problems. To that end today Congress, in all of its infinite wisdom, petitioned the EPA to allow for the emergency and unregistered use of any pesticides found to be effective against the bugs. Apparently conventional sprays are not effective against the Asian marmorated, so Congress wants farmers to pull out the big guns and use some of the most toxic poisons in the arsenal to defeat the problem. Who cares about the side effects? If the stink bugs leave the fields, office buildings, and suburbia, then everyone is happy. It is a disgusting prospect, yet one that is in all likelihood fairly certain to come to pass. <br><br>As for us, we have found an excellent use for our swarm. Apparently what is a nuisance to a human is a five-star dinner to a chicken, and our girls have thoroughly enjoyed disposing of our problem in good fashion. It something that you and others mention all the time, let nature provide the solution, for it is always better than that which can be concocted by the industry.<br><br>Finally, enjoy your time away! It is certainly well deserved! Finally, I am looking forward to seeing you and hearing your discussion next weekend at Spoutwood Farm!<br><br><a href=#c5199846519387289896 title="comment permalink">9/24/10, 9:45 PM</a><br><br>

I'm impressed by the quality, consistency and quantity of writing content that you produce.<br><br>I can't add much to this weeks post as you covered most bases. We don't have raccoons, fortunately for us, as they sound like pretty fearsome beasts! This niche is filled by possums here, which I'm fortunate not to have as the trees in the surrounding forest have a slightly too high eucalyptus oil content for their palates. There's plenty of other things out there though to sample the orchard. Mostly I live with them and share the produce. It's easier and given the huge diversity in plants, there's always something that they've missed. The local animals also serve a very useful purpose too in fertilising, eating the bugs and keeping the grass down. The occasional bit of damage seems a cheap price to pay for their services.<br><br>A great quote comes to mind from Jackie French (who is am excellent organic gardener / small holder / writer in Australia) - "Concentrate on growing things, not on killing them". Nuff said!<br><br>I'm halfway through the Basic Ecology book and am quite enjoying it. The book reads like a manifesto for the environmental movement. I'm not personally an activist because, it's impossible to change the system without being caught up in the system and it can challenge and change your beliefs in ways you never thought possible. Look at Peter Garret (former frontman of Midnight Oil). I feel sorry for the dude. Nature will sort it all out in her own time, you can't cheat it.<br><br>I'm amazed that back in the 1950's when it was written, the problems that they explained and discussed are with us today still, except much worse and much larger.

This year, I'm thinking of grafting my tomato plants onto the new potato starts and letting them grow that way. My grasshoppers have never done any serious damage to my tomatoes, so I'm hoping this will lead to my first successful potato crop.
