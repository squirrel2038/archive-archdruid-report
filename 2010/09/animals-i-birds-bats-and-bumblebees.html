I should probably send Rob Hopkins a thank you note. I’m not at all sure he meant to draw attention to the Green Wizards project just as the forum at <a href=http://www.greenwizards.org>http://www.greenwizards.org</a> went live, but that’s the way it turned out, and the results have gone past my most improbable hopes. Measures of forum activity I’d hoped to pass in six months have been shouldered aside in six days, and the forum staff are scrambling to deal with a far more lively online community than any of us expected this soon.<br><br>To all those who have participated in the Green Wizards forum so far, I certainly owe a hearty thanks, and to judge from comments fielded there and elsewhere, the best way to express it is to plunge onward into the next phase of green wizardry and start handing out more practical information. That’s the agenda for this week, certainly, and the subject under discussion ought to be dear to the hearts of prospective green wizards. By the time you’ve finished with this week’s work, you may not be able to call spirits from the vasty deep as Glendower claimed to do, but you’ll be able to call helpful critters from the surrounding ecosystems to help maintain the balance of your garden – and yes, to forestall Hotspur’s gibe, they will indeed come when you do call them, if you do it in the right way.<br><br>Let’s start with basic concepts. A garden is an ecosystem managed in such a way that human beings get to eat a significant fraction of the net primary production of the plants that grow there. Net primary production? That’s the amount of energy each year that the plants in a given ecosystem take in from the Sun and store in the form of sugars and other compounds that can be eaten by some other living thing. Everything other than plants in any ecosystem gets its fuel from the net primary production of that ecosystem, or of another ecosystem that feeds energy into it.<br><br>You’re not going to get anything close to a majority of the net primary production of your garden onto your dinner table, by the way, and it’s a mistake to try; if you do, you’ll starve other living things that depend on a share of net primary production to keep their own dinner tables stocked, and you need these other living things in order to have a healthy and productive garden. (Ignoring this latter point is one of the critical errors of today’s industrial agriculture.) Your goal instead is to make sure that as much of the net primary production diverted from your table as possible goes to living things that earn their keep by doing something for your benefit. <br><br>Here’s an example. A certain amount of each year’s net primary production from your garden goes to feed earthworms. Any gardener with the brains the gods gave geese won’t grudge them their share, because earthworms break down organic matter into forms plants can use, and they improve the texture and drainage of soil as they do it. Charles Darwin – yes, <i>that</i> Charles Darwin – wrote a brilliant and too often neglected book on the role of earthworms in the creation of topsoil; what he found, to drastically simplify a classic piece of ecological research, is that earthworms are topsoil-making machines, and the more you’ve got, the better your soil and the higher your crop yields will tend to be.<br><br>Now the logical conclusion to all this, at least according to the logic of modern industrial society, is that gardeners ought to run out and buy earthworms by the carload. As it happens, this is rarely a good idea. There are bound to be some earthworms in your soil, and since earthworms are hermaphroditic and fertile most of the time, there’s generally no shortage of baby earthworms starting out on their slimy and subterranean lives. The question, if you’ve got a worm shortage, is why so few of them grow up to become the big pink nightcrawlers that haunt fishermen’s dreams.<br><br>This is where another of the fundamental principles of ecology comes into play. Liebig’s law, named after the 19th century German agricultural botanist Justus von Liebig, has the interesting distinction of being at one and the same time one of the most consistently valid principles of ecology and one of the most consistently rejected concepts in modern economics. The short form of the law is that for any organism, whatever necessary resource is in shortest supply puts an upper bound on the carrying capacity of the environment for that organism.<br><br>To understand how this works, imagine a plant growing in your garden. That plant has a variety of needs – water, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, an assortment of trace elements, and so on. If the soil is short of any one of them, it doesn’t matter if all the others are abundant; the nutrient in short supply will determine how well that plant can grow in that garden. Readers familiar with the rhetoric of today’s economists will recall the claim that if humanity runs out of one resource, we can always replace it with another; this claim amounts to insisting that Liebig’s law doesn’t apply to human beings – though it’s a rare economist who knows enough about nature to recognize that.<br><br>There are good reasons to think that the economists who make this claim are dead wrong, but that’s a topic for another time. The point that needs making here is that all the living things in your garden <i>are</i> subject to Liebig’s law, and if you want more of some particular organism in your garden, the way to get it is to find out what the resource in shortest supply is, and provide it. With earthworms, most often, it’s the sheer amount of organic matter in the soil that’s the limiting factor, and the more organic matter you put into the soil – by hoeing in compost, using mulches, planting green manures, or what have you – the more infant earthworms will mature to massive pink nightcrawlerhood and get to work improving your garden soil.<br><br>The same rule governs all the other useful critters you might want to attract to your garden. Bats are an example too rarely considered by organic gardeners. Why so many people fear and dislike bats is beyond me; any animal that can eat its body weight in mosquitoes in a single night, after all, should be a welcome guest wherever it goes. Still, the benefits bats bring to the garden outweigh the simple pleasure of not being eaten alive by the insect world’s answer to Count Dracula. Many of the grubs that cause serious damage to food crops – the corn borer, the apple maggot, and more – are the larva of night-flying moths, and night-flying moths are prime bat food.<br><br>The limiting resource for bats, nearly always, is daytime shelter during the non-hibernating months, and so one very easy way to bring bats to your garden is to build or buy a bat house and set it in an appropriate place. Both the house and its placement require a certain degree of care – bats, like nearly all other animals, are particular about their homes – but their preferences are well known and the resources given at the end of this post will provide you with the information you need.<br><br>Get a proper bat house in place, and in most cases you can count on a crew of bats finding it and taking up residence in a fairly short time, and thereafter any problems you may be having with moth larvae will become a good deal less severe. You’ll also be doing a good turn for the bats themselves; recently, a fungal disease called white nose syndrome has caused high death rates in many North American bats, and ensuring plenty of housing and habitat for the survivors will help bat populations survive the epidemic and recover quickly once it begins to pass off.<br><br>Birds are the day shift to bats’ night shift, and some varieties of birds are well worth attracting to your garden as well. Swallows, swifts, and martins – a closely related group of birds with tapering, pointed wings and a prodigious appetite for insects – are a classic example. Until the advent of chemical agriculture, farmers across North America went out of their way to encourage barn swallows to set up housekeeping in and around their farms, because swallows do exactly what their name suggests to a great many daytime insects that make life difficult for crops. Like bats and most species of birds, swallows and their relatives are particular about their homes; here, though, this is a double advantage, because homes well suited to swallows are uninviting to starlings and other birds that damage crops. <br><br>Another set of living things your garden needs is pollinators. The collapse of honeybee populations over much of the industrial world has been all over the news over the last few years, and for good reason. Without pollination by insects, many food crops don’t produce or reproduce, and honeybees have long been the primary pollinators of most commercially grown fruits and vegetables, with hives being trucked from farm to farm over hundreds of miles in season.<br><br>Exactly what is causing Colony Collapse Disorder is uncertain as yet, though some evidence points to a class of recently introduced pesticides – neonicotinoids such as imidacloprid – which are highly toxic to bees and can build up in a hive’s honey supply to lethal levels. Until the issue gets sorted out, making sure that your garden has backup pollinators in place is crucial. Domesticated honeybees are one option, but beekeeping is not a project for everyone; another, far less demanding option is to increase the population of local species of wild bees.<br><br>Spend some time outdoors watching flowering plants and you’ll quickly discover just how diverse a range of insects can play the pollination game. Many of them are bees of one kind or another, for there are thousands of kinds of bees, each with its own lifestyle and preferences. Very few of them have the complex social structure and hive life of the honeybee, and even fewer of them have a sting painful to human beings. Most are solitary, harmless, and short-lived, hatching in the spring and mating almost immediately, after which the males die and the females spend the rest of their lives laying eggs in burrows of one kind or another; each egg will hatch out the next spring as a bee of the next generation.<br><br>The orchard mason bee is one variety of solitary bee that has become a popular pollinator in some areas, especially where fruit trees are grown. The limiting factor for orchard mason bees is nesting sites for the females to lay their eggs, and this can be provided with a simple wooden block drilled with a lot of 5/16" holes. Nesting blocks for several other species with similar life patterns can also be made or bought; again, the resource section at the end of the post gives details.<br><br>Another common wild bee with a somewhat more complex life pattern is the familiar bumblebee, large and furry, that can be found visiting flowers through the summer months in most of North America. There are many species of bumblebees; all of them dwell in small underground hives which they build in abandoned burrows, and they have queens who live for several years and workers who live only one. The limiting factor in their case is not homes, but homes safe from predators such as field mice, who like to dig down into hives and eat the larvae. <br><br>The way to make Liebig’s law work in bumblebees’ favor is to take a small wooden box full of cotton wool, and with a short piece of old garden hose extending from a hole in the side maybe six inches. Bury the box in the ground in a secure, fairly dry place, so that the end of the hose just pokes out of the ground. Once a newly hatched queen finds it – which rarely takes more than a single spring – you’ll have a bumblebee hive full of pollinators who will do their duty for your garden and the wild plants around it as well.<br><br>All pollinators need something in flower to feed on for the entire period they are active, which for orchard mason bees extends from March to the end of May in most areas, and for bumblebees, depending on the species, can run from sometime in the late spring well into autumn. The absence of flowering plants can be a limiting factor for all kinds of bees, and if the area around your garden is short on flowers at some point in the season, a flowering shrub or two to fill in the gaps is a good investment. We have a buddleia in our front yard that serves as lunch counter for a dizzying array of daytime insects, including nearly a dozen species of wild bees; your local ecosystem will have appropriate shrubs that will fill the same role.<br><br>The same principle can be applied in many other ways. Just as you can encourage a species by figuring out what resource it needs is in shortest supply and providing that resource, in other words, you can limit an unwelcome species by figuring out its resource needs, and doing your best to make sure that one of those needs is as scarce as possible. As you work with your garden, and learn more about the complex ecosystem that an organic garden develops around it, pay attention to places where a little careful tinkering with variables can increase the population of something you want, and decrease the population of something you don’t want. It’s not so clumsy or random as a pesticide, as Obi-Wan might have put it: an elegant method of the more ecologically sane age toward which, willy-nilly, the pressures of the present are forcing us.<br><br>Resources<br><br>Net primary production and Liebig’s law are covered in most college textbooks of ecology, and if you’ve got one of those, it may be worth your while to read back through the sections discussing these two concepts.<br><br>For earthworms, Charles Darwin’s <i>The Formation of Vegetable Mould Through the Action of Worms</i> remains the classic study, and readers who can handle the leisurely pace and extensive vocabulary of an earlier age of scientific writing shouldn’t miss it.<br><br>For bats, Merlin Tuttle’s <i>America’s Neighborhood Bats</i> is a good introduction, and <a href=http://www.batcon.org/ >Bat Conservation Interrnational</a> provides extensive resources for bat house construction and other details of living around bats. For useful birds such as swallows, swifts, and martins, your local chapter of the <a href=http://www.audubon.org/ >Audubon Society</a> can get you information about the species that are local to your area and their nesting requirements.<br><br>For bees, two books by Brian L. Griffin, <i>The Orchard Mason Bee</i> and <i>Humblebee Bumblebee</i>, are good primers with plenty of detailed information; they are written from a Pacific Northwest perspective, however, and some of their advice may need adjustment in different climates.

When it gets to where it doesn't cool down below about 85° at night they simply stop blooming and become green straggly weeds.

No homework for me as I already have plenty of worms, not to mention resident bats and pollinators of every sort living on my minifarm. The bats I discovered my first year here, sitting in the attic at my pc in front of a window at night I could see them flying about. I had a pleasant/startling surprise one morning last summer when I headed down to the barn and saw a bat hanging upside down under the garage eave. I had never seen a bat hanging out there before, and haven't since. Don't know what happened to its normal hangout. Maybe an argument with Mrs. Bat?<br><br>The pollinators have been a different story this year. My usual scores of bumblebees seem sharply reduced, but replaced by a host of strangers. After some research I learned that one newcomer is a Hummingbird Moth. To be honest, I'd never seen or heard of them before. And I miss my orange-butt bees. I only saw one this year. I can't help but wonder if the change in pollinators is yet another sign of climate change...<br><br><a href=#c3318526856816525298 title="comment permalink">9/8/10, 7:07 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c5580548511306246418></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/03011278475953726477 rel=nofollow>Dalriada</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>An excellent post as usual. After several years I have finally managed to build a colony of swallows on my property, and also bats to take the night watch. I purchased a badly "human" damaged woodlot 8 years ago. It had been about 50% timbered in an effort to turn it into a maple sugar farm (monoculture of a sort). That same year an ice storm hit and made a twisted wreck of the place since many of the trees no longer had neighbors to rely on for support. We purchased it at a reasonable price and now have a guilt free source of hardwood for home heating. I have been selectively grooming and planting in order to restore a more natural balance to the forest, including restoring a hybrid disease resistant chestnut to its once native range. I made the decision to leave many dead trees standing(though not the real ugly's) since beautiful red headed and breasted woodpeckers were in abundance and I didn't wish to drive them off. Little did I know at the time that woodpeckers build some of the most wonderful natural bat houses you could ever ask for. Though parts of my property are marshy and I have a small pond, even at night the mosquitos on this deepwoods lot are now quite tolerable with no artificial help; other than their first arrival in spring until the birds and bats get working. Similarly the black flies are barely out of the gate before they are decimated. I get bitten more at a local baseball game at the high school now than I do at a campfire on my lot! Nature knows how to strike a balance, we humans just need to recognize it and learn to stay out of its way.<br><br><a href=#c5580548511306246418 title="comment permalink">9/8/10, 7:21 PM</a><br><br>

Most garden shops stock all sorts of exotics, because the exotics tend to remain unblemished and un-gnawed upon. But they remain untouched precisely because they're not part of the local ecosystem. Nothing eats them and nothing uses them. I've know I've adjusted my own aesthetics to see beauty not in the plant that stands pristinely aloof, but in the one that shows all the scars of actually being part of it all.<br><br><a href=#c1495195019668376766 title="comment permalink">9/8/10, 8:02 PM</a><br><br>

One is that bees need water as much as nectar and pollen. If you've got a nearby pond or ditch or some such feature that retains water most or all of the year, this may not be an issue -- but in dry regions or times, it could be a problem. The trick is to give the bees places to land so that they can drink without drowning. Our pond has plenty of duckweed and other aquatic plants, and we often see honeybees landing on them to drink. You could also put some rocks in a dish and then add water, leaving the tops of the rocks high and dry, and refilling as needed. I haven't tried this with mason bees or bumblebees, but I've got to think it would be good for them, too.<br><br>Secondly, about planting flowers to encourage pollinators: I'm not sure what the maximum foraging range of bumblebees and mason bees are, but honeybees are capable of flying over seven miles to forage. They'll stay closer to home if the foraging is good, but they'll still cover several hundred meters. In other words, you can encourage pollinators in your own garden by subtly encouraging your neighbors to plant lots of bee-friendly flowers -- even if they're not otherwise interested in your Green Wizardry. Or try guerrilla-planting them: we have a vacant lot behind our house, and I intend to carpet-bomb it with white clover seed.<br><br>Just a couple of thoughts -- I'd appreciate feedback by Wizards more learned than my humble self.<br><br><a href=#c4493957283497631205 title="comment permalink">9/8/10, 9:02 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avtb a_61c74c" id=c1483163832716372181></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/02333438671130100114 rel=nofollow>Bill Pulliam</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Folks in eastern North America interested in being landlords for Purple Martins should go to http://purplemartin.org/ for information on starling-resistant nest box holes. These crescent-shaped openings really do work to exclude Starlings and let in martins, but you have to cut them EXACTLY to specification! A few millimeters too big and you'll have starlings. It is also much better to have them in wood, not metal or plastic, as the birds have to squeeze in pretty tightly and can get abrasions on their backs from metal or plastic edges. Martin houses will also be used by Tree and Rough-winged Swallows if martins have not moved in or if the martins are in a tolerant mood. <br><br>DIY -- if you keep your sprangling tomato weeds alive through the summer bake-off into the cooler months, you might get a late-season crop. Tomatoes are a spring and fall crop in places with hot summer nights, which is likely to be a slowly increasing portion of the world. Cut 'em back if needed; once established, tomatoes are not especially delicate and can come back from just about anything short of a direct hit from a power lawn mower (sometimes even that). Even when they get reduced to mush by those great plains hailstorms they start to sprout back almost instantly.<br><br>On the other hand, peppers and eggplants should love those sultry nights!<br><br><a href=#c1483163832716372181 title="comment permalink">9/8/10, 9:17 PM</a><br><br>

This is the main driver determining which species grow well in each situation. It is also one of the main drivers of weed explosions in enriched then depleted soil.<br><br>Secondly the most effective way to get around Liebigs law is trade. This allows the most essential limiting factor to be brought in from somewhere else where it is abundant. Every plant does this by linking up mineral/water rich underground places with light/air rich above ground places. Human societies have always done it, for example by transporting flint stones into regions where they weren't a natural geological resource. Trade is one of the main reasons for multicellularity, sociality and sex.<br><br>Finally there is an additional layer to the problems of limiting resources. Often similar essential elements (e.g. calcium and magnesium) or nutrients (e.g. similar essential amino acids) are absorbed and transported by parallel biochemical mechanisms in a living thing. This means that a shortage of one (e.g. magnesium) is made even more damaging by an excess of the other (e.g. calcium). This can be an issue for example if you enrich your soil (or diet) with one of the pair, while extracting both through harvests.<br><br><a href=#c5089109958216916232 title="comment permalink">9/9/10, 3:38 AM</a><br><br>

Our neighbor had an old apple tree that he thought was barren. After a few years of us being here and planting all sorts of flowering plants - in particular herbs -, we discovered that his apple tree is most definitely *not* barren. It just needed some pollinators, which we attracted with our herb garden. The first year his apple tree bloomed and fruited, he gave us the fruit and we made hard apple cider. It was delicious!<br><br>And earthworms! Until I read your post, I didn't realize that my propensity for using leaves as mulch rather than the more familiar suburban cedar bark mulch (which is, admittedly, prettier) was the reason for our enormous (and I'm referring to their snake-like size here) earthworm population. I guess in this case it pays to be a bit cheap and lazy ... it's much easier to simply rake the leaves into one of my garden beds than it is to rake and bag all of the leaves ... and free leaves will always be a better buy, in my opinion, that bark mulch from the garden center :). <br><br>We have a bat house, and now, I think you've given me the impetus I needed to install it properly.

I know some people who wouldn't plant a single exotic plant on their properties, and even some who insist that their landscapes include only specifically local genotypes--being native to the region is not enough for them.<br><br>This kind of rigidity will end the day that these folks have to start growing some of their own food. Almost all of our agricultural plants are non-natives (although, of course, they were once native to <i>somewhere</i>).<br><br>Nevertheless, Andy Brown is absolutely correct that native leaf-eating insects cannot nibble on exotics. Native insects and the native plants they feed on co-evolved and are adapted to each other. Exotic plant leaves have chemicals in them that the native insects' metabolism cannot cope with, so they leave them alone. (Pollinating insects are usually not so picky, since they're normally going after nectar, which is essentially sugar water and does not contain inhibiting chemicals since it's biologically in the plant's interest for the nectar to be taken--a native bee or butterfly will take nectar from just about any source, native or exotic.)<br><br>These facts are very important for anyone who wants to attract insect-eating birds--and who among us does not--because their favorite insect foods are leaf-eaters. Once again, we're talking about basic ecology: read about the food chain in your ecology textbook.<br><br>An excellent and detailed introduction to this topic is <i>Bringing Nature Home</i>, by Douglas W. Tallamy. The author is an entomologist and provides many specific examples of the importance of natives in our landscapes. The book's details are specific to eastern North America--Tallamy teaches at the University of Delaware--so it would be less useful for those who live in other regions; the principles, if not the details, should hold anywhere, though.<br><br>Even the most intensively farmed plot of ground or suburban tract has room for a few native shrubs, small trees, and/or herbaceous perennials that are attractive to leaf-eaters.

And allowing, and indeed encouraging, them to take what's theirs is good for us all -- including the human members of this little local ecosystem.<br><br>Acting always on this rule saves an awful lot of futile effort trying to remove or prevent 'pests' (nasty, deceitful word to libel some of our fellow living beings!), and saves us from the constant unnecessary worry of even entertaining such a bad idea.<br><br>For example, I still have a modest population of slug and snail neighbours about.

On purpose.<br><br>One February, there was an unusual warm spell which woke a few bats. Two big browns scouted their way into the lower level of the natural history museum where I worked at the time. Specifically, they were fluttering around the mummy storage room. Gave the staff quite a start, as you might imagine.<br><br>Since there was little for bats to eat at that time of year, the local naturalist suggested they'd have a better chance of survival if we could put them back into hibernation right away and release them around the start of April. So we tucked each bat into a big empty pickle jar with air holes pounded in the lid. We stored them in the vegetable crisper drawer at the bottom of the fridge.<br><br>The story has a half-happy ending. I was able to revive one of the bats when the bugs started flying. He was hissing mad, but I safely placed him in our bat house (the first and only time it's been used--we've followed the recommendations for placement and still have trouble attracting bats, probably because there's not enough water in our neighborhood). He spent the afternoon and evening recovering in there, departing sometime during the night. The other bat had very little fat on him and never woke up.<br><br>I'm sure no one reading this will ever want to eat at our house now. ;-P<br><br>There are a lot of bumblebees visiting our yard this year. More than I've ever seen before. It's neat that hive boxes can be built for them. I had no idea. I'll have to watch them more carefully and see if I can follow where they go when they leave the flowers. I'd be curious to know where they've made their hive.<br><br>--<a href=http://www.linkedin.com/in/tracyglomski rel=nofollow>Tracy Glomski</a><br><br><a href=#c9135294581966026574 title="comment permalink">9/9/10, 2:56 PM</a><br><br>

Not unexpectedly, we host many nesting pairs of robins each spring. <br><br>Better yet, we have returning pairs of barn swallows and Eastern kingbirds, so the local mosquito population is held in check, which is vital here since we are a West Nile hot spot. This year I held up hay delivery because barn swallows nested in the hay shed.

What I mentioned were simply examples. <br><br>Gunnar, this is one of the reasons I don't favor importing worms from elsewhere. <br><br>DIYer, it's been a weird year. Our tomatoes, onions, beans and peas did very well, while some other crops didn't produce at all -- of course this is our first season here and we'll see how things go in the seasons to come. <br><br>Mary, climate change is certainly part of it; more broadly, a lot of ecosystems are becoming unstable for a whole slew of reasons. I'll be discussing that down the road. <br><br>Dalriada, that's wonderful to hear. I hadn't known about woodpecker nests as bat houses -- that may be a reason why we have lots of bats; we've got a green belt right next door, and plenty of woodpeckers and flickers in it. <br><br>Andy, an excellent point, which I'll include in the book. <br><br>Onion, thank you. That's worth knowing. <br><br>Michael, I prefer a lazy approach to gardening, and thus don't get aggressive about much of anything; I don't know if that helps the earthworms, but it certainly doesn't seem to hurt!<br><br>Dr. Beowulf, honeybees are unusual in the amount of distance they can cover; many wild bees have a much shorter range. Still, planting bee plants all over the place can't hurt!<br><br>Bill, thanks for the link! We have mostly swifts here, and enough that I haven't seen a point in putting in houses, but I'll check into their needs in case. <br><br>Joel, why do you think that? Just curious... <br><br>Robin, many thanks!<br><br><a href=#c6665895691091887970 title="comment permalink">9/9/10, 4:01 PM</a><br><br>

It would be a good research project. You can also find out what likes to eat them, and figure out how to boost the population of grasshopper predators. <br><br>Cherokee, exactly. The more diverse and complex an ecosystem is, besides, the more stable it is and the more easily it resists disruption. <br><br>Void, all good points. One of the drawbacks of the blog format is that there isn't really space to go into all the details. <br><br>Wendy, excellent. I'm also a big fan of fallen leaves -- it doesn't hurt that we've got a bunch of big maples next to our garden, so we get plenty. <br><br>Darius, I should probably make time to read those someday. <br><br>Andy, there's a book I read many years ago with the fine title <i>Butterflies In My Stomach: The Role of Insects in Human Nutrition</i>. As I recall, it had recipes for grasshopper.<br><br>Robo, that's par for the course these days, but it's still appalling. It's exactly this attitude of "all for us and nothing for other living things" that's landing us in a world of hurt. <br><br>Sgage, thank you for the recommendation! I'll take a look at it. <br><br>Tinfoil, garter snakes are also good grasshopper predators, as I recall. Might be worth studying the limiting factors for reptiles and amphibians generally. <br><br>Marielar, that's fascinating. I wasn't aware of that. <br><br>Claes, interesting. I wonder why it is, then, that so many neoclassical economists explicitly deny that Liebig's law applies to the relationship between human beings and natural resources. <br><br>Cathy, some people who do bumblebee boxes in wet climates dig them in right next to a house or shed, where they're sheltered from the rain by the roof overhang, and make sure the hose comes up in a high spot so water won't get into it. The bees seem content with that.<br><br><a href=#c1631850298657206323 title="comment permalink">9/9/10, 4:17 PM</a><br><br>

The virtue of generosity applies to nature as well as to our own species, and has the same payback. <br><br>Rita, "check before spreading anything" is good advice generally. <br><br>Farmer, don't grudge the birds their dinners. Thinking of "your" bees is exactly the mistake I was trying to critique; to begin with, they're nature's bees, not yours; and since birds don't take out whole hives, just individuals, they provide a useful service by taking the weak and sick individuals. <br><br>Don, yes, I saw that. Trolls will be trolls, I suppose, but it's astonishing what garbage people will make up when they can hide behind the protection of an internet alias. <br><br>Sekenre, I wish hedgehogs were native to this continent! A fine, harmless, and very useful mammal. <br><br>Tracy, that's a great story. Bats roused too early from hibernation rarely survive; you did well to save one. <br><br>Grrl, I've never heard of a cat catching a bat. I'm sure it must happen now and then, but it's very rare. Your senior cat will have to be truly mighty to bring one down!<br><br>Houyhnhnm, thank you for an inspiring account!

However, nature abhors a vacuum, sooner or later something will learn to eat it, and often not even that much time is required, as insects, bacteris and fungi evolve much quicker than larger life due to their short generational period.<br><br>Two hundred years ago peach trees, which are exotics in North America, spread so rapidly in the mid-atlantic that some worried areas were becoming a "wilderness of peach trees". Now, although you occasionally find a wild peach tree, it's not on anybody's list of invasives, and as anybody who grows them knows, they have plenty of natural enemies. The same for the rest of our common non-native food crops, they've got plenty of natural enemies. Some more unusual crops still don't, the jujube trees I've planted have so far lived up to their reputation as being pretty much pest-free, but I do wonder how long that will last, especially if they became more widely planted. After all, apples are exotics and they have a huge number of pests and diseases in North America, some of those are imports as well but many are natives that lived on related species and made the jump to apples.<br><br>I certainly wouldn't plant any of the real agressive invaders such as japanese stilt grass, oriental bittersweet or kudzu (or whatever the equivalents are in your area), however the majority of exotics are much more tame than that and if there's a good reason to include them in your plantings, I would do the research to see how aggressive they are but wouldn't stop just because they're exotic. I also am an advocate for planting native plants and conserving them too, I just don't believe the more extreme proclamations made about exotics, they are usually made from extrapolation of current trends, which don't go on forever. Also, Monsanto and other chemical companies like the more extreme ant-exotic people, herbicides are often used in the battles against exotics.<br><br><a href=#c7398779928676723947 title="comment permalink">9/9/10, 7:36 PM</a><br><br>

I was wondering the same thing – this year’s weird, cold spring must have knocked off a dozen species of plant and insect<br><br>One way to get around this is (if you have the space) to plant a large diversity of species. <br><br>Last year in our Spring, we had a 2 week heat wave through the middle of the major flowering period for the fruit trees. A lot of the blossoms fell of the trees as they went into shock. No blossoms = no fruit.<br><br>The early and late varieties cropped well, but the others... Oh well. <br><br>It was a bit of a drama too, because that Spring followed the previous summer where we had no rain for two months. The lack of rain didn't kill the fruit trees but they didn't produce enough new wood (which produces fruit the following season in a lot of cases).<br><br>I've also noticed that when you get a good year for yellow stone fruit, it's a bad one for the white stone fruit and vice versa.<br><br>I guess the summary is that variability in climate and conditions is the norm and not the exception.

I have a small, but slowly growing patch of a pretty native plant, pussytoe, growing in the yard. I've stopped mowing there so it's been able to flower and seed in peace the last couple of years. Well this summer, the most common butterfly around the garden has been a gorgeous little thing I managed to identify as a Pecks Skipper. And according to the field guide the larval foodplants for this skipper are everlastings and pussytoes. So for a few square feet of unmown lawn I get a nice population of beautiful and energetic pollinators. Those kinds of inter-relationships are happening invisibly all around, (and I believe, most intensely with the native plants and their co-evolved creatures).<br><br><a href=#c6405635775362905114 title="comment permalink">9/10/10, 3:31 AM</a><br><br>

The common reed grass of lake and pond shores, <i>Phragmites austrails</i>, a native of Europe, has been in North America for close to 400 years. In its homeland, some 170 species of insect dine on the leaves. Here in North America, after almost 400 years, only five native species of leaf-eating insects munch on the leaves.

Perhaps it has to do with how close relatives it has, peaches and apples for example both have many native relatives, if you know of any studies that go into that I would like to hear of them. As I stated before I do agree there are aggressive introduced species that are causing harm to natives (although in many instances there are human-caused environmental changes that are favoring those particular exotics, such as habitat fragmentaion, high deer density, absence of other large grazers, fire suppression, air pollution and nitrogen deposition, and increasingly now climate change).<br><br>However I have also seen people claim things that are exaggerations or plat out lies about exotics. When I lived in Minnesota European Buckthorn was one invasive, and although it's true that it does form dense thickets, I once saw a flier advocating buckthorn removal stating that buckthorn is fast growing, has no natural enemies, is drought reasistant, and nothing grows underneath it. In actuality, it's growth rate is moderate compared to many trees, I knew well an old field that was a 15-year-old young woods, where the tallest buckthorn was half as high as the tallest aspen, oak, walnut, and boxelder saplings. While it does likely have fewer natural enemies than most natives, the repeated assertion I saw that it has none was proven wrong by the orange spots that appeared every late spring/early summer on the leaves of many plants, obviously a fungal growth although I couldn't find out what. I also noticed one dry summer when certain stands had a lot of dieback, it was either the drought, an unknown natural enemy or a combination. Finally, I would like to show those who state nothing ever grows ungerenath it the dense healthy stands of native trout lilies under a buckthorn stand that was about as dense as they get. Similarly I'd seen sugar maple seedlings growing underneath such stands, and larger saplings growing right through the short buckthorn canopy. Also hackberries in some places although mot the densest stands. Most stands didn't have much else growing under them because they invaded what used to be more open woodlands or savannas before fire suppression and eradication of the herds of buffalo and elk. The deer don't like the buckthorn, and they're now often at much higher densities with regard to available habitat than historically, and they're eating many of the native plants even where there wasn't buckthorn.<br><br>Where I am now in the Missouri ozarks there are exotics around but at least where I am they tend to stick to at least somewhat disturbed areas.<br><br>continued<br><br><a href=#c7203870979841975443 title="comment permalink">9/10/10, 7:23 PM</a><br><br>

It seems to advocate the introduction of machinery, but many of the photos show horses at work.
