The uncontrolled simplification of a complex system is rarely a welcome event for those people whose lives depend on the system in question. That’s one way to summarize the impact of the waves of trouble rolling up against the sand castles we are pleased to call the world’s modern industrial nations. Exactly how the interaction between sand and tide will work out is anyone’s guess at this point; the forces that undergird that collision have filled the pages of this blog for a year and a half now; here, and for the next few posts, I want to talk a bit about what can be done to deal with the consequences.<br><br>That requires, first of all, recognizing what can’t be done. Plenty of people have argued that the only valid response to the rising spiral of crisis faced by industrial civilization is to build a completely new civilization from the ground up on more idealistic lines. Even if that latter phrase wasn’t a guarantee of disaster – if there’s one lesson history teaches, it’s that human societies are organic growths, and trying to invent one to fit some abstract idea of goodness is as foredoomed as trying to make an ecosystem do what human beings want – we no longer have time for grand schemes of that sort. To shift metaphors, when your ship has already hit the iceberg and the water’s coming in, it’s a bit too late to suggest that it should be rebuilt from the keel up according to some new scheme of naval engineering.<br><br>An even larger number of people have argued with equal zeal that the only valid response to the predicament of our time is to save the existing order of things, with whatever modest improvements the person in question happens to fancy, because the alternative is too horrible to contemplate. They might be right, too, if saving the existing order of things was possible, but it’s not. A global civilization that is utterly dependent for its survival on ever-expanding supplies of cheap abundant energy and a stable planetary biosphere is simply not going to make it in a world of ever-contracting supplies of scarce and expensive energy and a planetary biosphere that the civilization’s own activities are pushing into radical instability. Again, when your ship has already hit the iceberg and the water’s coming in, it’s not helpful to insist that the only option is to keep steaming toward a distant port.<br><br>What that leaves, to borrow a useful term from one of the most insightful books of the last round of energy crises, is muddling through. Warren Johnson’s <i>Muddling Toward Frugality</i> has fallen into the limbo our cultural memory reserves for failed prophecies; neither he nor, to be fair to him, anybody else in the sustainability movement of the Seventies had any idea that the collective response of most industrial nations to the approach of the limits to growth would turn out to be a thirty-year vacation from sanity in which short-term political gimmicks and the wildly extravagant drawdown of irreplaceable resources would be widely mistaken for permanent solutions. <br><br>That put paid to Johnson’s hope that simple, day by day adjustments to dwindling energy and resource supplies would cushion the transition from an economy of abundance to one of frugality. His strategy, though, still has some things going for it that no other available approach can match: It can still be applied this late in the game; if it’s done with enough enthusiasm or desperation, and with a clear sense of the nature of our predicament, it could still get a fair number of us through the mess ahead; and it certainly offers better odds than sitting on our hands and waiting for the ship to sink, which under one pretense or another is the other option open to us right now.<br><br>A strategy of muddling doesn’t lend itself to nice neat checklists of what to do and what to try, and so I won’t presume to offer a step-by-step plan. Still, showing one way to muddle, or to begin muddling, and outlining some of the implications of that choice, can bridge the gap between abstraction and action, and suggest ways that those who are about to muddle might approach the task – and of course there’s always the chance that the example might be applicable to some of the people who read it. With this in mind, I want to talk about victory gardens.<br><br>The victory garden as a social response to crisis was an invention of the twentieth century. Much before then, it would have been a waste of time to encourage civilians in time of war to dig up their back yards and put in vegetable gardens, because nearly everybody who had a back yard already had a kitchen garden in it. That was originally why houses had back yards; the household economy, which produced much of the goods and services used by people in pre-petroleum Europe and America, didn’t stop at the four walls of a house; garden beds, cold frames, and henhouses in urban back yards kept pantries full, while no self-respecting farm wife would have done without the vegetable garden out back and the dozen or so fruit trees close by the farmhouse.<br><br>Those useful habits only went into decline when rail transportation and the commercialization of urban food supplies gave birth to the modern city in the course of the nineteenth century. When 1914 came around and Europe blundered into the carnage of the First World War, the entire system had to be reinvented from scratch in many urban areas, since the transport networks that brought fresh food to the cities in peacetime had other things to do, and importing food from overseas became problematic for all the combatants in a time of naval blockades and unrestricted submarine warfare. The lessons learned from that experience became a standard part of military planning thereafter, and when the Second World War came, well-organized victory garden programs shifted into high gear, helping to take the hard edges off food rationing. It’s a measure of their success that despite the massive mismatch between Britain’s wartime population and its capacity to grow food, and the equally massive challenge of getting food imports through a gauntlet of U-boats, food shortages in Britain never reached the level of actual famine.<br><br>In the Seventies, in turn, the same thing happened on a smaller scale without government action; all over the industrial world, people who were worried about the future started digging victory gardens in their back yards, and books offering advice on backyard gardening became steady sellers. (Some of those are still in print today.) These days, sales figures in the home garden industry reliably jolt upwards whenever the economy turns south or something else sends fears about the future upwards; for many people, planting a victory garden has become a nearly instinctive response to troubled times.<br><br>It’s fashionable in some circles to dismiss this sort of thing as an irrelevance, but such analyses miss the point of the phenomenon. The reason that the victory garden has become a fixture of our collective response to trouble is that it engages one of the core features of the predicament individuals and families face in the twilight of the industrial age, the disconnection of the money economy from the actual production of goods and services – in the terms we’ve used here repeatedly, the gap between the tertiary economy on the one hand, and the primary and secondary economies on the other.<br><br>Right now, the current theoretical value of all the paper wealth in the world – counting everything from dollar bills in wallets to derivatives of derivatives of derivatives of fraudulent mortgage loans in bank vaults – is several orders of magnitude greater than the current value of all the actual goods and services in the world. Almost all of that paper wealth consists of debt in one form or another, and the mismatch between the scale of the debt and the much smaller scale of the global economy’s assets means exactly the same thing that the same mismatch would mean to a household: imminent bankruptcy. That can take place in two ways – either most of the debt will lose all its value by way of default, or all of the debt will lose most of its value by way of hyperinflation – or, more likely, by a ragged combination of the two, affecting different regions and economic sectors at different times.<br><br>What that implies for the not too distant future is that any economic activity that depends on money will face drastic uncertainties, instabilities, and risks. People use money because it gives them a way to exchange their labor for goods and services, and because it allows them to store value in a relatively stable and secure form. Both these, in turn, depend on the assumption that a dollar has the same value as any other dollar, and will have roughly the same value tomorrow that it does today.<br><br>The mismatch between money and the rest of economic life throws all these assumptions into question. Right now there are a great many dollars in the global economy that are no longer worth the same as any other dollar. Consider the trillions of dollars’ worth of essentially worthless real estate loans on the balance sheets of banks around the world. Governments allow banks to treat these as assets, but unless governments agree to take them, they can’t be exchanged for anything else, because nobody in his right mind would buy them for more than a tiny fraction of their theoretical value. Those dollars have the same sort of weird half-existence that horror fiction assigns to zombies and vampires; they’re undead money, lurking in the shadowy crypts of Goldman Sachs like so many brides of Dracula, because the broad daylight of the market would kill them at once.<br><br>It’s been popular for some years, since the sheer amount of undead money stalking the midnight streets of the world’s financial centers became impossible to ignore, to suggest that the entire system will come to a messy end soon in some fiscal equivalent of a zombie apocalypse movie. Still, the world’s governments are doing everything in their not inconsiderable power to keep that from happening. Letting banks meet capital requirements with technically worthless securities is only one of the maneuvers that government regulators around the world allow without blinking. Driving this spectacular lapse of fiscal probity, of course, is the awkward fact that governments – to say nothing of large majorities of the voters who elect them – have been propping up budgets for years with their own zombie hordes of undead money. <br><br>Underlying this awkward fact is the reality that the only response to the current economic crisis most governments can imagine involves churning out yet more undead money, in the form of an almost unimaginable torrent of debt; the only response most voters can imagine, in turn, involves finding yet more ways to spend more money than they happen to earn. So we’re all in this together; everybody insists that the walking corpses in the basement are fine upstanding citizens, and we all pretend not to notice that more and more people are having their necks bitten or their brains devoured. <br><br>As long as most people continue to play along, it’s entirely possible that things could stumble along this way for quite a while, with stock market crashes, sovereign debt crises, and corporate bankruptcies quickly covered up by further outpourings of unpayable debt. The problem for individuals and families, though, is that all this makes money increasingly difficult to use as a medium of exchange or a store of wealth. If hyperinflation turns out to be the mode of fiscal implosion du jour, it becomes annoying to have to sprint to the grocery store with your paycheck before the price of milk rises above $1 million a gallon; if we get deflationary contraction instead, business failures and plummeting wages make getting any paycheck at all increasingly challenging; in either case your pension, your savings, and the money you pour down the rathole of health insurance are as good as lost.<br><br>This is where victory gardens come in, because the value you get from a backyard garden differs from the value you get from your job or your savings in a crucial way: money doesn’t mediate between your labor and the results. If you save your own seeds, use your own muscles, and fertilize the soil with compost you make from kitchen and garden waste – and many gardeners do these things, of course – the only money your gardening requires of you is whatever you spend on beer after a hard day’s work. The vegetables that help feed your family are produced by the primary economy of sun and soil and the secondary economy of sweat; the tertiary economy has been cut out of the loop.<br><br>Now it will doubtless be objected that nobody can grow all the food for a family in an ordinary back yard, so the rest of the food remains hostage to the tertiary economy. This is more or less true, but it’s less important than it looks. Even in a really thumping depression, very few people have no access to money at all; the problem is much more often one of not having enough money to get everything you need by way of the tertiary economy. An effective response usually involves putting those things that can be done without money outside the reach of the tertiary economy, and prioritizing whatever money can be had for those uses that require it. <br><br>You’re not likely to be able to grow field crops in your back yard, for example, but grains, dried beans, and the like can be bought in bulk very cheaply. What can’t be bought cheaply, and in a time of financial chaos may not be for sale at all, are exactly the things you can most effectively grow in a backyard garden, the vegetables, vine and shrub fruits, eggs, chicken and rabbit meat, and the like that provide the vitamins, minerals, and nutrients you can’t get from fifty pound sacks of rice and beans. Those are the sorts of things people a century and a half ago produced in their kitchen gardens, along with medicinal herbs to treat illnesses and maybe a few dye plants for homespun fabric; those are the sorts of things that make sense to grow at home in a world where the economy won’t support the kind of abundance most people in the industrial world take for granted today.<br><br>It will also doubtless be objected that even if you reduce the amount of money you need for food, you still need money for other things, and so a victory garden isn’t an answer. This is true enough, if your definition of an answer requires that it simultaneously solves every aspect of the mess in which the predicament of industrial society has landed us. Still, one of the key points I’ve tried to make in this blog is that waiting for the one perfect answer to come around is a refined version of doing nothing while the water rises. Muddling requires many small adjustments rather than one grand plan: planting a victory garden in the back yard is one adjustment to the impact of a dysfunctional money economy on the far from minor issue of getting food on the table; other impacts will require other adjustments.<br><br>A third objection I expect to hear that not everybody can plant a victory garden in the back yard. A good many people don’t have back yards these days, and some of those who do are forbidden by restrictive covenants from using their yards as anything but props for their home’s largely imaginary resale value. (Will someone please explain to me why so many Americans, who claim to value freedom, willingly submit to the petty tyranny of planned developments and neighborhood associations? Brezhnev’s Russia placed fewer restrictions on people’s choices than many neighborhood covenants do.) The crucial point here is that a victory garden is simply an example of the way that people have muddled through hard times in the past, and might well muddle through the impending round of hard times in the future. If you can’t grow a garden in your backyard, see if there’s a neighborhood P-Patch program that will let garden somewhere else, or look for something else that will let you meet some of your own needs with your own labor without letting money get in the way.<br><br>That latter, of course, is the central point of this example. At a time when the tertiary economy is undergoing the first stages of an uncontrolled and challenging simplification, if you can disconnect something you need from the tertiary economy, you’ve insulated a part of your life from at least some of the impacts of the chaotic resolution of the mismatch between limitless paper wealth and the limited real wealth available to our species on this very finite planet. What garlic is to vampires and a well-fueled chainsaw is to zombies, being able to do things yourself, with the skills and resources you have on hand, is to the undead money lurching en masse through today’s economy; next week, we’ll replace the garlic with a mallet and a stake.

In reality most people lived suburban lives with big lawns and long commutes. The feed store closed in 2003 because there were not enough livestock left in the county to keep it in business. But shortly after that, things began a slow turnaround. Now gardens are once again ubiquitous, my roosters have neighbors in both directions to challenge in vocal competitions, and there are four stores to chose between when the critters get hungry. At the top of the hill, three adjacent residential lots have been bought up, consolidated, and converted into a pastured poultry + free range egg farm and family feed store. When fuel prices soared and financial markets tanked a few years ago, the Mall*Wart could hardly keep up with the demand for plants, seeds, and canning supplies. <br><br>This is all happening by "muddling through." People get worried, some suffer real hardships and setbacks, everyone sees it happening to someone nearby even if they themselves have remained fortunate, and they do something. The economy does not change because planners and dreamers and policy experts say it will. It changes in millions of conversations over millions of kitchen tables, each household unit figuring out what they think they oughta do, looking at what the neighbors are doing, listening to their own sources, coming to their own decisions, and revisiting the whole process as often as they feel is necessary.<br><br><a href=#c7489934623446560099 title="comment permalink">5/19/10, 8:27 PM</a><br><br>

My wife and I have started growing many of our own vegetables and herbs in both our front and back yards, where I've built several self-watering containers, raised beds with cold frames, etc. We've been getting roughly 2 - 3 crops per year out of each plot. It's not enough to feed ourselves (yet), but the education has been worth it. Compost bins? Worms? Been there, done that. And the hard work actually is more fun than going to the gym...<br><br>Since we've started this endeavor we've met more of our neighbors than in the years before we started gardening. Usually it starts out when someone drives by and asks, "Are those tomatoes?" One thing inevitably leads to another, and it turns out that a very large number of the people around here have the same idea, and are starting to grow at least some of their own food.<br><br>Only a few will come out and say why they are doing this at first, but it soon becomes apparent that we are all worried about just how unsustainable our whole system is. The other thing that lots of our neighbors are doing is stocking up on guns and ammo, you know, just in case...<br><br>Over on survivalblog.com there is a lot of discussion about various "end of the world as we know it" scenarios, and how to repel the "golden horde" of hungry refugees trying to escape from the major population centers. I don't think things will get THAT bad (at least I hope they don't), but it is obvious that our current system really is unsustainable, and some kind of very unpleasant crash is going to happen sooner or later. All we can do is try to prepare as best we can and ride out the hard times for as long as possible.<br><br>With any luck, our children will end up on a small, self-sufficient farmstead and pay taxes to the local warlord in the form of home-grown herbs and horses for the local mounted militia. We also know how to make gunpowder (the original formula), and electric-generating wind turbines (out of used 55-gal drums and alternators from junked cars). <br><br>A lot depends on what level of technology we can maintain after fossil fuels become more expensive, and the exact nature of the collapse of civilization as we knew it (and how many weapons of mass destruction get used during the collapse).<br><br>So, feudalism sounds okay to me, as long as we retain at least some of the scientific knowledge that has enabled us to increase our lifespans (we may go back to something resembling the middle ages, but unless there's a major nuclear war or similar disaster we're not going to lose the ability to generate electricity with wind turbines, or mine coal for our steam engines, or make paper and ink, or penicillin.<br><br>We have many friends who are science fiction fans or members of the SCA. Half of them want to live a hundred years from now, while the other half would just as soon go back a couple centuries. Almost no one really likes our life in the here and now. Life may be easy now, but it's too complex. I suspect that a good number of people would gladly trade that for a life that is hard but simple (I know, I know... in the middle ages most of us would have been landless serfs, so be careful what you wish for).

It's a great image and a very apt metaphor.<br><br>One telling fact about the current crisis, the FDIC is refusing to shut down insolvent banks. Under the statues as written, as soon as a bank fails to meet it's capital requirements, the FDIC is supposed to step in, take it over, and sell the assets. The depositors get a new bank that is fiscally solvent, and the FDIC only has to pay out a tiny bit, usually 1-2% of the total on deposit. <br><br>But with the new rules. the banks no longer have to value their capital assets at market value (the old mark-to-market rule). Instead, they can keep them on the books at face value, until they, in fact, completely fail.So the FDIC can't take over the bank until the damage is much greater. The typical bank closed by FDIC these days represents a cost to the FDIC of 40-50% of the total of deposits. This adds up to hundreds of billions so far, hundreds of billions more than FDIC has ever had. So far they've managed with loans from the US Treasury.<br><br>But Treasury funds must be borrowed from somewhere. and if that source of funds ever dries up, say goodbye to any money you have in an account.<br>Strangely, this is the first year in a long time that we have not had a garden. Too many other things, too urgent and too exhausting to devote any energy to a garden this year.<br><br>One good strategy for getting food is what I call foraging. If you look in a great many suburban and even urban front yards, you will see a 30 or 40 or 60 year-old fruit tree or two. Identify which owners do not use the fruit, and when harvest time comes around, offer to clean up the fruit for them. A great many will say no, for fear of liability, but some will say yes. And even windfalls make great cider. Other places, like RR right-of-ways, road sides, river banks, foreclosed properties, green belts, and odd undeveloped corners of housing developments will often have fruit trees as well. When we lived in Olympia, we put up 150 quarts of applesauce and dozens of quarts of plums, cherries and pears from such foraged fruit. Even today, with acreage to use, it makes no sense to plant blackberries, since the RR right-of-way a few hundred feet away is literally covered with them. Three years ago I put up enough jam that it still hasn't run out.<br><br><a href=#c7702314036168457800 title="comment permalink">5/20/10, 12:40 AM</a><br><br>

To think that just some of us "muddling through" is the best that we can do says nothing good about us as a species and a society. But, given my experiences of dealing with people and with our local government I think that it is wholly accurate.<br><br>It is virtually impossible to disconnect from the economy in this day and age. There are always bills to pay, even if they are just land taxes. It is ironic that to really disconnect, what you need is lots of money. I expect you can see the irony.<br><br>So muddling through it is, with the full expectation that not everyone will survive and that things won't ever be the same and will certainly be a lot harder.<br><br><br>Over the last couple of weeks I have been thinking and reading about methane production. I can see a clear path to improving the land in our area (by removing the pervasive weed species on farm land and in the bush) and using the waste to create fertiliser and a renewable energy source that could be used to power modest vehicles, provide refrigeration, generate electricity, cook and other things that we can't readily get from low grade energy sources like the sun. It could easily be done with simple tools and a net positive energy return (in my area at least).<br><br>You could only provide modest resources though for a fraction of the local population (and this is not a densely populated area). <br><br>But if you want to do it for any significant number of people right now it requires that you engage with the economy (with all of its attendant risks and problems). If you leave it until things start to fail then it may not even be possible. <br><br>So once again we are left with muddling through. I will probably build my own modest system and leave it at that, because doing anything more means fighting the very, very strong current of a society that is too stupid, or two scared to face the consequences of its actions.<br><br>We Muddled through.

Maybe not the zombies in John Carpenter's remake of the classic George Romero film "Dawn of the Dead" though. That film scared me. Not much stopped the fast moving zombies, even the credits at the end showed the futility of trying to run. <br><br>Mind you chainsaws are pretty handy tools when you are up in a forest. Not many people realise how much and how quickly you can get through cutting tasks with them. Chainsaws haven't been around that long really and they are an awesome bit of engineering. Forestry work before this involved two man cross cut saws, planks high off the ground, mallets, chocks and axes. Hard work and we're surrounded by hardwood trees, not softwoods like you find in the Northern Hemisphere.<br><br>I've worked with businesses for the past two decades. Early on I used to personally take on board their problems (which were mostly of their own making) and work hard at trying to provide solutions and support the existing arrangements. After a few years and much stress I worked out that this approach was pretty much a waste of time. The best answer is that sometimes things have to fail completely before real change can occur. The difficulty is surviving any such change and ensuring that you are around to assist the now willing participants to engage in some sort of future. This is probably one of the key strengths in the Druid movement (which I am not a member of) and this blog.<br><br>Victory gardens are an awesome idea. Food = Oil and Oil = Food. There is no getting around this weakness in our system. The extraction, transport and application of superphosphates is a disaster waiting to happen as both oil and superphosphates are nearing or at their peak (superphosphates are predicted to peak in the next decade or so). Our entire food supply relies on both of these products and as they peak, so to will the price of food. There are no replacement products waiting in the wings for either of these two.<br><br>I'd encourage anyone to start planting fruit trees as they can take between 5 and 10 years to produce fruit. Vegetables with the right soil and conditions can produce results in two months or more which is not much good if you are hungry. Keep the seed too and propagate it!<br><br>I'd also encourage anyone to build up the organic matter in their soil through composts and mulches as these are fairly abundant at present and also fairly cheap as they are viewed in general as a waste product, which they are not.<br><br>The really good outcome from smaller scale farming is that you get the opportunity to close and/or improve the nutrient cycle which is currently very broken in Western societies. <br><br>Production of fruit and vegetables can be analogous to a rechargeable battery. The soil represents the battery and the organic nutrients that are applied increase the level of charge in that battery. Sending meat, fruit and vegetables away from the area that they are produced in draws down on the charge of the battery. Eventually if you send off more produce than what you bring in or create (green manures etc) then the battery gets run down and there are diminishing returns. Superphosphates are like a quick recharge except that it is short term, requires more product every year and you more or less damage the battery structure so that each year you get diminishing returns. Not a good basis for our industrial food production system.<br><br>When you drink a coffee where the beans have come from Indonesia and the milk from New Zealand, you are actually consuming nutrients from that country and exporting them to wherever they end up. Probably somewhere in your local sewerage system which they are not much use to anyone...<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><a href=#c1125537030612030894 title="comment permalink">5/20/10, 2:56 AM</a><br><br>

Been there, done that.<br><br>The issue is status symbolism. The restrictions are acceptable, because they keep the "riffraff" out. You create an illusion of affluence and power, by creating a place where there are no poor, or other undesirables. Part of the allure is property values, of course, but also a personal identification with the neighborhood (I hesitate to use the word "community", though that often develops, too). The homeowners association is an outgrowth of the "exclusive" country club.<br><br>About the victory gardens - I just picked up a library copy of "The New Square Foot Garden". Sharon Astyk recommended this with about a half-dozen other great books for new gardeners. SFG is kind of exciting to read, and seems to make sense. It relies on compost and sensible practices, rather than a heavy reliance on (unsustainable) fertilizers and pesticides.<br><br>I have to confess ignorance, though - what were you referring to as "shrub and vine fruits". I know I bought a bunch of grapes for a (hot) afternoon snack the other day - and spent more than for lunch. I live in a mostly-farming area, and I understand grapes, especially are intolerant of 2,4 D applied within a mile or more.

The medievals banned usury; in the early 20th century Gesell showed how to make money unattractive and Keynes, how to control it; James Robertson and others showed c.2000 how the current problems can be largely resolved if Governments simply take back their responsibility for creating money, which crooked bankers long ago usurped.

And although it might seem you are “preaching to the choir” with this post, as a relatively recent reader, I can assure you that newcomers are finding the site and appreciate the basics! Thanks for the mention of “Muddling..” I will have to check that one out. And undead money is a great concept – I’m appalled at how comfortable most people have gotten about debt in just this last generation – my grandparents refused to fall victim to it; my parents were ashamed… but this generation almost seems proud. Another example of how “doublespeak” has convinced some that black is white?<br><br>I confess it feels good to read about others who share my dislike/suspicion of the “overhead” and disconnect this culture has built up. I’ve been interested in getting back to the simple connection of food/shelter/basic living for probably 30 years, though I’ve only really gotten close these last three. I wonder if this “second wave” of backyard gardening has started to include some of those who don’t have a natural affinity (I’ve loved gardening since I was a child, and probably most of those on this site have, too). I can’t seem to say anything to get through to my suburbanite friends, but my actions (my blooming garden, my slower, nature-based lifestyle) seem to be causing them some envy, and some thought of copying me… that’s wonderful! And once this chicken coop is done (it’s got 4 walls &amp; a roof – just the hen door needed! Yeah!), I will have even more of the natural cycle working. I am learning to save seeds (a really excellent lesson in paying attention to detail) and have begun to feel like my life is more of a whole.<br><br>One idea I had, building on the victory gardens, that might become a niche job: designing flexible weather-modifiers. I’m staring out at yet another day of rain in the Willamette Valley, as neighbors tell me this is “unusually wet &amp; chilly” (for the 3rd year running!) and my veggies struggle to get enough warmth and dry. But just after I tuck plastic “rooms” around the most fragile, a couple of 70 degree sunny days come by and threaten to fry the protected plants. My point is, with global warming (global “weirding”) it could be a profitable job to design something to help backyard gardeners cope with the sudden shifts in weather (I fear for the field farmers, but that’s another post.)<br><br>Another niche job would be retrofitting apartment houses with the ability to grow food – either balcony &amp; roof gardens, or somehow attached vertically to walls around windows (outside) such that they could be tended from inside… anything to allow more people to access food.<br><br>Also, in the suggestion to plant fruit trees, don’t overlook bushes – I have boysenberries, raspberries and some blueberries along w/my apples – they start producing fairly quickly, and I’ve canned many jars. <br><br>@x2fer: I saw that news item in the Register Guard (I live a hour north of that area) and was appalled! How could your region (of all places!!) drop the extension service? That was very worrisome, and yet it brought home to me the dysfunctional pattern of modern “services”: move the expertise under “one roof” for efficiency (ie: put all your eggs in one basket) and then, as it grows, add more expensive bureaucracy until it finally collapses. That has happened in more areas of society recently, and brings home (to me) the fact that sharing expertise among neighbors doesn’t require any of that overhead (true, you aren’t protected by insurance; you haven’t done background checks)… but our Western culture’s desire for “efficiency” blinds us to the actual advantages of informal training.<br><br><a href=#c7627496917515003129 title="comment permalink">5/20/10, 8:29 AM</a><br><br>

This was because that we realize the impossibility of growing all of our own food on our small household plot and we would need further income to supply use with basic necessities. We discussed some occupations that were common 60-100 years ago that are extinct now that will be needed when our disposable economy dies. These included door to door knife and tool sharpeners, repair men for electronic devices, people who can sew and mend (this wasn’t an occupation per say but now this skill is rare in our society) clothing to name a few. <br>While we would like to relocate to a small farm in Vermont of New Hampshire we are preparing to live where we are in case the move appears to be impossible or our opportunity to move comes too late. It is ironic that we live in a town that was founded for and anchored by a textile mill for over 160 years. The mill closed in 2006 and is being torn down now, but in 10 more years it would be profitable again as the outsourcing of production comes to an end.<br><br><a href=#c383475578064956555 title="comment permalink">5/20/10, 9:35 AM</a><br><br>

Johnson's book has been a source of inspiration and ideas for me since I first got a copy back in the very early 1980s. <br><br>Sofistek, true, but energy's the gateway resource; if you have enough of it, you can extract the rest from even very sparse ores, while if you don't have enough, if doesn't matter how many other resources you have. <br><br>x2fer, organize the Master Gardeners, Composters, and Food Preservers as a volunteer organization with modest annual membership fees.

There's not going to be a horde, by the way; the cities will be where the jobs are as long as there are jobs anywhere, and as things get tight you'll see migration toward the cities, not away from them, just as happened in the former Soviet Union when it had its collapse. <br><br>Kevin, get brewing! Anybody who can brew good beer can expect to be revered as a minor deity in the far future. As for utopias, one of the very first articles I ever published was a piece in the now-defunct esoteric annual <i>Alexandria</i> critiquing the entire concept of utopia; that's been a consistent theme in my writing all along. <br><br>Danby, foraging is good!

Methane's a viable option; check into the very simple and effective methane digester designs that were worked up in the early 1970s. Livestock farms make it especially easy, and you can always compost the remaining sludge and use it as a first-rate soil amendment. <br><br>Joy, now that's funny.

Horse manure does wonders for the soil, introducing both organic matter and other nutrients most often depleted in modern agricultural practices. Healthy horses contribute at a rate of forty pounds a day, including urine! Most of that largesse will be spread out on pastures but some of it will be composted for gardening as long as I can assure myself it hasn't got the new weed killer Monsanto has devised for pastures and hayfields sprayed on it. (Warning, the stuff has been known to kill gardens even after going through the horse and composting for a year! And of course, Monsanto denies this happening.)<br><br>I read in a lot of these replies where people want to enrich their soil and I'd like to suggest an ancient S. American technique. Introduce charcoal into your soil. DO NOT buy commercial charcoal meant for your grill! Pile slash from tree cuttings up to 3" in diameter in a windrow in the area you want to enrich and light it off. Let it burn until the smoke becomes clean then smother it with soil as it completes the process to charcoal. Then and only then put the fire out completely. Afterward plow or dig the charcoal into your soil. <br><br>The charcoal regulates the absorption from top dressings and your own amendments into the soil and at the same time provides a home for what is normally short lived organisms from compost piles that are very beneficial for your garden. <br><br>You do not have to do this every year. Indeed, the S. A. tribe that practiced this technique died out over 500 years ago during the time of the conquest of the Americas from plague brought by the conquistadors without ever seeing a white man. Their plots of land are as fertile today as if they were farmed by them just last year! You can see if Mother Earth News has the article on their website, otherwise it was published last spring, (and I can't find my copy)!<br><br>Once on the land I plan on enriching as many of my pastures as I can in this matter.

Then, when somebody invades the land that will become your demesne, you put them to the sword. The local farmers decide, or are convinced by your men-at-arms, that being under your protection is worth a share of the food they grow and some labor in the off season to build you a castle.

And in a lot of places it has kind of turned upside down; most of the urban middle class home fermentors I know make beer (or mead), most of the country people I know make wine. Poor country folk have been making their own wines from anything and everything under the sun for century upon century. Passable wine is actually easier to make at home than beer, and when it fails often what you have is vinegar that can still be used in the kitchen. Even when it works it tends to be far on the dry side; I finally learned the deep dark secret of professional wine makers that the only way they make sweet wines is to ultrafilter the finished wine to get rid of the yeast then dump a bunch of sugar in it! Which leads to the big "But"...<br><br>Most "country wine" recipes call for a LOT of added sugar. This is not generally something that it is easy for a homesteader to grow and process for themselves. You can use homegrown substitutes like sorghum or honey, but those take a fair amount of work to produce. But sugar is the only ingredient you will likely have to buy; you can get by with a pinch of bread yeast or even take your chances with the natural wild yeasts that live on the fruit. Elderflowers are a well-known source for a fairly reliable wild yeast around here; in fact you can make a mildly alcoholic cross between "Mountain Dew" and champagne with elderflowers, lemon juice, sugar or honey, and a few weeks of fermentation time.<br><br><a href=#c4142262420826414579 title="comment permalink">5/20/10, 3:11 PM</a><br><br>

There's a common thread amongst neopagans, greenies, neo- and paleohippies, etc. to express great reverence for the idea of nature, but not be on such familiar terms with the reality of nature. If I hear one more "nature-worshiper" complain about rain I'll scream (actually, I have screamed that scream SOOO many times...). We had a small but lively discussion last weekend (in the rain...) about essentially the idea of connecting to the whole (gaia, nature, the interconnected global ecosystem, chose your terminology) via connection to place. So many of these "nature-focused" people couldn't tell you what trees grown in their front yard, when the apples blossom, or whether they live in or near a floodplain. Gardening is one part of this connecting to place; and since all places are interconnected when you connect to one you connect to all. <br><br>I had never heard the term "peak oil" before I started rearranging life so as to be more directly connected with my food chain (and hydrologic cycle). I have been gardening ever since I had a plot of dirt to do it in. As I detailed in the post linked in the sidebar of my own blog, it had to do with chickens and potatoes, not global petroleum production. Of course, the choices I made with that goal also happen to put me in a better position if the global transportation and agricultural systems begin to falter from petroleum shortages; but that's not the prime motivator.<br><br><a href=#c3700984345938586566 title="comment permalink">5/20/10, 3:52 PM</a><br><br>

Then, as now, the force that kept feudalism going was the interchange of leadership, marketing, risk management, and . . protecting serfs from interference by outside authorities. I see no reason to think that force would be necessary, or prudent, to establish or maintain a modern feudal arrangement. Force might be applied to assure security of the area held, or to address breaches of the peace. And, against tyranny, uprisings, yada, yada.<br><br>We aren't that far from the days of widespread sharecropping, one version of feudalism and something that might be considered. Say you have a farmer with a section of ground, 640 acres per each square mile section, that decides to go all feudal. Assume free and clear ownership of the land, but a realization that between Monsanto seed corn prices, lack of credit available at the bank, and a dirt-cheap sale at the local mobile home lot, said land owner decides he/she is really, really angry with the US government and the IRS. So.<br><br>Mr. F divides his property into 10 acre parcels. He hires a gaggle of high schoolers to build fences, move in a mobile home on each lot, rig out with water and sewer, maybe every 5th lot is divided into a store, stable, and craft shop and extra homes. Then lets folk know - they can live on his place, "Mr. F's Place" if they agree to perform an average of 4 hours of work for Mr. F, if they abstain from personal debt, maintain the condition of their assigned lot. The work for Mr. F could be raising crops, working at a craft, etc. And register with the IRS as dependents of Mr. F.<br><br>And you have feudalism. An overlord, with responsibilities to higher government, shielding pledged folk from interference. All within the current legal structure, and ready to weather the economic decline. Think community stables, at least at first, as new owners learn horsemanship and other agrarian arts. There would be room for merchants, for storing and distributing food for Mr. F and excess from gardens for the henchpeople. Maybe work out other arrangements for craftspeople, servants, etc. Mr. F could provide some hand tools for gardens to start, and assist with materials to build fences and outbuildings for tenants as time goes by.<br><br>A beer brewer would be good, but think, too, that there was a lot of reliance on taverns and inns. Every community has to have a way to extract assets from passersby - selling food, drink, and lodging is one of the many honorable ways.<br><br>Another older tradition was oral historian and storyteller, if there is a difference. Another is the putting to rhyme and song the events of the day - bardic or minstrel style. Long after the charge is gone for the MP3 player, a lowly recorder, guitar, piano, or accordion will still recall the days of Weird Al Yankovic, Julie Brown, Bob Wills, Ludwig Von Beethoven, Ringo Starr, Robert Palmer, Lawrence Welk, and Debbie Harry.<br><br><a href=#c5909502100649149928 title="comment permalink">5/20/10, 5:07 PM</a><br><br>

I hope to do the same on my family farm beginning next year.

I can't give a link to a specific example, but I have heard of a number of people in urban areas vegetable farming on other peoples yards in exchange for some of the produce.

As JMG says, one can in many places, including Washington State, you can gain possession of a piece of property by simply living there. This was originally part of English common law. The purpose is to prevent the heir of some previous owner showing up and suing for title based on a claim so old that it is impossible to adjudicate. Originally the period was based on the reign of the king. A claim from more than 2 kings previous (more or less) was disallowed. Think of it as a statue of limitations for real estate title claims. <br>In modern use, it's most often invoked in property line disputes. One of my teachers in high school was sued by their neighbor when he found that their house was 6 feet over the property line. Their defense was adverse possession, in that they had lived in that house for 12 years and it was to late to try to make them move it.<br><br>The terms and specifics vary between jurisdictions. Try looking up your state's statue of limitations for more information. Typically it requires having actual possession of the property, in an open and obvious manner, to the exclusion of the actual land owner. In some places, the squatter must be notorious, that is the legal owner of the property is must know, or the knowledge of the matter must be so common that he ought to know. <br>The exclusivity clause means that if you are paying rent, or otherwise staying there at the permission of the legal owner, you do not qualify for adverse possession. Essentially you must be trespassing. So if you expect the bank to ignore you for another 5 or 7 or 10 years (whatever it is in your area), then the way to establish adverse possession is to stop paying rent. But see an attorney first.<br><br><a href=#c542183385717180465 title="comment permalink">5/20/10, 6:23 PM</a><br><br>

That's not my position really. I pointed out the clear necessary physical causes for our whole system approaching a perfect impasse over 30 years ago. <br><br>What I'm "assuming" is that like many many other kinds of natural systems caught with a systematic growth process approaching a hazard of coming apart at its limits, we could make the jump to a new form. I think we could copy the key parts of what a spring shoot does at the end of its seed energy. It's much the same thing an infant in the womb does at the end of it's welcome inside it's mother. <br> <br>They "get the signal". They respond by letting go of their growth imperative. That switches them from looking for ways to complicate their needs to simplifying them. Converting a global system from complicating its needs to simplifying them is perhaps audacious, OK, but the model is there and it's the actual practical thing to do. There does seem to be a fairly clear impasse for anything else, at least. <br><br>Haven't we always wondered what technique nature used to make complex things simple? We see it all the time, making it one of the most common physical phenomena anyone observes. Because it appears to work by things changing their own internal rules as they go, people may have not been interested in it. It doesn't follow deterministic rules, but opportunistic ones, so our search for the prior rules for it always comes up empty. To me, that itself is solid scientific evidence that asking our standard question for how it works is asking the wrong question.<br><br>I do agree with you, though, about "people who are prepared to deal with radical simplification are going to be in much better shape". The first rule of being prepared for change, though, is paying attention and being creative in discovering what your options are for connecting with others in new ways. That means noticing what other things in your environment are doing, that you might never have noticed before. So I'd add "smelling the new roses" wherever they might be coming from, in addition to trying you hand at growing new varieties yourself.<br><br>So, if the rule is to find new ones, perhaps that starts with finding how to turn off what makes growth imperative, and then looking for new rules of the road that are going to fit together. We'll never be self-sufficient, or outgrow our need for complementary differences, I believe.<br><br><a href=#c4039395911125465801 title="comment permalink">5/20/10, 7:18 PM</a><br><br>

Colorado House Bill 1270 took effect August 6, 2008. According to KUSA, this allows "homeowners living in covenant controlled communities . . . to install energy saving devises such as evaporative coolers, wind-electric generators and clothes lines."

The areas where wine grapes may successfully be grown has been expanding because of breeding efforts. The University of Minnesota, for example, has been crossing wine grapes with native strains that can survive temperatures of -40. Wine grapes are currently being grown successfully in such unlikely places as Nebraska, Quebec, and Nova Scotia.<br><br>Regarding restrictive covenants, I think we can safely ignore most of them in our neighborhood. We don't have anyone policing the neighborhood looking out for violations, so someone would have to complain before anything would be done. Our next door neighbor, for example, has a backyard fence that doesn't conform. But nobody is complaining and I certainly won't be. If any of my neighbors don't like my dandelion-infested lawn, none have said anything to me. I've got my victory garden in the back; our neighbors across the street also have a vegetable patch.

I like both, and I try to patronize the local brewers as well as local wines.<br><br>The need to add sugar to make wine from most fruits is the big reason grapes have always been the preferred fruit for wine. Of all fruits, only grapes are capable of developing the level of sugar needed to ferment a stable wine. Grapes also have more moderate acid levels; other fruits have to be manipulated (usually by adding water and, of course, more sugar) to reduce their acidity.<br>(Partial disclaimer: not all native North American grape varieties, cultivated mostly in the eastern part of the continent, are capable of developing the requisite sugar/acid balance for wine and have to be treated the same as other fruits.)<br><br>One of the things I want to write about is how in Europe, it's the local wine that is most highly prized. This is because the local wine, coming from the same combination of soil and sun as the local food, is most perfectly matched to the local cuisine. Here, of course, we haven't really developed much in the way of local cuisines; most of our cuisines are imported. For that and other reasons I hope to discuss, we, especially in the eastern parts of North America, have a tendency to prefer the exotic wines and ignore the local wines.<br><br><a href=#c7808548242590011641 title="comment permalink">5/21/10, 5:06 AM</a><br><br>

An avid reader of your blog for 18 months, I decided to transform my .45 acre suburban lot into a minifarm. Miraculously, I live in such an old neighborhood, there were no ordinances against farm animals. <br><br>The fencing of the back third of the yard was the most challenging task. I did it myself. My two new MiniLaMancha goats are happily ensconced there, and the neighbors better not complain as they are far less noisy than a leaf blower. <br><br>An experiment with rooftop gardens led to a beehive, sun hungry herb, and flowers, watered with a drip irrigation system, on the porch room roof (it also inspired my son to plant a container garden on top of his row home in Philadelphia- he gave me fresh lettuce for Mother's Day). <br><br>A Drexel University student whose parents are farmers in Arkansas was so starved for working in the dirt, he help me design and plant 8 raised beds of vegetables and herbs. <br><br>Working full time and managing to finish the project was admittedly a feat. 8 hours a day of hard labor on the weekend was challenging for a sixty year old. I got used to it. <br><br>If I run out of money, I look forward to goat milk, cheese, honey, mead, and lots of fresh and canned veggies to supplement my 50 lb bags of beans and rice. <br><br>I suspect that the mead will be a popular item for bartering (my thanks to Dmitry Orlov for that inspiration).<br><br><a href=#c5520476942725078798 title="comment permalink">5/21/10, 12:58 PM</a><br><br>

I think it was in the fourteenth century that one of the major French barons was told that he had to produce paperwork justifying his ownership of some large chunk of property. The "charter" he flung down on the table was an ancient sword. That's the foundation of feudalism; the same scene might have taken place in Tokugawa Japan, or any other late feudal society. <br><br>Andrew, that's an excellent idea. <br><br>Danby, thanks for the details!<br><br>Phil, whether we're in a position to jump to a novel form of social organization is an interesting question. My sense is that that's not a productive way of looking at our situation. Rather, we're at a fairly well defined point in a known historical process, the decline and fall of a civilization; the growth imperative that industrial civilization shares with many others leads, not to some new achievement, but to disintegration and contraction.

You're right that municipal governments have a better chance of getting a clue than most others -- and it's good to hear of one that's starting to do something useful. <br><br>Don, that's interesting.

We all have to put fencing up around our gardens to keep out the javelinas (wild pigs), and build "bathtubs" of wire mesh underneath our raised beds to deter the gophers who have built a huge network of tunnels under the whole neighborhood (we call 'em the Viet Cong). <br><br>Cathy McGuire: go for it. My initial efforts at building cold frames and removable row covers for my own garden beds has resulted in the beginnings of a cash-only side job building these structures for other people. They are very simple: PVC pipe plus wire mesh plus shade cloth for summer or clear plastic sheeting for winter. My wife is pimping me out to all the little old widows in the neighborhood to work on their gardens (they call me Manuel, as in manuel labor...).<br><br>BTW, my wife works for a local stock broker. Recently they were on a conference call with one of their investment houses in New York. After listening to investment advice from the "gurus"<br>(mostly along the lines of things to avoid, like municipal bonds and commercial real estate), somebody asked, "So, what are you guys on Wall Street investing in for yourselves, personally? Gold?"<br><br>After what my wife described as a pregnant pause, one of the Wall Street guys, a prominent hedge fund manager, said, "We're buying arable farm land as far away from the city as possible." <br><br>Well, on that note, have a nice day!<br><br>Can you say "survival retreat?" I knew you could. We immediately went to our local gun store and bought another couple boxes of ammo.

I intend to look for some Wisecamp type Quarter horses possibly over in Elko Nev. at the Cowboy Poetry event. That's also when ranchers bring their extra horses in for a sale.

And learn how to use 'em and keep 'em sharp. Makes killing trees a bit more human scale.

When I started my own large garden in the 1970's I was torn between the advice of Rodale and Crockett. To use diazinon on the radishes or not? I decided to go the organic route and I think it turned out to be the right choice.<br>My daughter has a victory garden in a nice suburb outside of Boston. This garden area has been in use for decades. Some people use pesticides, some don't, some clean up their gardens, some don't. As a result the pressure from pests and fungi is quite overwhelming. <br>As a result the gardeners tempted to go to the local oh-so-green garden center and buy some sort of spray. This is really scary because many of those sprays contain a neoniticinoid substance, such as "imidicloprid" that has been banned in France and is suspected of being highly toxic to pollinators. It is notably less toxic to humans than the stuff that Jim Crockett recommended 30 years ago on public tv (lindane,) but it really sterilizes the soil that it touches. Everything dies, including worms.<br>I worry that, as my neighbors plow up their lawns and try to grow food for the first time they will begin to spray this stuff around. There are no warnings on the labels and garden supply clerks are clueless. Also, the manufacturer is Bayer Crop Science so you can imagine the resistance to any warnings. <br>Please, victory gardeners, help to spread the word so that we can retain our honeybees and native pollinators!

An isolated farmstead off by itself is a tempting target for raiders.<br><br>Francis, you may be right -- the Pacific Northwest grows world-class hops (though its wineries are pretty good, too). As for HOAs, the problem is that most people haven't yet grasped that their houses have no resale value worth speaking of, and are still clutching at the fantasy of pulling cash out of their homes to dodge the poverty that I think most of us know is coming. Anything that threatens that fantasy gets voted down in a hurry. <br><br>Phil, nah, it's not a matter of conceptual change, simply of the best available descriptor for a process rooted in the physical but embracing social, psychological, and spiritual dimensions. As for the global economy, it's already collapsing, and in conjunction with the end of the age of cheap energy and the massive impact of the limits to growth, it's eventually going to take computers and most of the rest of contemporary technology with it. That's my take, at least, and the question I'm trying to explore at this point is what can be done to save as much as possible from the long ragged descent that will land our great-grandchildren in the coming dark age. The whole system costs of maintaining computer technology keep them off the list; I'd like to see the scientific method, for example, get on it. <br><br>Apple Jack, that's certainly one way to do it. I'd encourage you to look at shifting down to one income as soon as circumstances permit, so that the other member of the couple can start working full time on the land. <br><br>Girl, definitely look for a unicorn! Breed it with your mares, and I promise you you'll have the most unique line of horses around. ;-)<br><br>Jim, as you network with other people who are getting into home gardening and food production, consider lobbying the county to allow up to 4 hens on a small lot. That's not uncommon, and you may be able to get a revision of the county regulations. <br><br>Jason, it's also happening outside of the Transition Towns movement, of course. <br><br>Don, that's worth knowing. Our home is on a hill overlooking the Potomac with southern and western exposure and plenty of fresh air; we may try planting some. <br><br>Edde, for obvious reasons, I don't encourage people to engage in illegal activities. I don't use that stuff myself, either, so it wouldn't be of much use to me. <br><br>Wordek, the problem there is that the number one lesson taught by planned societies is that planned societies are a bad idea, and I think we've had as many examples as we need!<br><br>Lynn, very well put. If you have to resort to sprays of any kind, even allegedly green ones, you're doing something wrong; I use very mild soap sprays at most, and have never had to go beyond that, because I put a lot of effort into building the soil, companion planting, and other chemical-free preventive measures. Poisons are never a good solution!<br><br>Steve, excellent. The more people pay attention to miracles of that kind, the better. <br><br>Ezab, thanks for the suggestions!

For example, food is generally much fresher and has fewer unpronounceable ingredients in it, and is likely to be healthier for people to eat. Clothing produced at home may not be deemed "high fashion" but it is generally sturdier and lasts longer, if not for the reason that it is likely to be made with more durable materials and a greater attention to construction and finishing, but also because the person wearing it knows intimately how much labor went into creating it and as a result will often take better care of it! <br><br>So I believe that while the products of the household economy on the surface may appear "less efficient" than those available in the global corporate marketplace, they often are made from locally obtained materials, are generally constructed to last longer and, in the end, may in fact be a far sight MORE sustainable and "efficient" than something mass produced and designed from the get-go for a short term of service and fast obsolescence and replacement.<br><br><a href=#c5707806620029682125 title="comment permalink">5/22/10, 12:53 PM</a><br><br>

Its certainly standard practice on sheep'n'beef units. Also adding an active and resting rotation helps as well. 70 or 80 days rest will mean that a lot of parasites will go through the freeliving part of their lifecycle without finding new host to reinfect. It also allows the pasture to grow longer so stock are less likely to pick up a parasite when you open it back up for grazing.

They show a quiet scene of the place and mention 'It is mid-day so the only sound heard is children playing because all of the adults are asleep during the hottest portion of the day' and also show a scene of children helping to load a cart to near overflowing with enormous cabbage (which they mention the constant hard work that goes into keeping them growing there) then they show the scene which sticks out in my mind at this moment; the market. It is rows and rows of farmer's carts laden with their produce which they sold as they pleased. I believe that farmer's markets may be beta-testing their Return to the long destitute desert-like social ecosystem of the so called 'modern' nations but in those places where they were not driven out to help the rich become richer some of them have stood for literally thousands of years and are hardly as a whole in beta testing. Please forgive the length of my comment but as I work as a programmer (quite by astronomical chance rather than design of my own), and I enjoy the open source and Unix approaches to what I do (I'm the only person on my team who does), I would like to draw a parallel: to say that a farmer's market is an idea to be beta tested in our society may be true in the way that Vim, Emacs, Open-Office, php, python, Apache, or even the old Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister (PERL: after ten years of use in the *nix world made available to people who wanted to employ the resource but were trapped in windows as the environment to do so) had to be beta-tested for their ports made compatible with microsoft's environment.<br><br><a href=#c3208839462538350726 title="comment permalink">5/24/10, 7:04 AM</a><br><br>

Much, if not most, of the textiles consumed in this country, for example, are being fabricated overseas. Sometimes it's just the fiber from the US that is sent overseas for milling and weaving into fabric, but as far as I know, very little of what goes into our clothing is being produced stateside anymore. Check the labels on most of what you wear and you'll probably be surprised. Shoes, too. If (when) overseas shipping and trade breaks down, we're likely going to have a problem keeping folks properly clothed and shod after a while, especially since much of what is available in the stores is of such poor quality and utility these days. <br><br>Around here, there are two sources of fiber that I know of - wool, and wild flax. For this reason a couple of years ago I taught myself to spin on a drop spindle. I got to the point where I could spin fine laceweight yarn on it, and for a drop spindle spinner I was actually pretty quick with it - but since drop spindle spinning isn't a fast process by any means that still meant very little yarn was actually piling up in my future projects stash. However, this year for my graduation present I was given a lovely reconditioned Louet spinning wheel by my loving and astute family. :-) Now my production of good quality woolen yarns has probably quintupled, and I'm actually able to start thinking about making larger projects than just a pair of socks now and then. Good tools are very important. <br><br>Flax is next on my list of fibers to learn, but it's a more complicated process for both preparing the fiber for spinning (it has to "ret" for a fair bit of time to get the softer vegetable matter to release the tougher fibers from its matrix) and spinning (for good smooth yarn it needs to be spun wet, I understand.) So there will be a brand new learning curve there as well. But on the upside, I can also try making some good old-fashioned "linsey-woolsy" at some point. <br><br>Then there will at some point be rugs and such to try, once I get or make a loom... It's lucky for me that my family is very understanding of my eccentricities. ;-)<br><br><a href=#c8301229908806757244 title="comment permalink">5/24/10, 7:04 AM</a><br><br>

The only precipitation we get is some rain and snow in winter, and some significant rains during the local monsoon season, usually in July. State law actually prohibits communities from building reservoirs to trap this rainfall during the monsoon, as all the water eventually flows down to Phoenix, and it is all spoken for. As the local saying goes: Whiskey is for drinking; water is for fighting. There is an aquifer a couple hundred feet down, but it's been slowly going down as population has grown, and we are currently in a battle with the Salt River Project over a proposal to drill new wells that could affect the flow of one of the few rivers around here that actually flows all year long.<br><br>Sustainable for the long term? Not even close, unless the population goes back down to what it was when Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday lived here. If the grid goes down for more than a few weeks, a couple million people in the southwest will discover that most of what used to be northern Mexico really is uninhabitable without air conditioning, and the Mexicans can have it back.<br><br>But, having said that, with well water we have lots of farms with greenhouses (with shade cloth to protect against too much sun), and even a small photovoltaic power plant run by the local power company. The whole community is situated away from the major cities, with only a few easily-defensible chokepoints in or out of town, so if peak oil and deindustrialization really happen the way you predict, the community will survive (although at a much reduced size).<br><br>So, we'll just stay here for a while longer and encourage as many of our neighbors as possible to grow their own gardens, but in the long run we'll probably want to head back east where water actually falls out of the sky.<br><br>Speaking of back east, how's Western Maryland working out so far?

The first ten amendments include guarantees empowering state sovereignty, even in the case of a federal government becoming tyrannical.<br><br>The second amendment, the right to bear arms, was intended to prevent the federal government from disarming the states. That is, the states, the citizens, would always have the weapons - just not the legal use of them - to overthrow the government if that was needed as a last resort. That is, it is against the law for me to take up arms against my government, while at the same time it is illegal for the government to remove my <em>ability</em> to do so. This is but one more of the checks-and-balances that has kept the government sorta honest over the years.<br><br>When you read of Americans "arming up" - keep in mind the recent FBI crime reports. Several states in the last five years have passed laws allowing citizens to get a permit, and carry a concealed weapon. The FBI reports that in <em>those states</em> crime has gone down. Not just because "bad guys" are getting shot up left and right - that isn't happening. The mere presence or possibility of weapons deters some criminals, sometimes. One of our Senators recently proposed banning guns of any kind in airports. I personally emailed one of the Senators from my state, and requested an amendment: In any public or business place that bans weapons, require the following be posted - <em>"Warning, entering Disarmed Victim Zone. Risk of mass shootings is greater in Disarmed Victim Zones."</em> Imagine that at my local school yard. (Mass shootings historically only occur where weapons are banned - so much for gun control for protecting the innocent, or deterring the wicked.)<br><br>Today many Americans are recognizing that tyranny and corruption flourish in an unbalanced atmosphere of power - when one side is "armed" with economic or weapon or organizational power, there is more likelihood of abuse. Thus, there is a lot of attention being paid to gun control by people that, in my opinion, should know better. The weapons most Americans are accumulating are receiving more press today, and more politicians are trying to win more votes by making an issue of that - when there isn't much change from historical patterns of weapon ownership. Well, at least until this administration announced an unyielding attempt to disarm the citizenry. They weren't kidding.<br><br>I read with concern about South Africa, raiding citizens with registered firearms (they had the list of addresses to get started with), criminalizing unregistered firearms, and confiscating everything they can. This could happen anywhere firearms, firearm owners, or firearm purchases are registered - as in America. It is easy to assume that since that <em>last</em> administration wasn't <em>too</em> corrupt or inept, that this one won't be, nor will the next.<br><br>I think the presence of firearms helps to protect America from foreign invasion, helps keep violent crime in check, and helps keep the government honest. The current "fad" of flaunting weapons in the face of this administration is mere social intercourse - a refusal to accept intimidation that violates the law and our rights. If the administration had declared cats to be a national problem, and they intended to do away with private possession of cats - the protesters would be carrying cat leashes and cat carriers.<br><br>Then, of course, there are the survivalists worried about the coming zombie apocalypse (zombie: euphemism for attacker armed with weapons or numbers).<br><br><a href=#c3663333305674098398 title="comment permalink">5/26/10, 6:39 AM</a><br><br>

There are marginal lands that cannot be usefully used in grains - hillsides, poor ground, etc. - that goats or sheep can make good use of, and some cows. Some livestock like chickens, rabbits, and other small livestock can be raised mostly on waste and scraps, including compost. I have seen horse operations that use a hog or two to "turn" their compost heap. The Nordeens' biointensive efforts in Pennsylvania uses a three-pen system with chickens to pick over the accumulating material, followed by a pig in the full bin, while they use the emptying bin for fertilizer. Sharon Astyk at Casaubon's Book touches on frugal livestock raising, occasionally. The 19th century “10 Acres Enough” posits, “No man should try to farm more than he can adequately manure.”<br><br>And yet today's American meat industry for chicken, beef, and pork, suffers from the same monoculture, industrial approach that risks grain availability at the end of the era of cheap energy. Artificial Insemination has tied "development" of highly productive - read "specialized, single purpose" - Holstein-type dairy cows to a dangerously restricted gene pool. Yes, the cows providing today's milk for most producers turn out a lot of milk for the feed. But they require a lot of energy expensive and drug enhanced practices to maintain. <br>Many hogs today are raised in confinement buildings (unlike Dad's pasture-fed hogs). Maintaining the atmosphere, water, managing the manure, and preparing all the (grains!) feed for the hogs is very energy intensive. Lose power for a few days, and I cannot imagine all the hogs will survive.<br><br>Chickens raised two or even eighty at a time with a bit of grass (or pony droppings) to root through is a very different proposition from 2,000 to 100,000 birds in a big building, consuming tons of feed a day, requiring factories to process in a timely fashion, and lots of oil burned transporting feed, birds, and meat. Any part of the process that gets large - takes bunches of oil. Threaten the price or availability of oil (as in peak oil), and the equation comes apart. <br>Manure from industrial livestock farming is legitimately considered toxic waste. The best approach I have heard of is the million dollar hog effluvia farm process for composting and generating electricity from the generated methane. In Arizona I watched a (remote) site that composted maybe 20 to 50 semi-loads of manure at a time. They used an irrigation ditch to provide the water needed, and tractors to do the turning - oil at work, again.<br><br>Livestock in historical niches will be viable. But in modern farm-sized feedlots, or large flocks, you need cheap transportation and consume lots and lots of grains. And oil.<br><br>Consider how much garden or field you want to work by hand to produce the beets or hay or grain to feed livestock, if energy prices make operating and maintaining tractors (parts, lubricants, etc.) and other farm equipment problematic.<br>Cities running out of water will soon be raising questions - how many cows drinking 10-40 gallons of water per day can we afford? Nations with hungry people will be asking, how many cows and hogs can we feed three to fifteen pounds of grain a day? People wanting clean water will be asking, how many acres, and trucks, can we afford to disperse the tons of manure the modern "commercial animal farm operation" (CAFO, in USDA terms) generates?<br><br>That is why you do see livestock mentioned with gardens all the time. Look for "four chickens", "a few rabbits", "took the (2 or 3) goats in the car to have them bred." Did you know pigeons for eating are selling at $40-70/pair?<br><br><a href=#c2412339237480501568 title="comment permalink">5/27/10, 4:11 AM</a><br><br>

He says it mimics the way nature always provides a species of bird to follow herds of wild ruminants and clean up after them.

These pharmaceuticals also tend to come through in the manure, making it sub-optimal for compost and fertilizer because the stuff kills the soil-building worms, too. However, there's this weed. Our ancestors named it wormwood. It breaks down in compost, and the parasites haven't developed resistance to it in the 3,000 years of its recorded use.<br><br><a href=#c2289885998901507436 title="comment permalink">6/1/10, 2:16 AM</a><br><br>

I have a bad habit of slipping into mass-movement mode - if only I hadn't studied Advertising in college. What a waste! I just get so bummed when I see my smart friends playing FarmVille and FrontierVille. But not my problem, I have too much to learn to worry about that now.<br>Here's what I do now - it's pretty easy and doesn't drain time from actually doing something real. I take pictures of my garden and post it to facebook. And then my friends respond by talking about their gardens or by posting their own pictures. I took a picture of a grilled pizza done in an outdoor oven, and some friends responded by posting pictures of their grilled pizzas. My neighbor planted flowers on her deck, I planted tomatoes. I saw flowers and thought "I need flowers too, I have nothing good for the bees." Then she planted tomatoes and I gave her some of my leftover seedlings, so now she has even more tomatoes. My neighbor on the other side saw my tomatoes and started talking about the tomatoes his dad grew. I started talking to my hairdresser about my wheat grinder, and he started talking to me about the world of home coffee roasting.<br>I have to repeat to myself - must focus on learning and practicing what I learn. The communication and cross-pollination about it happens naturally and at the right time, no need to build a movement. :)<br><br><a href=#c1603275626458905243 title="comment permalink">7/2/10, 11:42 AM</a><br><br>
