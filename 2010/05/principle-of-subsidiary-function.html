I trust my readers will recognize a hint of sarcasm if I say that the good news just keeps on rolling in. Of the smoke plumes that were rising into the industrial world’s increasingly murky skies as last week’s post went up, one – the billowing cloud of assorted mis-, mal- and nonfeasance bubbling out of Goldman Sachs – has faded from the front pages for the moment, though it will doubtless be back before long. On the other hand, the two remaining – the cratering of Greece’s borrow-and-spend economics and the spreading ecological catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico – have more than made up the difference.<br><br>It’s a matter of chance, more than anything else, that Greece happened to become the poster child for what happens when you insist on buying off influential sectors of the electorate with money you don’t happen to have. What we are pleased to call democracy these days is a system in which factions of the political class contend for power by spending large sums of other people’s money to buy the temporary loyalty of voting blocs. There’s nothing especially novel in this system, by the way; the late Roman Republic managed (or, rather, mismanaged) its affairs in exactly the same manner, and such classical theorists as Polybius argued that this is the way democracies normally end up working (or, rather, not working).<br><br>You might think that Greece, which happens to be Polybius’ home turf, would have had the common sense to dodge this particular bullet. No such luck; recent Greek governments, like many others, made the strategic mistake of using borrowed funds to provide a good deal of that unearned largesse, and the resulting debt load eventually collided head on with the ongoing deleveraging of the global economy in the wake of the latest round of bubble economics. The result was a fiscal death spiral, as doubts about Greece’s ability to pay its debts drove up the interest rates Greece had to pay to finance those debts, increasing the doubts further; rinse and repeat until something comes unglued. The much-ballyhooed announcement of an EU bailout package stabilized the situation for a few days, but that’s about all; the death spiral has already resumed, accompanied by bloody riots in the streets of Athens and comments by the usual highly placed sources that some kind of default is becoming inevitable.<br><br>Headlines for the last few days have warned of similar head-on collisions taking shape in Spain and Portugal. What very few people in the mainstream media are willing to mention is that the most spectacular examples of borrow-and-spend economics are not little countries on the economic margins of Europe, but Britain and the United States. It’s anyone’s guess when investors will begin to realize that neither countries has any way of paying back the gargantuan sums both have borrowed of late to prop up their crippled economies; when it does become clear, the rush to the exits will likely be one for the record books.<br><br>It’s equally a matter of chance, in turn, that the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform happened to be the one to fail catastrophically. That something of the sort was going to happen was pretty much a given; drilling for oil a mile underwater is risky, complicated, technologically challenging work, and any oil well, anywhere, can undergo a blowout when it’s being drilled. It just so happened that this was the one that happened to blow, and the lax safety standards and budget-conscious corner-cutting endemic to today’s corporate world made it pretty much inevitable that when a blowout happened, it would turn into a disaster.<br><br>Bad as it is already, it may get much, much worse. According to a memo leaked to Gulf Coast newspapers, BP officials have privately admitted to the US government that the torrent of hot, high-pressure crude oil surging through the broken pipe could quite conceivably blow the remaining hardware off the top of the well. This would turn the current 5,000-barrel-a-day spill into a cataclysmic gusher of 40,000 to 60,000 barrels a day. Capping such a flow a mile under water is beyond current technology; if things go that way, there may be no other option than waiting until the flow drops to a more manageable level. If that means the death of every multicellular organism in the Gulf of Mexico, storm surges this hurricane season that leave everything for miles inland coated with black goo, and tar balls and dead birds floating ashore wherever the Gulf Stream goes – and yes, these are tolerably likely consequences if the wellhead blows – that’s what it means.<br><br>As I discussed in last week’s post, a common thread of complexity unites these crises with each other, and with others of the same magnitude that are statistically certain to happen in the months and years ahead of us. We – meaning here those of us who live in the world’s industrial nations – have allowed our societies to become more complex than any collection of human minds can effectively manage, and our only response to the problems this causes is to add additional layers of complexity. The result, of course, is that our societies become even more unmanageable, and the problems they generate even more extreme and intractable. Once again, rinse and repeat until something comes unglued.<br><br>Now the simple, logical solution to a problem caused by too much complexity is to reduce the amount of complexity. Joseph Tainter’s <i>The Collapse of Complex Societies</i>, which has deservedly become required reading in peak oil circles, argues that societal collapse has exactly this function; when a society has backed itself into a corner by heaping up more complexity than it can manage, collapse offers the one way out. In a post on <a href=http://www.theoildrum.com/ >The Oil Drum</a> a while back, Ugo Bardi made a similar point, arguing that if anyone in Roman times had tried to come up with a sustainable society to which the Roman world could transition, their best option would have looked remarkably like the Middle Ages.<br><br>Bardi pointed out, mind you, that there was precisely no chance that any such advice would have been taken by even the wisest of Roman emperors, and it’s just as true that a proposal to reduce the complexity of contemporary civilization can count on getting no more interest from the political classes of today’s industrial nations, or for that matter from the population at large. The experiment has been tried, after all; it’s worth remembering the extent to which the baby steps toward lower complexity taken in the 1970s helped to fuel the Reagan backlash of the 1980s.<br><br>Now it’s true that some of the achievements of the 1970s – the dramatic advances in organic agriculture, the birth of the modern recycling industry, the refinement of passive solar heating and solar hot water technology, and more – remained viable straight through the backlash era, and are viable today; and it’s also true that today’s economic debacle, not to mention the looming impact of peak oil, bid fair to make a good many of the legacies of the 1970s much more popular in the years right ahead of us. Still, the dream of a collective conversion to sustainable lifestyles that filled so many pages in <i>Rain</i>, <i>Seriatim</i>, and other journals of that period is further away now than it was then; so much time and so many resources have been wasted that it’s too late for such a collective conversion to work, even if the political will needed for one could be found.<br><br>Still, when you get right down to it, the hope of a mass conversion to sustainability by political means – by legislation, let’s say, backed up by the massive new bureaucracy that would be needed to enforce "green laws" affecting every detail of daily life – is yet another attempt to solve a complexity-driven problem by adding on more complexity. That’s a popular strategy, for the same reasons that any other attempt to deal with the problems of complexity through further complexity is popular these days: it makes sense to most of us, since it’s the sort of thing we’re used to doing, and it provides a larger number of economic and social niches for specialists – in this case, members of the professional activist community, who might reasonably expect to step into staff positions in that new bureaucracy – who have the job of managing the new level of complexity for the benefit – at least in theory – of those who have to live with it.<br><br>All of this is very familiar ground, echoing as it does the way that countless other efforts at reform have turned into layers of complexity in the past. To suggest, as I do, that it won’t work, doesn’t mean that it won’t be tried. It’s being tried right now, in many countries and on many different levels, with enough success that in Britain, at least, the number of Transition Town activists who have found their way onto municipal payrolls has excited grumbling from members of less successful pressure groups.<br><br>In the same way, I think it’s beyond question that every other reasonably well funded attempt to solve the problems of complexity with more complexity will get at least some funding, and be given at least a token trial. We’ve already had the corn ethanol boom here in the US; the cellulosic ethanol and algal biodiesel booms have been delayed a bit by the impact of a collapsing economy on credit markets, but somebody will doubtless find a way around that in good time; down the road a bit, a crash program to build nuclear power plants is pretty much a foregone conclusion; fusion researchers will have the opportunity to flush billions more dollars down the same rathole they’ve been exploring since the 1950s; you name it, if it’s complex and expensive, it will get funding.<br><br>Not all of that money will be entirely wasted, either. Current windpower technologies and PV panels may not be sustainable over the long term, but for the decades immediately ahead they’re an excellent investment; anything that can keep the grid supplied with power, even intermittently, as fossil fuel production drops out from under the world’s industrial economies may be able to help make the Long Descent less brutal than it might otherwise be. With any luck, there’ll be a boom in home insulation and weatherstripping, a boom in solar hot water heaters, a boom in backyard victory gardens, and the like – small booms, probably, since they aren’t complex and expensive enough to catch at the contemporary imagination, but even a small boom might help.<br><br>On the whole, though, the pursuit of complexity as a solution for the problems caused by complexity is a self-defeating strategy. It happens to be the self-defeating strategy to which we’re committed, collectively and in most cases individually as well, and it can be dizzyingly hard for many people to think of any action at all that doesn’t follow it. Take a moment, now, before reading the rest of this post, to give it a try. Can you think of a way to deal with the problems of complexity in today’s industrial nations – problems that include, but are not limited to, rapidly depleting energy supplies, ecological destruction, and accelerating economic turbulence – that doesn’t simply add another layer of complexity to the mess?<br><br>There’s at least one such way, and longtime readers of this blog will not be surprised to learn that it’s a way pioneered decades ago, in a different context, by maverick economist E.F. Schumacher. That way starts with what he termed the Principle of Subsidiary Function. This rule holds that the most effective arrangement to perform any function whatsoever will always assign that function to the smallest and most local unit that can actually perform it.<br><br>It’s hard to think of any principle that flies more forcefully in the face of every presupposition of the modern world. Economies of scale and centralization of control are so heavily and unthinkingly valued that it rarely occurs to anyone that in many situation they might not actually be helpful at all. Still, Schumacher was not a pie-in-the-sky theorist; he drew his conclusions on the basis of most of a lifetime as a working economist in the business world. Like most of us, he noticed that the bigger and more centralized an economic or political system happened to be, the less effectively it could respond to the complex texture of local needs and possibilities that makes up the real world.<br><br>This rule can be applied to any aspect of the predicament of industrial society you care to name, but just now I want to focus on its application to the vexed question of how to respond to that predicament. Attempts to make such a response on the highest and least local level possible – for example, the failed climate negotiations that reached their latest pinnacle of absurdity in the recent debacle at Copenhagen – have done quite a respectable job of offering evidence for Schumacher’s contention. Attempts to do the same thing at a national level aren’t doing much better. The lower down the ladder of levels you go, and the closer you get to individuals and families confronting the challenges of their own lives, the more success stories you find.<br><br>By the same logic, the best place to start backing away from an overload of complexity is in the daily life of the individual. What sustains today’s social complexity, in the final analysis, is the extent to which individuals turn to complex systems to deal with their needs and wants. To turn away from complex systems on that individual level, in turn, is to undercut the basis for social complexity, and to begin building frameworks for meeting human needs and wants of a much simpler and thus more sustainable kind. It also has the advantage – not a small one – that it’s unnecessary to wait for international treaties, or government action, or anything else to begin having an effect on the situation; it’s possible to begin right here, right now, by identifying the complex systems on which you depend for the fulfillment of your needs and wants, and making changes in your own life to shift that dependency onto smaller or more local systems, or onto yourself, or onto nothing at all – after all, the simplest way to deal with a need or want, when doing so is biologically possible, is to stop needing or wanting it.<br><br>Such personal responses have traditionally been decried by those who favor grand collective schemes of one kind or another. I would point out in response, first, that a small step that actually happens will do more good than a grandiose plan that never gets off the drawing board, a fate suffered by nearly all of the last half century’s worth of grandiose plans for sustainability; second, that starting from personal choices and local possibilities, rather than abstract and global considerations, makes it a good deal more likely that whatever evolves out of the process might actually work; and third, that tackling the crisis of industrial society from the top down has been tried over and over again by activists for decades now, with no noticeable results, and maybe it’s time to try something else. How that "something else" might be pursued in practice will be the topic of next week’s post.

As noted, top down solutions can't, won't, and haven't worked (and certainly won't be attempted until it is too late).<br><br>Today my partner and I made pies. When we counted up the cost of ingredients (let alone labour) they are more expensive than what can be bought at the supermarket. But they do have the advantage that the ingredients don't rely on a complex society to provide them, so I will still be eating pies long after the pie factory no-longer exists.<br><br><br>There is an additional benefit from what you are suggesting as well. That is the "multiple lifeboats" that it will inevitably create. Many people may do a little to reduce the complexity of their lives, but some will do a lot (my partner and I are working in that direction). Therefore while the whole society may still collapse, there will be many pockets of individuals and small groups who will be able to just continue on in the much simplified world that emerges. <br><br>That has to provide a good foundation for the rapid formation of new communities (they may even be based on principles of sustainability). <br><br>I have become convinced that workable communities will only emerge as they are needed (i.e. after our existing communities stop working and collapse). I hear a lot of anecdotal evidence to support this idea. "Transition towns" and community building efforts seem to cause more conflict among members than actually achieve anything. <br><br>So, taking up your suggestion that individual action is the way forward makes a lot of sense to me. At the very least you will be in a better position to help yourself, and (if they are lucky) your family, friends, and neighbours.<br><br>Most people scorn the "lifeboat" and "doom-stead" concepts, but I just see people doing those things as early adopters of "simplification".<br><br>Thanks once again for an interesting post JMG.<br><br><a href=#c2501632129140358702 title="comment permalink">5/5/10, 11:16 PM</a><br><br>

<div class="avtb a_4584ab" id=c7879047436285112211></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/04892895612663615616 rel=nofollow>Neon</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Very big complexity reduction lies at our daily food chain. By reducing the food manufacture - from highly ineffective processing of corn, soy, rice and other grains into the artificial food substances we eat daily. By consuming the grains and legumes directly, by learning to cook them correctly at each household, we would save enormous energy and complexity.<br><br>Macrobiotic movement has taught me a lot about these things. And how profound the whole food topic is. How much our daily food effects our correct thinking (mind and body), because all is connected in the Universe, all is different quality of energy and our body and mind is of the quality of our daily eating habits. Actually, macrobiotic says, that the deepening crisis has direct roots in the quality of food we eat. With the lower quality, the lower the judgement of the people.<br>I can translate the Tainter's complexity description for myself as the case of symptom treatments - when you treat symptoms and not the cause of the problem, you are adding complexity (in general I think it's true). But I can see, how the finding of the real cause become the complex topic itself for the general population. Opinions differ and people are lost in the world of symptomatic labyrinth. And this is what macrobiotic ascribes to the judgement deterioration, caused by the poor quality of food.<br>I highly recommend Michio Kushi's book "One Peaceful World" for a very interesting and very challenging view on the topic of human wars, society collapses and human behaviour in general (there is only one chapter about wars, but worth reading imho).<br><br>The macrobiotic logic is very much misunderstood, but for me, it's just the typical sign of avoiding the cause treatment and being lost in another complexities. Personal addictions are hardest to cure, and our personal food addictions are manifested many times daily on our plates. The real causes are usually the nearest to us and the hardest to conquer - change yourself and you change the world. Experiment with foods and observe the effects and you will understand the "change yourself" part much more.<br><br><a href=#c7879047436285112211 title="comment permalink">5/6/10, 12:17 AM</a><br><br>

I just wanted to pick up on one statement in your article.. you wrote;<br><br>"It’s being tried right now, in many countries and on many different levels, with enough success that in Britain, at least, the number of Transition Town activists who have found their way onto municipal payrolls has excited grumbling from members of less successful pressure groups".<br><br>I wish it were thus (the payroll bit, not the grumbling bit), but as someone very active in Transition in the UK, I confess to being puzzled by this assertion. I am unaware of anyone active in Transition who is on 'municipal payrolls'. There are, to the best of my knowledge, no Councils who employ a 'Transition person', and none that fund their local Transition initiatives, although there are occasional projects where the two might partner together. <br><br>There have been examples of Transition groups working with Councils in an unpaid capacity (such as Transition Stroud feeding (pardon the pun)into their Council's food policymaking, and also of occasional bits of paid consultancy work (such as the Bristol Peak Oil Report) being done by people who are also active in Transition, but the sweeping nature of your statement is at sharp odds with the facts, and I would like to enquire as to what that statement was based on? In terms of the grumbling, there is always grumbling about different groups and the scale of their success or otherwise, but if it is based on assertions such as this, it is rather ill-founded grumbling....<br>With thanks, <br>Rob Hopkins<br>Transition Network.<br><br><a href=#c5651985512715709789 title="comment permalink">5/6/10, 1:21 AM</a><br><br>

Keep up the good work).<br><br>Sustainability, living within your means and having a small eco footprint are beyond the majority of people within the industrial society. To do this plunges you pretty much immediately into the Middle Ages. It's simply because you have to work that much harder on your own and families survival than people are now used to and also rely on your immediate community which quite a lot of us have given the finger to. You also are at the whim of nature which most people seem to have lost touch with, as they're simply detached from it.<br><br>You quite rightly pointed out many weeks ago that the modern home is imbued with cultural significance. I'd like to take this further and say that it is also insular. It retards the development of a community and gives the occupants a pretence that they are immune from the vagaries of nature and/or the community. The reality though is that this is a facade and once the energy supply stops (or becomes intermittent), the facade drops straight away.<br><br>Most people simply don't care because if it involves some sort of sacrifice or cost they seem to not be interested. This is certainly the case here in Australia where we enjoy relatively cheap electricity courtesy of low quality brown coal.<br><br>There also seems to be the strange current in society that you can purchase your way through to a sustainable world (think green labelled products). This is simply business as usual with a bit of green washing.<br><br>I often wonder how many of the readers and commenter’s in this blog are taking positive steps to insulate themselves (or their communities) or do they read this blog from their McMansions just to feel good about themselves?<br><br>As a suggestion, if you do nothing else plant some fruit trees and vegies.<br><br>You are again right when you point out that current renewable technology is just a stop gap to buy time. If the grid was to fail tomorrow, then even the best PV / wind off grid systems would only have a life span of around 15 years as they are limited by the battery life. You may get power after this time, but only during the day and/or when the wind is blowing. This is certainly not what people are used to and it wouldn't be adequate enough to run a refrigerator which can run 24/7 depending on the ambient temperature.<br><br>Fear not though, as plenty of people made it through the Middle Ages without advanced medication or refrigeration. They might not have lived as long a life or as hedonistic a life, but they still made it.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><a href=#c5179947109648770199 title="comment permalink">5/6/10, 2:27 AM</a><br><br>

In the course of denouncing TT for selling out to the status quo, it mentioned that a number of Transition Town activists had gotten themselves hired by city governments.

So much of our current agricultural knowledge is archaic and out-of-date (even a lot of organic methods). But, the techniques coming out of the permaculture movement (biodynamics, biointensive, and edible forest gardening alike)are making way for a new sort of green revolution -- based on appropriate technology and ecological methods that build soil, save energy, sequester carbon and produce gluts of food. So I see these ideas and techniques spreading like mycelium. Each new site that comes online is another hub and demonstration site. In my short time involved in this work, I've seen it spread, much like the hyphae of the mycelium spread beneath the mulch of the forest, creating a network that will sooner or later encompass the globe. I'm guessing you discuss something like this in the Ecotechnic Future? <br><br>So, I think that along with victory gardens, we need WAY more forest gardens, because there are going to be generations of humans that will undoubtedly be hungry... In more than one way.<br><br>And just an interesting tidbit. There are in Brazil, as many permaculture projects/sites in operation as the sum total of projects on every continent.

I am dropping you a line to thank you for the weekly inspiration your blog is. You wrote:<br>"I would point out in response, first, that a small step that actually happens will do more good than a grandiose plan that never gets off the drawing board."<br><br>Absolutely! I worked for many years for government agencies as an agriculture specialist and it was, for the most part, a very frustrating exercice in futility. The real solutions to the demise of the small family farms were simple, but rejected because they went for the most part against the system. So, basically, I thought than rather than cashing taxpayer money, it was better to buy a small farm and try to make it work by all means necessary. It is not easy, but it is really rewarding. Nothing grandiose, but among the setbacks, the victories, like a freezer full of meat, feel real.<br>One of my issues is how to approach people in their 20s in my circle of accointance, that generation that grew up connected to all the modern gadgetery. Somehow, I cant muster the courage to tell them their dreamworld is not that far from crashing all around them. For them, technology will come at their rescue.

How about an end to the automobile and air-centered transportation system. Of course, after making such a suggestion one typically hears that people have to get around somehow. But people don't have to get around nearly as much as they do now. No one has ever died for lack of a 2-week European vacation or a long weekend in Cancun.

I'm not going to beat around the bush and just go ahead and say I find it pretty annoying that you seem to have no problem repeating the baseless assertions of others as if they were the gospel truth. Why ruin a good post with that sort of nonsense? I read your first response to Rob and thought "really? He's <i>got</i> to be kidding." Alas, no. I'm a regular reader, and very much enjoy the vast majority of your posts, but this sort of thing really, really irritates me. Intellectual honesty would seem to require you make sure your assertions are backed up by facts, or stated clearly as opinions. Unless you've made a political decision to excoriate the transition movement.<br><br>Having said that, I'm afraid I must half-contradict Rob Hopkins. I'm heavily involved in a transition initiative in Pennsylvania. I also happen to work as a planner for local government (but not the same government in which my initiative is based). I am quite aware of the apparent contradiction. Living amidst such a contradiction, however, has given me, I would argue, an expanded perspective. I think, if any level of government is likely to survive into the post-complex age, it's some form of local government. Local government has at least the <i>capacity</i> to understand its people; it <i>can be</i> responsive to its people; it has, in PA at least, centuries of experience within its jurisdiction (not always useful experience, admittedly); and it has useful expertise that the average person has not.<br><br>Maybe it's just that I happen to work for a relatively progressive (and fiscally conservative, so debt-free) township, one that believes in the importance of clean water and works actively to preserve farmland and its quasi-natural landscape. I'm sure, if I happened to work for some of the other municipalities in my county, those that have been raising taxes 30%+ lately, I might have a different perspective.<br><br>Finally, I see no reason to level half-baked accusations at transition towners; their (my) aims and yours seem reasonably well-aligned. We see collapse coming; we know that the time of postmodern hyper-complexity is coming to a close, and are working actively to educate and invigorate our neighbors regarding this fact. We work on a local level, with a bottom-up ethos. We are working to build resilience and break our addiction to cheap &amp; dangerous fossil energy. We may fail. What human endeavor was ever a sure thing?<br><br>Perhaps in an upcoming post you can tell us what you're up to in the place where you live; I'll withhold baseless asides about "walking the talk" till then. Thanks,<br><br>Tony<br>Transition Lancaster<br><br><a href=#c6713320672327222339 title="comment permalink">5/6/10, 12:42 PM</a><br><br>

I sometimes ponder this future and try to identify how the conditions are different from, say, 500 AD Europe.<br><br>Without going into all those details, I want to bring up one question regarding organic farming / permaculture systems / etc: In the real world, where human aggression can and will happen, how stable can forest gardens hope to be? <br><br>In wars of the past, armies could pillage land and burn the fields of their enemies, potentially causing starvation... but those fields would be equally productive the next year after. <br><br>A forest garden on the other hand, must be built up over years to achieve its maximum yield. A group of people relying on such an investment appear quite vulnerable to enemies inclined to burn their forest, enslave the people and then have them plow the land the year after and grow some wheat to feed the conquerors...<br><br>Clearly not a concern for the immediate future - but I think this limitation of perennial plant systems tends by overlooked by idealists who see them as the absolute right way of the future.<br><br>For the record, I'm a fan of permaculture and edible forest gardens!

The problem with finding "the most effective arrangement to perform any function whatsoever” is not finding “the smallest and most local unit that can actually perform it”.<br><br>The problem is that you need a means of *comparison* and people mostly don't do that, or use a means of comparison that they entirely misunderstand the consequences of. People mostly use *judgment* and just pick the choice that best fits their own cultural values. They mostly don’t even know how the physical effects would accumulate if one or another rule of comparison were used . <br><br>I have a hugely long list of examples of how we are being tied in knots by ignoring the vast differences between what our cultural values tell us to do and the effects we think we are having on the physical place we live in. Take the main "rebound effect" of better healthcare. That is to assure we'll need ever more health care. For one, the profits go to multiplying the cures, and then it doesn’t reduce our total need for healthcare but actually multiplies that too. The more diseases we cure the worse diseases we get. <br><br>We're still going to be mortal anyway is the point, and only needing to pay ever more for it over time following a perpetual growth model of … *profitability*. Everybody’s in favor of that aren’t they?? I hope that points out the problem I’m trying to raise, that it’s a problem when you way of defining "effective arrangement to perform any function" turns out to be simply fictitious. <br><br>Another good case in point is the way resources are allocated, according to where they will produce the highest financial rate of return. That's the economic version of Schumacher's principle "effective arrangement". What that means, of course, is our resources are allocated to maximize the rate at which we use the returns to multiply our returns. {.. sounds like the same problem coming up..} So, we optimize our resource use for doubling the scale and complexity of our solutions. <br><br>We don’t notice things like how that switches to multiplying our problems at natural environmental limits, for example, just that to solve our multiplying problems we seem to need ever more efficient allocation of resources to address them. Here’s the worst part. Did you know, that same feature of economic decision-making not only 1) controls investment decisions worldwide today, but is also 2) retained as part of virtually all the alternative economy models published in the last three decades too, and in particular is 3)relied on to create the profits for reducing CO2 and implementing all other institutionally supported sustainability plans? Each and every one of those solves one thing by a method that multiplies the impacts of other things. <br><br>Once you check it out and find “Yikes! It’s true!” you have to ask how did we get in this ridiculous jam. All the easy epithets are probably deserved, of course, but the practical matter of living in a changing world and not paying attention to its changes is the basic procedural problem. What have now become a network of completely fatal survival strategies used to work simply great. <br><br>That was back when we were small and having a systematic way to multiply your control and use of your environment created an ever greater bounty. Now it doesn’t. Now our highest values applied to our trusted solution drives us irreversibly to take on ever more unachievable tasks. We should think of something else to do.<br><br><a href=#c5984127223793351905 title="comment permalink">5/6/10, 1:16 PM</a><br><br>

An old-fashioned fireplace is a simple thing, and if New England had to go back to heating its homes with fireplaces, the region would be treeless in less than a decade. A masonry heater or a 21st century wood stove is a downright complex piece of engineering but, if every home had one, we might be able to refrain from chopping the forests down faster than they can regrow. For that matter, the very notion of simplicity can hide any number of unspoken (and perhaps unconscious) assumptions. An obvious example is a phenomenon you've already pointed out: the use of the word "efficiency" by economists to mean "labor efficiency" on the assumption that labor will always be the limiting factor in economic activity. Another example: the division of societies into simple vs. complex can only be done by excluding from the definition of "society" the myriad relationships between humans and other species on which every human society must depend. Think of North America a hundred years ago, when most families farmed and therefore most people got up close and personal with plants, animals, fungi and bacteria in a deliberate, conscious way at least a dozen times a day. <br><br>I think it's more accurate to think in terms of intermediation and disintermediation. In an expanding economy, individuals specialize and consume each others' specialties, with the complexity that used to be characteristic of household and village/town/neighborhood economies being increasingly handed off to regional, national and global economies. Middlemen (of both genders) abound, which is why the process is called intermediation. In a contracting economy, it makes more sense to disintermediate, to eliminate the middleman, to take that complexity back into our lives and, in so doing, take back our power.<br><br><a href=#c3588273854013282137 title="comment permalink">5/6/10, 5:25 PM</a><br><br>

You are truly an inspiration. I love the points that you made in regards to the painful transition of Rome to the medieval period. As a student of history, I cannot agree with you more that this is an excellent parallel to the current predicament facing the industrialized world. Like modern society, Rome in transition was a society built upon complexities that could not be adjudicated without emperors making political decisions that would have amounted to political suicide. In our current paradigm of 24/7 news and perpetual election cycles, I too believe that we cannot expect answers from the top, and even if they do come up with something, it most certainly would not be a long-term sustainable solution. <br><br>As such, if a new era of self reliance is upon us, as I believe it is, then it becomes imperative for basic survival for people to learn to advocate and plan for themselves. We cannot expect the government to fix this, it is in our hands. <br><br>As such, equipped with this knowledge, I think that one of the best things that can be done to spread this message is the simple act of educating people. My wife and I try to live off the grid as much as possible. We eat only locally grown food, we have a large garden, we bake our own bread, we do not use a clothes dryer, etc. When I tell people about this the immediate reaction is usually disbelief, followed by keen interest. I have gotten more people thinking about energy consumption, sustainable living, and local agriculture this way than any government sponsored message could ever dream of. I love seeing the light bulb go on so to speak when i tell people of the dangers of industrialized society and the very real possibilities of concepts such as peak oil and climate change. I think it is easier to hear such an argument put forth by a friend or neighbor rather then a bureaucrat because it has a more immediate impact (not to mention the current public distrust of any large-scale institution, which certainly feeds into this as well). The message needs to come from the bottom up, not the top down.<br><br>People need to know that the possibility of the rug being pulled out from underneath of them is very real. Armed with this knowledge, communities can begin the process of breaking the complexities that govern modern society and enslave it.<br><br><a href=#c2955812298171297860 title="comment permalink">5/6/10, 7:51 PM</a><br><br>

My foremost objection to it is precisely that it is a movement. <br><br>I'm far too much a curmudgeon, particularly in my old age, to ever be a part of any movement again. I've lived through too many movements, from the late '50s onward, and seen the dark side of each and every one of them grow stronger as the succeed in achieving their goals. I have no doubt that a dark side will emerge in this movement also. <br><br>This is simply because human nature has so much darkness in it, so much lust for power-over.

Rustics, rubes.<br><br>That isn't so today. Like so many people, there are many even among the pagan and neo-pagan faiths that feel that "caring for the earth" means "the Kyoto Protocol". Activism, rather than acting as husband to the green earth. Bumper stickers and shopping at Whole Foods instead of hoeing and getting out there in the dark of the moon to put down the wheat that will be their bread for the year, and the flax that they will wear.<br><br>Those that raise their tomatoes, and new potatoes, and sweet corn know the beauty of a bounty to share, of learning and sharing good recipes and practices to enjoy home-raised popcorn and brussels sprouts off the plant (or so I have read; I hope to try it myself this year).<br><br>I have six chickens, three of them are roosters. Two of the non-layers should have been table provender last year, yet I still find that first (and second!) butchering attempt on my own . . intimidating. Dad raised hogs - I have been there for farrowing and putting down runts and the injured. I have fed, and watered, and cleaned hog houses. But we hauled a pig to the butcher, when the time came.<br><br>Which came first, the chicken, or the egg? Which comes first, the farm-raised wheat, or a local miller? The smoke house, or meat to cure? The garden, or space and knowledge to prepare and use or store the produce?<br><br>Should a faithful group have a publication, a bulletin or newsletter, to unite them? Should it include weekly reminders of average season activities in the garden? Out of sight, out of mind. Should spiritual training ignore the mundane like hygiene, gardening, and household choices? Maybe. I practice solitary Wicca, and don't leave myself near enough notes. Seriously.<br><br>When working in software development in the early 1980's, I learned a nifty editor program on the VAX minicomputer. I learned the editor from someone that knew it, that was enthused about the editor. I was responsible for getting four or five others active and enthused. I think many of us overlook how very important it is, to know your proselyte. Learning from a class is great, some things can come from a book or blog - insights, "Ah, ha!" moments. Crafts and skills, though, seem to take deeper root from enthusiasts we are familiar with and respect.<br><br>So that is my thought. That too many people confuse social activism with cultural husbandry. And it takes enthused neighbors to awaken new interests.<br><br><a href=#c3150942389374548647 title="comment permalink">5/6/10, 8:34 PM</a><br><br>

Good point about food forests being vulnerable to fire. You are spot on. Forest and fire ecology interest me because it is certainly one of the biggest vulnerabilities to where I live. Take a look at you tube under "Black Saturday" and you get an understanding.<br><br>So what do you do? <br>Decrease the number of plant species (in the over storey and under storey) that encourage fire and increase those that don't (think % of oil in the leaves).<br>Increase the quantity and depth of top soil so that it increases the water retention capacity.<br>Put swales into your landcape to increase the water retention of the land.<br>Hope that your mulch (and encourage it to) breaks down quickly and forms top soil so that it doesn't burn.<br>Plant far more densely than in commercial scenarios so that transpiration is reduced (even if growth is slower).<br>Clean up forest fuels at ground level and either chip them or burn them. It takes on average around three years here for hardwood sticks / leaves / branches to break down.<br>Water in dry weather.<br>Catch rain water into water tanks so that it is available for use during periods of dry weather (think 100,000 litres or more).<br>Encourage fungal growths which speed up the eco system by quickly breaking down plant matter into top soil.<br>Encourage the local fauna to share your excess produce and they will provide you with mowing services and scats. We have both black tail wallabies and wombats plus countless birds and reptiles all of which increase yields. <br>Less grass = lower fire risk.<br>Some weeds stay very green over summer, so keep them.<br>Be vigilant and join the local fire brigade as they need your services and time.<br><br>Remember though that grains and mono cultures are far more vulnerable than forest ecologies by far. Also, well established fire retardant trees (think oaks, elms, poplars, rainforest species especially our local ones) bounce back better than those trees which require an ecology based on fire.<br><br>SE Australia is pretty much the canary in the coal mine. In terms of climate we get the lot. At altitude here it can go from snowing and floods one year to drought the next. It's pretty much what the rest of the world can expect from climate wierding. It's not easy, some days over winter it gets down to -1 and over summer up to 40.<br><br>JMG. I understand about the fruit trees. Before we started this journey / adventure, I had no idea that it took so many years to produce fruit from fruit trees. There's no easy way to speed this process up though. I recommend to try some seedling fruit trees as you might just find that with the changing climate they outperform the dwarf fruit trees as their root systems are deeper and more vigorous. Dwarf fruit trees = not very vigorous. I urge you to check out the work of Jackie French as I have much respect for her wisdom and observation.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><a href=#c4204354776850358819 title="comment permalink">5/7/10, 2:08 AM</a><br><br>

Drinking water supply is a key issue.<br><br>Just to our north, Hickman County was largely without electricity for several days, and remains almost entirely without municipal water still. Citizens are by and large flushing their toilets with buckets dipped from creeks, and getting drinking water from bottles at emergency aid centers. Even people who are on their own wells usually require electricity to run the pumps, hence when the lights go out, so does the water. <br><br>Ordinarily, if you are on city water it seems like the simplest thing on earth -- open the faucet, out comes the water. A private well with electric pump can seem almost as invisible and flawless. But once something upsets the apple cart, it all falls apart. These systems of course are 100% dependent on great networks of electrical distribution, and in the case of city water also massive water distribution infrastructure. They tumble like a house of cards when nature decides to get restless. <br><br>Here at out place we are fortunate enough to have spring water that comes out of the hill far enough upslope to power a ram pump (a magical device that uses gravity to pump water uphill, no external power source required). The ram pump feeds an elevated storage tank, which then delivers pressurized water to the house. On the face of it, to most people, this seems a lot more complicated than the more "modern" alternatives. I need to check the pump every day, it needs frequent tweeking because of small obstructions or changes in the discharge from the spring, etc. Hundreds of meters of water line need to be maintained. Overall, though, it averages out to a few minutes of my time a day, even figuring in the occasional days when I need to work on it for several hours. And when the power goes out, the water continues. In the flood, one of the water lines was broken. After a half hour and a few spare parts to rig up a patch that will serve until the floodwaters finish receding, we had our water back at somewhat reduced pressure. Because, in reality, my system is in total significantly simpler than the seemingly "effortless" supply systems most people are connected to; AND it is well within the abilities of one single person to construct, install, maintain, and repair.<br><br>Now, of course, in the bigger picture, my system is still more complex than it appears. I depend on plastic pipes and metal valves, none of which I can fabricate myself from local materials. In the long run the supply of these things will likely falter; still, I expect my system will be running long after the power grid and city water system have failed. Plus it is a simple matter to adjust it as energy-intensive materials grow scarce; eventually the folks living here (I'll be long dead by then, in all likelyhood) will probably be back to hauling water in homemade clay pots and baskets, or shunting water through hand-crafted wooden flumes. Many people will figure out how to rig windmills to their existing wells and springs to fill wooden storage tanks. And the municipal water system will have long since filled in with tree roots and rodent burrows.<br><br>As a p.s., JMG, I'm not sure if you met a young man named Joshua Landtroop when you were down here for PUF; he would have been about 18 then. Unfortunately, he was one of the first victims of the flooding in Nashville, drowned in a flash flood while trying to get home from work on Saturday.<br><br><a href=#c8293489612548527754 title="comment permalink">5/7/10, 9:36 AM</a><br><br>

Let us suppose they determine a number that would make a sustainable population in those regions would be, oh, suppose 50% of current population levels. Just wildly supposing here. Now the wise group decides to voluntarily reduce their impact, and their total numbers are reduced by half in the next generation. Let us ignore the 8.1 per couple fertility rate among Muslims, and those other peoples currently in excess of the minimum of 2.1 live children per couple for a culture to sustain itself over 25 years, and assume world and regional populations don't increase. That would put our wise people with a 5% minority of a population now 95% of current levels. That makes the wise, not counting expectable population growths, now 1 in 19, instead of the 1 in 10 that started. As economic and food stress build, even apart from any environmental stresses, how likely is it to be that someone stands up and says, "Hey, there is food in those barns over there!" "Share and Share Alike!" will be the rational for "nationalizing" minority-held assets. I am thinking of the example of the originators of what we think of as modern farming practices (before industrial farming). <br><br>The Anabaptists in Europe were persecuted for witchcraft (despite strict reformation teachings) because their fields vastly outproduced their neighbors. The use of manure, of managing weeds and other improved practices were scoffed at - and the Anabaptists killed and driven from their homes. Their descendants split into today's Mennonite and Amish communities - that still hold themselves separate, and maintain a reverence for nurturing the ground they farm.<br><br>Voluntary population control, and even, I think, voluntary withdrawal from the highly marketed consumerist lifestyle, must be done in a way that leaves the next generation in sufficient control of their situation, and secure in their homes and lives, to hold their own regardless of those with situational ethics (those with hungry families) would do.<br><br>The US Congress has been lamenting how overspending today will be a burden to our children. We will need to be careful about what our choices today means to the next generation. Gardening, animal and land husbandry? I cannot see a downside. Become more secure in our homes, with regard to debt and food? That might or might not raise security issues, make us and our children targets of the lawless. Produce a smaller community for the next generation? Fewer people to maintain progress, propagate skills, solve problems, understand a useful philosophy. Below a sustainable population, villages and communities cease to be significant entities.<br><br>I think it is more important to choose mates wisely, to build a robust and ethical home culture, than to unilaterally decide to reduce the next generation's population. It is solely the <em>unilateral</em> part that concerns me.<br><br><a href=#c3818540142680010246 title="comment permalink">5/7/10, 5:55 PM</a><br><br>

There is neither surety nor permanence to be found here.<br><br>If, however, you seek merely the preservation of diversity -- of species, of cultures, of futures for the human race -- that is an end amenable to the living.<br><br>It may be that transitioners court corruption through their participation in a "movement" which, by virtue of its worldliness, can never hope to fully escape the "dark side" of human nature, as you put it. That, however, does not damn it, I think.<br><br>I will make no claims that the Transition "movement" -- to the extent it is such (everywhere a localized enterprise animated by the common belief in the inevitability of a 'Long Descent') -- should it ever succeed in its aims (a possibility at the remotest corners of my wildest dreams), will be immune from the potentially corrupting influences of power. Maybe, in one or two generations' time, our grandchildren or great-grandchildren will need to throw off the yoke of the dictatorial "Transitionistas". I wish them luck in their struggles.<br><br>In the here and now, however, I am concerned primarily with the preservation of possibilities.

I know that's one of his sources, though I think he had others; the same notion has been in circulation in alternative economics for quite a while now. <br><br>Vera, the point of the last couple of posts isn't that complexity is bad by definition. It's that when a society's problems are being caused by too much complexity, more complexity is not a good idea! I'd encourage you to judge incorporation on its own merits; if it offers a way to get control back from the county, it may be a good option. <br><br>Robert, er, and how do you propose to make that happen?

As the proverbial saying has it, one definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting to get different results. <br><br>Brad, since only a tiny minority of people listen to pleas for voluntary population reduction, the difficulty never arises. <br><br>Tony, one of the things that troubles me most about the Transition Town movement here in America is the extent to which people involved in it fly off the handle at any suggestion of criticism. This isn't the first example here, as I'm sure you know.<br>At this point the question is a matter of "he said, she said" -- Rob insists nobody from the TT movement is on local government payrolls; a widely discussed critique of TT says the opposite; I don't have the funds to have somebody go knocking on doors in another country to find out who's right, so it will have to remain there until somebody presents me with concrete evidence of one kind or another. <br><br>As for what I do, well, if you've read this blog you have a fair idea. I don't own or use a car, a TV, or a good many of the other technologies most people in the industrial world consider essential; my carbon footprint is modest even by European standards; I'm actively involved in keeping an old community group, the local Masonic lodge, alive and kicking; the organic garden out back is coming along very nicely, and my spouse and I have a long list of green projects and retrofits lined up to put into action as money and time permit. I learned a lot of things in the 70s and early 80s, during the heyday of the appropriate tech movement, and if you're familiar with <i>The Integral Urban House</i> and books of the same kind, you'll have a pretty good idea of what we're doing with the 1920 brick bungalow we now own. Stay tuned for more in later posts here. <br><br>Danby, I'm the one who keeps on suggesting that Distributists need to get their ideas out into the wider collective conversation of our time, and not just preach to the already converted!<br><br><a href=#c2047447997498696749 title="comment permalink">5/7/10, 10:21 PM</a><br><br>

I have no doubt that a dark side will emerge in this movement also.”<br><br>This is such an incredibly important observation and one that is usually so difficult to make without having the discussion become entangled in the politics of the immediate situation.<br><br>Good and Evil, Left and Right, Capitalist and Socialist, Leisure and productive classes, Christianity and --bad guy of the month--. This pattern shows itself throughout history. Somebody somewhere proposes a solution to an pressing set of problems, but over time the solution never quite manifests itself as described. Soon, no matter whether we think ourselves on the side of “right” we find ourselves seemingly magically on the side of “wrong” with no real idea of how we got there.<br><br>I describe this as proceeding from the manifestation of a type of mind. Calling it opportunistic or separatist or predatory or sociopathic or carnivorous may help to define its type of “structure”. However naming and defining and studying any aspect of it hides the multiplicity of outward forms that it can (and has) assumed. So for your own good ignore this paragraph.<br><br>All you can be sure of is that if a group of people come together with a goal or goals in common, eventually this type of mind will manifest itself and begin to subvert the group towards other goals. Ponerology might on the face of it sound like it offers a method of understanding the phenomena. Maybe so, but remember that ponerologists are also a group with a goal. As indeed in a broader sense is a civilisation.<br><br>Over the centuries many forests have died to provide the paper required to capture the thoughts of people who have noticed this phenomena in action. However since I'm inclined to believe that E.H Carr is correct in proposing that what we call history is more an interpretation of the perceiving eyes of the historian and of the reader, than a description of actual events, I suggest we go easy on thinking that any record from the past will provide adequate responses in the present.<br><br>I'll offer three (preventative) suggestions of my own that I hope wont do any harm:<br>Be aware of the universality of this phenomenon, but not in a paranoid or fearful way (since paranoia is one of its universal “hooks”).<br>Broaden your own mind (since this broadens your perceptions and range of potential responses) and:<br>(This may be a tricky one to understand) Excessive seriousness and self importance is dangerous. Spontaneous good humour and laughter at the right moment can be “salt to the snail”.<br><br>If prevention fails then “cure” will eventually be applied in one way or another. Try not to be around when this happens as things tend to get broken and people to get hurt.<br><br>Reading back over this it seems a weak response to a very important point, however I'm going to post it anyway, simply because the phenomena is so pervasive.

So many modern problems arose from <i>too smart</i> pursuits of problems. Just forget about managing problems for everyone, more or less. There is enough irony in enforced locality of problem solution.<br><br>I am less sarcastic towards Greece. With all that talk about profligate spending, there is little perspective how exceptional (or not) that spending is compared with the usual European social-democratic spending before the 1990s, or the American pre-Reagan social spending. How <i>huge</i> are the latest Keynessian measures compared with the military spending, or open-door bailouts of financial monsters? The problem is more on state income part. By now it looks <i>natural</i> that all services must be provided commercially, and taxes for the <i>creative</i> rich must be low. But just 20-30 years ago most services of energy supply, public transportation or communication i the West were state-owned - and somehow the world was turning fine. There was less difference between the West (then) and the Soviet Union than between the West then and now. By now the states have privatized themselves to bare bones (and that process kept their incomes respectable, temporarily obviously), and taxes are that low that all governments are close to broken. We are bailing out irresponsible bankers so that we could borrow from them! <br><br>The states now exist not for citizen, but for old investor wolfs, so that they would have places where to <i>invest</i> their wealth, collect dividends continuously and live nicely. That is the kind of unproductive economy that classical economists (with Adam Smith) tried to resolve. This is particularly clear in Eastern Europe now, where the function of governments is more to oversee debt collection from bubbled out citizen. It's a very drastic global experiment - how much people will bear? The US federal government is an exception for <i>investors</i>, because its military power is basically needed for more violent forms of debt collection. But did you check dire straits of local US governments?<br><br>Whether we want it or not, we have people in big power that will keep making problems and their <i>global solutions</i>.<br><br><a href=#c7125006048580841959 title="comment permalink">5/8/10, 2:03 AM</a><br><br>

I go to Druid Camps several times a year at which we live together on the land and do everything that is needed to make that work from erecting structures such as yurts, to chopping wood, to cooking, to discussing things as a community, to providing support and healing to each other when needed, to sharing songs, poetry and music, to doing deep and powerful magical and spiritual work together that genuinely changes people's lives.<br><br>Doing this provides a strong antidote to being seduced by materialism and the mass media. One of the biggest issues in making changes to your lifestyle is that if no-one else is doing the same it is very difficult to go it alone, whereas if other people share our ideas and provide support it is much easier. I really don't care if I don't fit into the usual social model for 'success' in life ie the big house, rising up the ladder at work etc, it is meaningless to me.

You can plan for natural disasters because those threats will not adapt to your defense and act to break it down. Human aggression is intelligent and will work around your defenses, if the intent is to destroy your property.<br><br>Historically, sedentary farmers have always been vulnerable to aggressors threatening to pillage the land. This would repeatedly happen both within societies and between them: warlike nomadic cultures would form parasitic / predatory relationships with nearby agrarian cultures (think Mongols vs China); likewise, within societies, feudal knights taxing peasant farmers is the same phenomenon only more integrated and permanent.<br><br>My point was that growing annual cereals is more resilient and less risky in this situation than growing a perennial forest garden. This cannot be ignored when considering what type of farming will dominate in our "eco-dreams" of the future... yes I refuse to count on the abolition of violence!<br><br>JMG, you seem to agree and rightly point out that it's a matter of place and situation. Forest gardens definitely have a place, it may be a matter of recognizing where they will succeed and where they will not. And that many places will be somewhere in between, so that it may be worth mixing forest gardening with annual fields in some semi-resilient system. I guess that just brings us to what farmers always did anyway!<br><br>I expect sheltered islands, valleys guarded by mountains as well as hilly regions in general, will favor forest gardening (assuming the climate is right). This could apply to Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Norway, Northern Spain, Switzerland, many parts of the Balkans... just to name some parts of Europe. My own beloved home island, Iceland, is favorable too except for a challenging (but not unworkable) climate.<br><br><a href=#c6343167948871720853 title="comment permalink">5/8/10, 6:03 AM</a><br><br>

We all do it to one extent or another. <br><br>Bootstrapper, good. This is one of the reasons why I focus on things that individuals, families, and communities can do themselves, instead of waiting for the political class to do things for them. <br><br>Das Monde, I certainly don't mean to suggest that Greece has done anything out of the ordinary. They're simply the first to be caught with their trousers around their knees. Plenty of other nations -- the US above all -- have engaged in equally foolhardy fiscal stunts. <br><br>Jason, the essay raised some very solid points that, to my mind, might have received more attention from within the TT movement. The most important was the extent to which TT's almost dogmatic optimism and its reliance on consensus make it likely to duck the more difficult issues we face just now, and do things that make everybody happy rather than doing the things that need to be done. Now of course they covered that point and others in a thick and indigestible coating of Marxist cant, which didn't help the matter, but some of the issues they raised deserved more dialogue than I think they got. <br><br>Anne, you obviously run with some very cool Pagans! Over here, from what I've seen, things are a very mixed bag; there are some very thoughtful and serious people in the Pagan scene, but there are also a lot of "social Pagans" who are pretty much following fashion and nothing more. But then you get that sort of thing in every faith. <br><br>Oskar, I do indeed agree! History suggests that different areas will have dramatically different experiences during the approaching <i>volkerwanderung</i>, and what works in one area may not work at all in another. Traditionally, most peasant cultures put in at least a few tree crops whenever they could, and other perennials are popular as well -- we've got rhubarb and asparagus in our garden, for example. <br><br>So it's always going to be a mix. I wonder how many forest gardeners have given a thought to creating forest gardens that aren't recognizable as such; mixing camouflaged forest gardens into a natural forest might be a very successful strategy in the right area. <br><br>Jose, if what you want is to successfully collaborate with the system in which we live, you're probably reading the wrong blog. The subject I'm discussing is how to deal with the decline and fall of that system. <br><br>Brad, in a sharply finite world inhabited by human beings rather than angels, that's not an experiment that will ever be put to the test. <br><br>Danby, I'm not suggesting trying to publicize Distributism among the legions of get-rich-quick groupies! There are many thousands of people these days interested in alternative ways of thinking about economics, and the vast majority of them have never heard of Distributism -- for that matter, I had no idea there were still people promoting it until you mentioned it here a while back, and I'm pretty well informed on alternative ideas! If Distributists would put some energy into getting their ideas out into the alternative scene, I think you might find more interest than you expect.<br><br><a href=#c1099245966639551837 title="comment permalink">5/8/10, 6:00 PM</a><br><br>

Make a forest garden seem to be natural forest and keep it well hidden. Otherwise it's an extremely risky strategy. In the mid 1800's bushrangers roamed freely through this area, pretty much at will. Before this, the Aboriginals used to flush game out of the hills through the use of fire. I'm not excited to be thought of as game to be flushed out myself.<br><br>Incidentally, a natural eucalypt forest if left un-torched will eventually turn into rain forest as the quality of the soil slowly improves and the shade increases. Unfortunately most large scale bush fires here are started by the hand of man (whether it be accidental or otherwise), few are started by nature. The eucalypts have taken advantage of this situation in a big way over the past 40,000+ years.<br><br>Wordek,<br><br>I remember reading something along these lines in that the US engineers stationed here during and after WWII proposed this exact thing with a canal.

Maybe with rising sea levels nature will take care of this engineering feat for the benefit of everyone (unless of course you happen to live in the path of the flood waters!). It's happened in the past when sea levels were much higher anyway.<br><br>With the filling of the Lake (not quite full but very substantially so), I've noticed that it's been wet, cloudy and humid here this year.

And this is the exact reason I'm involved in the Transition Towns (TT) "movement": it <i>is</i> (for me, at least) a holistic response to an insanely unsustainable world system. I begin my TT talks now with a discussion of eco-footprints and how modern civilization has exceeded the biologic capacity of the Earth, and <i>then</i> move on to specific aspects of the problem, such as peak oil and climate change.<br><br>The one sense in which one might say that TTs are anti-holistic is that they are entirely local. But I see that as a strength, insofar as it is based on a recognition that, for most of us, we cannot have meaningful impacts on the world at large -- but we <i>can</i> contribute positively to our little corner of the world.<br><br>I have to share this quick story, as that wonderful Wendell Berry essay really struck a chord with me. Where I live, there are a number of other "environmental"-type groups, including a Buy Fresh, Buy Local organization. They resolutely refuse to work with us on anything unless it explicitly has to do with local farming. Now, I can understand not wanting to spread one's energy too thinly, but that's as far as my sympathy extends. And they're not the only such organization to refuse to partner if it was outside their little (yet important) jurisdiction. I've tried to explain my understanding, which is that "all these things are organically connected; one quickly finds that if one pulls on the food system, it pulls on issues of energy, waste, water, etc.", but that gets me <b>nowhere</b>. It's really frustrating. Actually, it's really absurd.<br><br>@ JMG,<br><br>I hope you don't mind if I continue the conversation. As far as TT's "dogmatic optimism," I find myself in moderate agreement with you. Fortunately, since I take orders from no one (vis-à-vis Transition), it's been easy for me to mix optimism with realism. One phrase I like now I got from an essay by Herman Daly, which goes something like this: "I have to talk about the darkness, because unless I do so you'll have no way to see the small candles of hope I light before the false dawn of fantasy 'solutions.' " So I take people down a path into what's wrong and then back to where we might conceivably go. It's a dim light of hope, to be sure, but it's light nonetheless.<br><br>...having said that, I don't actually think TT is "dogmatically optimistic." TT is trying to make use of an understanding of human psychology that people don't respond well to incessant negativism and need positive alternatives to work towards, not simply horrific apocalypses to run from.<br><br>To your other point about our general "touchiness" (not your words), I simply shrug. You have to expect that passionate people will be passionately defensive. It's not always pretty, but good things often come from conflict. <br><br>Alright, I've abused your comment form enough for one day!<br><br><a href=#c2053925315249518829 title="comment permalink">5/10/10, 11:28 AM</a><br><br>

Since the continent hasn't had historical urban civilizations, there's little to tell us how the future might play out there. Australia might simply be unable to support long-term civilizations! Due to the lack of nutrients in the soil, that is. It might just stay a rather peaceful place, if the human cultures there turn out to be too ecologically limited to invest any surplus in fighting each other.<br><br><br>Kevin,<br><br>Obviously I swear by the influence of geography too, no point denying that!<br><br>I would disagree with your evaluation of the San Francisco area. A forested coastal region sheltered by a significant mountain range, such as the US West Coast, makes for a stable and peaceful place rather than not. It may see a period of invasions and migrations for a while, even from the other side of the Pacific as JMG once suggested in a story. But in the long term I'd expect it to be a safe and prosperous region.<br><br>My rough guess at the cultural landscape of the US 800 years from now: I imagine the Mid-West inhabited by warlike horse-riding nomads herding cattle. They frequently raid urban civilizations to the south - populous and advanced cities of Mexico - and to the east - towns and cities in a trading network running from the Great Lakes down the Mississippi to the Mexican Gulf. Both the west and east coasts are connected to the inland cultures but are sheltered from the aggression and prosper.<br><br>The description above is to some extent what North America probably looked like before Europeans came. There will be fundamental differences however - future America will have horses, which will make the Great Plains cultures a much greater threat to nearby sedentary cultures. Which again forces those cultures to organize themselves better to defend their land, promoting more sophisticated states. Under those circumstances, Mississippians are in a similar geographic situation as medieval Russians were, and might develop similarly autocratic, fortified city states to cope.<br><br>Future America will also inherit better sailing technology, which can make for much greater interaction within the Caribbean and the coasts of the Pacific and Atlantic, compared to ancient pre-Columbian America.<br><br><a href=#c5125017748847053995 title="comment permalink">5/11/10, 3:00 AM</a><br><br>

Wendell Berry's view of human nature and humankind's capacity for collective wisdom and benevolence is a far, far sunnier one than mine. Despite that, he does make some excellent points about the sources of corruption in any movement.<br><br>@ Tony<br><br>I think you may have misunderstood me. I certainly don't seek eternal salvation, and I agree that there is no surety or permanence to be found here. Nor do I mean to criticize your goal of preserving diversity, or most of your other goals and aims. <br><br>Wherein we differ is probably something much more basic: trust, or faith. You seem to me to trust, or believe, that people working together across the globe can bring about significant changes for the better. I think that they can't, no matter how great the need, except on the tiniest of scales, no larger than a small neighborhood. <br> <br>Also, you seem to be an optimist, a hopeful, passionate and enthusiastic person. I deeply mistrust hope, passion and enthusiasm, having seen (1) that they cloud my own ability to assess whatever situation I find myself in and (2) that I do not need them to motivate my own actions in response to that situation. <br><br>So it seems important to me to caution others against the damage that optimism, hope, passion and enthusiasm can do. Among other things, they can easily lead to too much seriousness and self-importance. Humor, joy and empathy are safer guides, I think, than hope and passion.<br><br>And I took away a different lesson than you from Berry's essay, if you think that he distrusts movements mostly because "they are neither holistic nor radical enough." Those are important points, but his distrust seems to cut significantly deeper than that, touching the extent to which humans are even capable of working together on a large scale to improve their lot.<br><br><a href=#c3404169493777662292 title="comment permalink">5/11/10, 9:09 AM</a><br><br>

This observation has been around for a while and people keep rediscovering it and describing it in different ways. The model I use to remind myself that we have a “flawed” reality-information interface is based on the idea of translation. For instance “out there” is “stuff”, light hits stuff and bounces into my eyes – one translation- the receptors at the back of my eyes catch the light and turn it into electrical impulses in my optic nerves – two translations- these impulses register in the wibbly-wobbly thing I use to stop my hat falling on the ground – three translations – my wibbly-wobbly thing animates the jiggly-wiggly things on the end of my arms to create little marks on a screen – four translations- etc etc until the information reaches the wibbly-wobbly thing under your hat.<br><br>The way to mark the point at which a translation occurs is to check that the format that carries the information changes (transforming the information) in one way or another.

What I was trying to get across was that much of what we call increasing complexity in society is really complexity moved around through intermediation. North American households of a hundred years ago were far more complex than those of today because they performed a far more complex set of functions. These included producing food (even most houses in towns had kitchen gardens and flocks of chickens), employing the poor (the U.S. Census of 1900 defined a lower middle class household as one with fewer than three full time live-in domestic servants), manufacturing clothing from purchased cloth, providing entertainment and caring for elderly and disabled family members. These functions were vital to the economy but they were not measurable through the daily and yearly flow of money but only through clumsy tools such as the Census if at all. In that sense, they were invisible to people trying to look at the whole picture. The absorbtion of these functions into the money economy through intermediation simplified household life to the point where the comedian George Carlin could get a laugh of recognition by saying "You don't live in your house; your stuff lives in your house." Once monetized, the complexity became far easier to measure and thus came to the attention of policymakers and researchers, who thought they were seeing something new.<br><br>This sort of "invisible" complexity is the reason I don't see the choice "to abandon business as usual and accept a degree of austerity and limitation very few people find congenial these days" as "the simpler option" compared with, say, trying to keep a national economy afloat on bubbles or drilling for oil 5000 feet under the famously turbulent Gulf of Mexico. Changing a culture so that its members will accept the necessary degree of austerity and limitation is an extremely complex task. Not impossible; if you can find one of the few surviving WWII-era "Rosie the Riveter" type female defense workers, she might be able to tell you about the cultural changes, deliberately brought about by government and industry leaders, that made their work acceptable during the war and then unacceptable once it was over and there were returning soldiers to employ. However, the U.S. culture of those times was a model of top-down control compared to what we have today. Further, these cultural changes might have repercussions, most obviously in the area of consumer demand, that would ripple out through the economy in unpredictable ways. To those whose task is the management of an entire civilization, economic bubbles and oil wells in mile-deep seawater might well look like the simpler option.<br><br><a href=#c3513879170804330473 title="comment permalink">5/15/10, 5:06 PM</a><br><br>

So the argument about complexity is a non-starter for me. In fact I believe that we need to reward everyone for attempts to understand the complexity of their environment and to make decisions that minimize the impact of their lives on that environment. It does not matter if that set of activities makes things more complex for that individual - so be it.<br>Alan Page<br><br><a href=#c2323187525769841595 title="comment permalink">5/16/10, 3:35 AM</a><br><br>
