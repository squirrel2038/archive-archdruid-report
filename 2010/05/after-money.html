The discussion of the risks of complexity in the last few posts here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i> dealt in large part with abstract concepts, though the news headlines did me the favor of providing some very good examples of those concepts in action. Still, it’s time to review some of the practical implications of the ideas presented here, and in the process, begin wrapping up the discussion of economics that has been central to this blog’s project over the last year and a half.<br><br>The news headlines once again have something to contribute. I think most of my readers will be aware that the economic troubles afflicting Europe came within an ace of causing a major financial meltdown last week. The EU, with billions in backing from major central banks around the globe, managed to stave off collapse for now, but it’s important to realize that the rescue package so hastily cobbled together will actually make things worse in the not-very-long run. Like the rest of the industrial world, the EU is drowning in excess debt; the response of the EU’s leadership is to issue even more debt, so they can prop up one round of unpayable debts with another. They’re in good company; Japan has been doing this continuously since its 1990 stock market and real estate collapse, and the US has responded to its current economic nosedive in exactly the same way.<br><br>It’s harsh but not, I think, unfair to characterize this strategy as trying to put out a house fire by throwing buckets of gasoline onto the blaze. Still, a complex history and an even more complex set of misunderstandings feeds this particular folly. Nobody in Europe has forgotten what happened the last time a major depression was allowed to run its course unchecked by government manipulation, and every European nation has its neofascist fringe parties who are eager to play their assigned roles in a remake of that ghastly drama. That’s the subtext behind the EU-wide effort to talk tough about austerity while doing as little as possible to make it happen, and the even wider effort to game the global financial system so that Europe and America can continue to consume more than they produce, and spend more than they take in, for at least a little longer.<br><br>There was a time, to be sure, when this wasn’t as daft an idea as it has now become. During the 350 years of the industrial age, a good fraction of Europe did consume more than it produced, by the simple expedient of owning most of the rest of the world and exploiting it for their own economic benefit. As late as 1914, the vast majority of the world’s land surface was either ruled directly from a European capital, occupied by people of European descent, or dominated by European powers through some form of radically unequal treaty relationship. The accelerating drawdown of fossil fuels throughout that era shifted the process into overdrive, allowing the minority of the Earth’s population who lived in Europe or the more privileged nations of the European diaspora – the United States first among them – not only to adopt what were, by the standards of all other human societies, extravagantly lavish lifestyles, but to be able to expect that those lifestyles would become even more lavish in the future.<br><br>I don’t think more than a tiny fraction of the people of the industrial world has yet begun to deal with the hard fact that those days are over. European domination of the globe came apart explosively in the four brutal decades between 1914, when the First World War broke out, and 1954, when the fall of French Indochina put a period on the age of European empire. The United States, which inherited what was left of Europe’s imperial role, never achieved the level of global dominance that European nations took for granted until 1914 – compare the British Empire, which directly ruled a quarter of the Earth’s land surface, with the hole-and-corner arrangements that allow America to maintain garrisons in other people’s countries around the world. Now the second and arguably more important source of Euro-American wealth and power – the exploitation of half a billion years of prehistoric sunlight in the form of fossil fuels – has peaked and entered on its own decline, with consequences that bid fair to be at least as drastic as those that followed the shattering of the Pax Europa in 1914.<br><br>To make sense of all this, it’s important to recall a distinction made here several times in the past, between the primary, secondary, and tertiary economies. The primary economy is the natural world, which produces around 3/4 of all economic value used by human beings. The secondary economy is the production of goods and services from natural resources by human labor. The tertiary economy is the production and exchange of money – a term that includes everything that has value only because it can be exchanged for the products of the primary and secondary economies, and thus embraces everything from gold coins to the most vaporous products of today’s financial engineering.<br><br>The big question of conventional economics is the fit between the secondary and tertiary economies. It’s not at all hard for these to get out of step with each other, and the resulting mismatch can cause serious problems. When there’s more money in circulation than there are goods and services for the money to buy, you get inflation; when the mismatch goes the other way, you get deflation; when the mechanisms that provide credit to business enterprises gum up, for any number of reasons, you get a credit crunch and recession, and so on. In extreme cases, which used to happen fairly often until the aftermath of the Great Depression pointed out what the cost could be, several of these mismatches could hit at once, leaving both the secondary and tertiary economies crippled for years at a time.<br><br>This is the sort of thing that conventional economic policy is meant to confront, by fiddling with the tertiary economy to bring it back into balance with the secondary economy. The reason why the industrial world hasn’t had a really major depression since the end of the 1930s, in turn, is that the methods cobbled together by governments to fiddle with the tertiary economy work tolerably well. It’s become popular in recent years to insist that the unfettered free market is uniquely able to manage economic affairs in the best possible way, but such claims fly in the face of all the evidence of history; the late 19th century, for example, when the free market was as unfettered as it’s possible for a market to get, saw catastrophic booms and busts sweep through the industrial world with brutal regularity, causing massive disruption to economies around the world. Those who think this is a better state of affairs than the muted ebbs and flows of the second half of the twentieth century should try living in a Depression-era tarpaper shack on a dollar a day for a week or two.<br><br>The problem we face now is that the arrangements evolved over the last century or so only address the relationship between the secondary and tertiary economies. The primary economy of nature, the base of the entire structure, is ignored by most contemporary economics, and has essentially no place in the economic policy of today’s industrial nations. The assumption hardwired into nearly all modern thought is that the economic contributions of the primary economy will always be there so long as the secondary and tertiary economy are working as they should. This may just be the Achilles’ heel of the entire structure, because it means that mismatches between the primary economy and the other two economies not only won’t be addressed – they won’t even be noticed.<br><br>This, I suspect, is what underlies the rising curve of economic volatility of the last decade or so: we have reached the point where the primary economy of nature will no longer support the standards of living most people in the industrial world expect. Our politicians and economists are trying to deal with the resulting crises as though they were purely a product of mismatches between the secondary and tertiary economies. Since such measures don’t address the real driving forces behind the crises, they fail, or at best stave off trouble for a short time, at the expense of making it worse later on.<br><br>The signals warning us that we have overshot the capacity of the primary economy are all around us. The peaking of world conventional oil production in 2005 is only one of these. The dieoff of honeybees is another, on a different scale; whatever its cause, it serves notice that something has gone very wrong with one of the natural systems on which human production of goods and services depends. There are many others. It’s easy to dismiss any of them individually as irrelevancies, but every one of them has an economic cost, and every one of them serves notice that the natural systems that make human economic activity possible are cracking under the strain we’ve placed on them.<br><br>That prospect is daunting enough. There’s another side to our predicament, though, because the only tools governments have available these days to deal with economic trouble are ways of fiddling with the tertiary economy. When those tools don’t work – and these days, increasingly, they don’t – the only option policy makers can think of is to do more of the same, following what’s been called the “lottle” principle – “if a little doesn’t work, maybe a lot’ll do the trick.” The insidious result is that the tertiary economy of money is moving ever further out of step with the secondary economy of goods and services, yielding a second helping of economic trouble on top of the one already dished out by the damaged primary economy. Flooding the markets with cheap credit may be a workable strategy when a credit crunch has hamstrung the secondary economy; when what’s hitting the secondary economy is the unrecognized costs of ecological overshoot, though, flooding the markets with cheap credit simply accelerates economic imbalances that are already battering economies around the world.<br><br>One interesting feature of this sort of two-sided crisis is that it’s not a unique experience. Most of the past civilizations that overshot the ecological systems that supported them, and crashed to ruin as a result, backed themselves into a similar corner. I’ve mentioned here several times the way that the classic Lowland Maya tried to respond to the failure of their agricultural system by accelerating the building programs central to their religious and political lives. Their pyramids of stone served the same purpose as our pyramids of debt: they systematized the distribution of labor and material wealth in a way that supported the social structure of the Lowland Mayan city-states and the <i>ahauob</i> or “divine kings” who ruled them. Yet building more pyramids was not an effective response to topsoil loss; in fact, it worsened the situation considerably by using up labor that might have gone into alternative means of food production.<br><br>An even better example, because a closer parallel to the present instance, is the twilight of the Roman world. Ancient Rome had a sophisticated economic system in which credit and government stimulus programs played an important role. Roman money, though, was based strictly on precious metals, and the economic expansion of the late Republic and early Empire was made possible only because Roman armies systematically looted the wealth of most of the known world. More fatal still was the shift that replaced a sustainable village agriculture across most of the Roman world with huge slave-worked <i>latifundiae</i>, the industrial farms of their day, which were treated as cash cows by absentee owners and, in due time, were milked dry. The primary economy cracked as topsoil loss caused Roman agriculture to fail; attempts by emperors to remedy the situation failed in turn, and the Roman government was reduced to debasing the coinage in an attempt to meet a rising spiral of military costs driven by civil wars and barbarian invasions. This made a bad situation worse, gutting the Roman economy and making the collapse of the Empire that much more inevitable.<br><br>It’s interesting to note the aftermath. In the wake of Rome’s fall, lending money at interest – a normal business practice throughout the Roman world – came to a dead stop for centuries. Christianity and Islam, the majority religions across what had been the Empire’s territory, defined it as a deadly sin. More, money itself came to play an extremely limited role in large parts of the former Empire. Across Europe in the early Middle Ages, it was common for people to go from one year to the next without so much as handling a coin. What replaced it was the use of labor as the basic medium of exchange. That was the foundation of the feudal system, from top to bottom: from the peasant who held his small plot of farmland by providing a fixed number of days of labor each year in the local baron’s fields, to the baron who held his fief by providing his overlord with military service, the entire system was a network of personal relationships backed by exchanges of labor for land.<br><br>It’s common in contemporary economic history to see this as a giant step backward, but there’s good reason to think it was nothing of the kind. The tertiary economy of the late Roman world had become a corrupt, metastatic mess; the new economy of feudal Europe responded to this by erasing the tertiary economy as far as possible, banishing economic abstractions, and producing a system that was very hard to game – deliberately failing to meet one’s feudal obligations was the one unforgivable crime in medieval society, and generally risked the prompt and heavily armed arrival of one’s liege lord and all his other vassals. The thought of Goldman Sachs executives having to defend themselves in hand-to-hand combat against a medieval army may raise smiles today, a thousand years ago, that’s the way penalties for default were most commonly assessed.<br><br>What makes this even more worth noting is that very similar systems emerged in the wake of other collapses of civilizations. The implosion of Heian Japan in the tenth century, to name only one example, gave rise to a feudal system so closely parallel to the European model that it’s possible to translate much of the technical language of Japanese bushido precisely into the equivalent jargon of European chivalry, and vice versa. More broadly, when complex civilizations fall apart, one of the standard results is the replacement of complex tertiary economies with radically simplified systems that do away with abstractions such as money, and replace them with concrete economics of land and labor.<br><br>There’s a lesson here, and it can be applied to the present situation. As the rising spiral of economic trouble continues, we can expect drastic volatility in the value and availability of money – and here again, remember that this term refers to <i>any</i> form of wealth that only has value because it can be exchanged for something else. Any economic activity that is solely a means of bringing in money will be held hostage to the vagaries of the tertiary economy, whether those express themselves through inflation, credit collapse, or what have you. Any economic activity that produces goods and services directly for the use of the producer, and his or her family and community, will be much less drastically affected by these vagaries. If you depend on your salary to buy vegetables, for example, how much you can eat depends on the value of money at any given moment; if you grow your own vegetables, using your own kitchen and garden scraps to fertilize the soil and saving your own seed, you have much more direct control over your vegetable supply.<br><br>Most people won’t have the option of separating themselves completely from the money economy for many years to come; as long as today’s governments continue to function, they will demand money for taxes, and money will continue to be the gateway resource for many goods and services, including some that will be very difficult to do without. Still, there’s no reason why distancing oneself from the tertiary economy has to be an all-or-nothing thing. Any step toward the direct production of goods and services for one’s own use, with one’s own labor, using resources under one’s own direct control, is a step toward the world that will emerge after money; it’s also a safety cushion against the disintegration of the money economy going on around us – a point I’ll discuss in more detail, by way of a concrete example, in next week’s post.

It's so often used in an antagonistic way suggesting that the person or people in question know but are refusing to admit to or act on their knowledge. It occurred to me that often people had no knowledge to admit to or act upon in the first place and what they had was in fact a form of naivety. <br><br>After reading the part of your post that I quoted above I had a related thought - that the prime movers and shakers of modern economics are not ignorant of the "natural" world that supplies as you say three-quarters of all goods and services used and abused by us: they are actually barely aware of its existence. At least in any way tangible to them. And unfortunately unless they start taking LSD and going for walks in the forest I don't think they'll be appreciating it any time soon.<br><br><a href=after-money.html#c3836923561944016635 title="comment permalink">5/12/10, 10:16 PM</a><br><br>

Recent impetus has been given to food security, of re-establishing local - say, within a few dozens of miles - production of the bulk of food consumed by a neighborhood or community. Distribution of this locally produced food or other product would seem to be a secondary economic activity, but to the producer a primary activity.<br><br>The other thought that comes to mind is with regard to child rearing. When I grew up, parents were encouraged to give their children an allowance, to learn money handling skills. Often the chores assigned to children within the family became paid piece-work, rather than a combination of (primary) exchange of efforts for the common good and essential apprenticeship efforts intended to build character, body strength, and various skills. I suspect a discerning parent should be downplaying the "paid labor" aspect, the secondary economy aspect of allowances, and emphasizing primary aspects ("Do it or you will be punished.")<br><br>Does economic descent mean that apprenticeships will be a better choice, economically, than technical schools and universities, for adults as well as for raising our young?<br><br><a href=after-money.html#c417579039046968318 title="comment permalink">5/12/10, 11:35 PM</a><br><br>

Please read the Peoples' Agreement or the Cochabamba Accord as a response to the Copenhagen Accord. It is a summary of the conclusions of the 17 Working Groups and acknowledges indigenous vision and wisdom which addresses "the primary economy of nature" as the "Rights of Mother Earth", a whole different consciousness of the sacredness of Mother Earth and value system of "living well" ) el buen vivir rather than the paradigm of never-ending economic growth. I think, we in the developed industrialized world, who is causing our climate crisis - such as the melting of the Andean and Himalayian glaciers - should align ourselves with this new world movement for the rights of Mother Earth - a movement from the bottom up rather than top down UN nation state response.

It's a simple, convenient technology that makes a lot of sense. Basing a currency on something like precious metal makes sense because it is rare and non-consumable. Gold can't be faked and getting it takes a lot of work to produce. The problem now is that money is not based on rare materials, or even cheap materials like paper, but instead a bunch of numbers in a computer. Its easy to just tack on a few zeros, and highly beneficial to the people in a position to create those zeros. <br><br>That said, I think the most valuable possession in the future will clearly be land. It is the basis of productive capacity, without which money is ultimately meaningless. I think more people are coming to this realization and hopefully it results in better stewardship of the soils, waters, atmosphere and lifeforms of our world. <br><br>- bromius<br><br>(I really enjoy your writings, thanks to Olafr at peakoil.com for giving it a plug.)<br><br><a href=after-money.html#c3679151774564699003 title="comment permalink">5/13/10, 4:50 AM</a><br><br>

Mainstream media has been discussing the rise of China for a long time now, after all.<br><br>Still, I suspect the West's awareness of its potential vulnerability is shallow. People are looking to China as the next "upstart", at best a worthy challenger comparable to the old USSR. The thought that Europe and North America might gradually just become distant corners of the world of little concern to people living in other continents seems impossible - it's so hard to grasp that many Westerners fail to understand that that's precisely what Europe *was* until 1500 AD.<br><br>This is how I explain it to people in brief: "A hundred years ago, we [the West] ruled the world through undisputable superiority in industry, technology, military and access to energy. Today we no longer have the industry or the energy and only the semblance of military strength. We make a whole lot of paper however, while the real industrial nations in Asia patiently co-operate as long as Western paper can be exchanged for real, physical, resources for their industries."<br><br>The stage has been set for a rapid collapse of the West, because the current facade of Western wealth no longer reflects where the resources are and who's making things out of them. All it takes is a bit of disbelief. That's precisely where the current pressures on the financial system are taking us.<br><br>The condition of the US military is vital in this situation. It can be expected to enforce the current Western order, but its ability to do so has been visibly waning in the past years. That's why upstart Latin American leaders like Hugo Chavez can stay in power and behave in ways they could never have done 30 years ago. The current wars of occupation, along with peak oil, are gradually sapping the strength of the US warmachine. As its weaknesses develop and are revealed, more leaders will dare to challenge the current system until we reach an eventual tipping point.<br><br>Personally I expect that tipping point will come within then next 20 years.<br><br>In a larger context, the decline of the West is a big first step in the decline of industrial civilization. Even if China becomes the new Great Power, it cannot hope to project its power the way that Westerners did through the 20th century. Rather, it becomes the top dog in the new Age of Scarcity, as JMG defines it.<br><br><a href=after-money.html#c8921572079529372667 title="comment permalink">5/13/10, 5:46 AM</a><br><br>

You're quite right, of course; for most of the people who play a significant role in modern economics, nature is something that exists off somewhere else, for the purpose of recreation. <br><br>Onion, I don't think all the ignorance is willful by a long shot. To grasp the role of ecological overshoot in our economic troubles requires a revolution in our thinking and the abandonment of some of the most unquestioned assumptions of modern life. <br><br>Brad, gardening is a secondary economy activity -- it uses human labor to produce goods -- but it relies intimately on the primary economy of topsoil, earthworms, seed stocks, and the like. As for apprenticeships, absolutely -- the careers that will make any kind of sense in the near future are those that involve actually making goods and providing services for people, not manipulating abstractions for governments or businesses. <br><br>Ramps, that's a good metaphor. The question is how soon the bomb goes off!<br><br>Matthijs, Galbraith's <i>A Short History of Financial Euphoria</i> and Charles Kindleberger's <i>Manias, Panics, and Crashes</i> are good places to read up on this. <br><br>Robin, if everything you've ever been taught tells you that human beings are the effective center of the cosmos, and everything else is just a passive backdrop for some grand story or other of human progress, then the primary economy is utterly invisible -- and the possibility that it might not provide you with whatever you happen to need from it will never enter your darkest dream. <br><br>Disillusioned, thank you! Yes, I'm rather enamored of the thought of Goldman Sachs executives trying to parry battle-axes with briefcases.<br><br>Michael, no doubt money will exist in some limited form, but you ought to take some time and read up on just how minor a role it's had in times of the sort we're entering. While it has advantages, it also has crippling disadvantages, and when the latter outweigh the former, it's remarkable how fast people find ways to do without it. <br><br>Phil, exactly. Add physical limits to the mix, and you've got a profoundly unstable situation in which monetary wealth is still ballooning while the actual, physical wealth to back it up is dwindling. Eventually something has to give. <br><br>Oskar, exactly. Just as the US empire is much less powerful than the British Empire was, the Chinese empire will be weaker than ours, and may consist of nothing more than a very strong navy, a network of naval bases scattered around the globe, and a military presence in a few crucial areas. <br><br>Armando, during the early Middle Ages a great many feudal lords had little more use for money than the peasants who worked their fields; labor-for-land exchanges and in-house production took care of nearly everything. (Your ordinary tenth-century baroness spent nearly as much time spinning and sewing as did the wives of the local peasants.) Only with the return of long-distance trade and the rise of mercantile classes in the resurgent cities did money start to come back into vogue. <br><br>Tony, I'm very much of two minds about local currencies. Much depends on whether they can be gamed by speculators, even on a small scale.<br><br><a href=after-money.html#c5863951384884963391 title="comment permalink">5/13/10, 7:25 AM</a><br><br>

Coins from older times and far-away places continued to circulate, but they had only a historic "face value," which had no bearing on what you could buy with the coin. (Often enough, the face value was in some language like Greek or Arabic, which even the nobles and most of the clergy couldn't read.) <br><br>The actual value of medieval coins was usually determined by the weight of precious metal in each individual coin. This could be affected by clipping, and also by several less easily detectable kinds of alteration. <br><br>Thus, the Medieval hoards of coin that have been found in our times usually mingle coins with lots of scrap precious metals and with raw bullion. (An ounce of gold is an ounce of gold, whether it is a coin, a part of a coin, or a broken piece of a dead king's crown.)<br><br>This state of affairs lasted, in the Americas, well into the early 19th century, where silver coins of a certain weight were often cut into eight equal parts, or "bits," and each "bit" could be a unit of exchange according to its actual weight. (Hence the old slogan, "two bits, four bits, six bits, a dollar.")<br><br>So the admitted convenience of money as a medium of exchange certainly wasn't enough to ensure the continuance of money (as money, not as such-and-such a weight of precious metal). I expect that this pattern will repeat itself within the coming century.<br><br><a href=after-money.html#c6709437204537274645 title="comment permalink">5/13/10, 8:13 AM</a><br><br>

It was not for loss of fertility that they weren't farmed; it was due to crushing taxes that farmers could not pay, even under threat (and use) of force.

What replaced it was the use of labor as the basic medium of exchange. That was the foundation of the feudal system, from top to bottom:"<br><br>Nature, red in tooth and claw to quote Alfred Lord Tennyson. By replacing currency with labour as a unit of exchange, people are actually rejoining the primary economy which is in effect an acknowledgement that we are all animals and no amount of technology can separate us from the natural world. What is also implicit, but left unsaid in your quote above is that those people that do not work, simply do not eat under such a system. <br><br>It is an unpleasant truth that in the animal world, the very young, the very old and the very sick become food for another part of the nutrient recycling system. I always wonder how many people in an industrial society are actually up for a hard day of manual work, knowing that they may have to get up the next day and repeat it?<br><br>The most efficient human enterprise is that which is up to but not quite at the point of requiring a supervisor. As this tipping point is surpassed a production surplus is required to support this individual (or group thereof). These guys are the passengers in any system and they will hang onto their perquisites at all costs. They have always been around our society and will continue to be so in the future.<br><br>The unfortunate side of the feudal system is that the feudal lord could demand an amount from their serfs that was in excess of a reasonable surplus. Enlightened dictatorships are few and far between whilst greed and laziness seem to be quite common.<br><br>I suspect the feudal system will provide it's fair share of ups and downs for any population.

Several actually. The people who wind up on top of any societal collapse are always the military elite on the winning side under the old regime. Virtually all European titles of nobility are derived from Roman army officer ranks, for instance, and virtually every royal house is descended from either a tribal chieftain who beat the local Roman garrison, or the commander of the local garrison who took control when it seemed Rome was no longer in a position to enforce it's will.<br><br>So if you want your descendants to rise to the top of the possible future social structure, get them into one of the military academies.

It would however, make for a fascinating historical study. Over the years, I've negotiated non standard work arrangements with employers, but I can assure you that it is given grudgingly and they don't like you for it, even if it's in their financial interests. Very strange... To do anything remotely different from the societal norm places you on the fringe. Ever noticed that vegetarians are not out and proud? I think they are reviled so much because they hold a mirror up to people and those people don't like what they see. An alternative perspective is that people view difference as a threat.<br><br>In an agricultural society as you quite rightly point out work revolves around the seasons and crops so the time spent working is sporadic and this practice continues even today, even with our longer growing seasons due to climate change. They actually have a lot more down time and the result is that they tend to have a stronger community, local knowledge and hands on skills.<br><br>The life of peasants in a feudal system has always been portrayed in a negative light so it is interesting that you say that their working conditions were actually not too bad.<br><br>I do think that you glossed over my point that once an industrial society declines, it will actually be survival of the fittest (or those with access to the most resources). I'm not personally excited about this, but it seems like a common sense outcome as medical care is drastically cut back. Many weeks ago someone on this blog pointed out that simple accidents will become life threatening, well the same is true for disease. Cholera was only eradicated in Melbourne a bit over 100 years ago and we have an amazing sewerage infrastructure as a result.<br><br>A good barometer for the status of a society is it's treatment of human wastes. The technology and understanding is out there to process it in a manner which has positive outcomes for the environment, but most people give little thought to this. However, if the power was lost to the main sewer pumps, next to the food and water supply it would be of immediate concern to most people!<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><a href=after-money.html#c9150684852619998887 title="comment permalink">5/15/10, 2:01 AM</a><br><br>

Whether those goggles are rose tinted or not is another matter. I hope this clarification has value ;)<br><br>H Cherokee<br>“An alternative perspective is that people view difference as a threat.”<br><br>In “steps to an ecology of mind”, Gregory Bateson defines difference as the basic unit of information. ( I would also add unit of perception to that). In a clock regulated binary system (what you are looking at now), that which counts as a signal is not so much the 0 or 1, but the change (or lack of change at a particular clock tick) between the two values.<br><br>We cant help but notice difference, and in a sensory deprivation tank what we are being deprived of is not sensory information (our senses are still functioning), but the usual ongoing flood of “news of difference”.<br><br>How responses to difference are generated, either with aggression, opportunism or dismissal etc is another phenomena, however:<br>I made a point in an earlier comment about hiding being a good skill to have. I think survival of the fittest may not be the ultimate rule when “times are interesting”. I have a feeling that survival of the blandest might fit into the picture quite well also. <br>Perhaps in the anti-spirit of non-Darwinism we could call it “The Law of Natural Un-Selection”<br>And dont fight habgards law.

'Many thanks' to everyone posting here over the past few months - this is very useful stuff.<br>A couple of observations:<br>'Money' is not just a 'medium of exchange' but has a function as a 'store of value'. In other words I use it to ensure that I will still be able to eat when I'm sick, on vacation or old. Simple barter does not provide for this. A LETS system may work. Otherwise I have to rely on friends, family, friendly society, charity. <br>Two words not used explicitly here very often are 'equity' and 'justice'. I need to ensure that my feudal lord does not tax me too harshly. In England in feudal times a large proportion of the land was subject to 'commoners rights' - the local peasants could use it in various ways for their own benefit. These rights were stolen and nowadays city money is buying up land, although they often don't use it to grow food. Large landowners will be in a position of great power and may well abuse it. There will certainly need to be some political re-alignment.<br><br><a href=after-money.html#c8789882106457891592 title="comment permalink">5/16/10, 2:42 AM</a><br><br>

But of course, in every turn of the tide, the physically as well as mentally fit certainly have an advantage, and mental fitness now means a grasp of the "cooperation" side of that scrum. <br><br>(aside to eric; kudos for caring for your kids, and maybe their best hope involves looking after the neighbors, too. But "me and mine" thinking is one of the over-priveliged behaviors we could all stand to lose.)<br><br>But most of my neighbors' idea of physical fitness involves wrestling with a machine at the YMCA. Their health club memberships recieve plenty of good-natured grief from me, as I invite them over for a weeding workout or a set of compost-turning reps. Maybe there's some social benefit to being a member of the club; I wouldn't know...<br><br>Our cultural gag-reflex to physical labor rears its prissy head everywhere, even in the otherwise profound body of work now known as Permaculture. All other valid criticisms aside (and there are plenty), every time I come across some P-notion that will "save labor" I just cringe and think, who the hell is reading this, Betty Crocker and white glove brigade? Let's chuck our "labor-saving" psychosis out with the electric can-openers and carpet cleaning robots. Is there a landfill big enough for our over-sized brains?<br><br>Anyone who indulges in any form of work-avoidance will feel they must read every Permaculture book in print before pressing spade to topsoil. And the majority of Permaculture students are primarily engaged in the mental activity of "design exercises" which is, of course, fantasizing by definition. Okay, step one, zone zero.<br><br>The truth is, any of this food-growing business, getting all those hidden food forests to exist, will take an amazing amount of sheer hard work. The Perma-culture's prejudice against the rudimentary row-cropping of annuals also hides this bias against the simple sweat equity required to remedy our various debts of physical and mental bloatation. <br><br>In the temperate climates, any lasting food-supply infrastucture must be grown one step at a time, one growing season at a time. First the annuals come to maturity, then the perennials, then the trees, kind of like natural succession.<br><br>In other words, the path toward any perennial culture must go through the humble garden gate. Full-blown food forests take years longer to appear than their drawings may reveal at first. <br><br>And not having an aversion to manual labor is not going to cut it. That's a double negative, and to git 'er done we have to be doubly POSITIVE. You have to LOVE it, you must actually enjoy getting hot and sweaty and sore and tired and truly productive in order to feel inside the deep satisfaction of being alive on some of your own terms.<br><br>A feeling I recall described in the last two lines of a favorite Wendell Berry poem:<br><br>"Stumblers under a folding sky,<br> the field clear behind us..."<br><br><a href=after-money.html#c942639062079657696 title="comment permalink">5/16/10, 6:29 AM</a><br><br>

It will be interesting to get back to the barter concept, after a lifetime of set prices. There are people who love to haggle (like at garage sales) and those who are grateful for the ability to privately check prices online, then go in to buy. To have to negotiate the price for everything will actually add a layer of complexity, methinks. <br><br>But I do think that’s a very good point about how dropping down to barter (or feudalism) was and could again be an improvement over a tertiary economy gone nuts. I have been feeling a lot of sanity just looking at the growing veggies in my garden, realizing it’s a direct relationship – grow food, eat food… no more hoping the boss likes what I’ve been slaving over in the cubicle. <br><br>And one of the best benefits of dropping out the tertiary economy is that people will be much more face-to-face with the actual value of food, materials, work – as they have to.. not exactly shift priorities, but become much more aware of them (instead of reaching for a cardboard box of food, for example, they will have to plan the garden to have at least a lot of the food they need). What I see is that we have been living in an almost “magic” culture – with cheap, instant goods at hand, many people have lost the sense of relative value – an IPOD is more “valuable” than a sack of rice… <br><br><br>@Hawlkeye <i>Let's chuck our "labor-saving" psychosis out with the electric can-openers and carpet cleaning robots.</i><br><br>I agree it’s gotten out of hand, but saving labor in one area allows one to stretch sometimes meager resources. Possibly they are not prissy, just exhausted! ;-) <br><br><i>you must actually enjoy getting hot and sweaty and sore and tired and truly productive in order to feel inside the deep satisfaction of being alive on some of your own terms.</i><br><br>Not true, actually, though I’m sure it adds to the satisfaction. I’ve always been adverse to sweating and dirty hands (I think it’s a tactile-sensitivity thing) but I still love to garden, and even though I hate feeling all those adjectives above, I feel a deep satisfaction when I’ve wrestled with weeds and won, or when the potato crop is successfully launched, for example.<br><br>I will tell you that once I get my new chicks settled in this “make it up as I go along” henhouse, I will feel a HUGE sense of satisfaction. The exhaustion has already happened! ;-)<br><br>As usual, a great read!

Much to think about. You may have addressed this in the past. I don't recall seeing it mentioned since I started reading, and haven't seen anybody bring this issue up. Assuming that the scenarios you have talked about come about more or less as you have envisioned them, what should a person do as far as their IRA accounts, 401K accounts, etc.? I would assume your answer to be that one should go ahead and cash them out, pay the penalty fee, pay the income taxes, and use the remainder to pay off debt, start purchasing things that will have a useable and long-term service such as hand tools, whatever, etc. etc. Am I right on that, or what has/would be your suggestion? I'm assuming that under the present scenarios that are being worked out, financial accounts are not going to go anywhere but south in the long-term, and probably short-term as well. So, that being the case, there would be no sense in leaving retirement account money wasting away for a future that may never be. If the start of the unraveling was 20 years off, then it might be worth leaving it there, I am 52, but it seemingly looks like now is better than later?<br><br><a href=after-money.html#c8800820487686443167 title="comment permalink">5/17/10, 11:57 AM</a><br><br>

In his ideal world, we live in modern day Tuscan hill towns, with relative self-sufficiency among small, groups of interconnected families. There are no fuedal lords in sight, which may be an over-optimistic view of human nature, but the concept is sound, and I think you would be very interested in his take on the issue: (http://www.jeffvail.net/2006/04/envisioning-hamlet-economy-topology-of.html)<br><br><a href=after-money.html#c3191595402805563225 title="comment permalink">5/17/10, 7:54 PM</a><br><br>

I simply wanted to make a point -- one too often missed these days -- that there are aspects of value that aren't simply a matter of personal preference, except insofar as most people prefer not to starve to death. <br><br>Tom, welcome to the discussion! You're quite right that money functions as a store of value, though that function is breaking down tolerably often these days. One of the hard consequences of the process of decline and fall we're experiencing just now is that every store of value becomes problematic. <br><br>Edde, any object of value that can be picked up and carried off by a Visigoth is a dubious investment in the kind of historical periods that attract Visigoths -- which ours may well become. Skills are a better investment; if you know how to brew good beer, your local Visigoths will trade you all the titanium you want for it. <br><br>Hawlkeye, don't even get me started. My favorite definition of "yuppie logic" is the idea that it makes sense to buy a power lawnmower, and then drive to the gym to get the exercise you could have gotten pushing a push mower -- not to mention walking to the gym! (Yes, I use a push mower, too.) A slogan worth circulating: "Real sustainability makes you sweat." <br><br>Ariel, it's true! Doesn't always work, but it's the first line of defense. <br><br>Nebris, granted. I'd encourage you to balance Sun Tzu with Lao Tsu, though. <br><br>Cathy, the simplest of all economies is the one in which you produce the goods and services you need by your own labor. That's the most sustainable and the most stable of all economies, too. <br><br>Dltrammel, thanks for the link!<br><br>Bill, that's funny. Yes, in fact, from my perspective, those "extraterrestrials" who haven't been invented by assorted air forces are a reflection of the same odd variety of human experience that another age labeled "fairies" and the like. That's hardly a new idea; either -- Jacques Vallee and John Keel were saying the same things when I was a kid. Still, it doesn't matter how often you say something, those who want to hear something else will hear what they want to hear.<br><br>David, in your place I'd cash 'em out, and use the proceeds to get yourself out of debt and get some solid training in useful practical skills -- those are more important and more durable than anything else you can buy. <br><br>Cherokee, I hope that one leaf blower survives the Long Descent and gets put in a museum, so that people a thousand years from now can look at it, shake their heads, and realize what a bunch of wasteful dorks we were. <br><br>Bill, good. I think the difference is that natural complexity evolved gradually over millions of years of ruthless Darwinian weeding; by the time we came around, pretty much all the rough edges were gone. We sauntered in and decided that we could make things work much better by following whatever arbitrary mental and cultural constructs wse thought were the laws of nature, and we've produced quite a number of flops -- though also some successes. Give us another ten million years or so, and we might have things a little better in hand. <br><br>Scott, I do follow Jeff's work. I have my doubts about his theory, as I do about any social or political theory -- as I see it, societies are natural phenomena; they evolve according to their own rules and in their own time, and trying to force them into a mold composed of concepts and theories is normally a recipe for disaster.

However, I am not so sure Peak Oil is going to be such a defining event - I am much more worried about topsoil depletion and global warming, for instance, than about Peak Oil (this may be due to the fact the I live in Europe, which is not as dependent on cars as the United States). <br><br>But this not the reason for this post. I read, a little while ago, "Bad Money" by Kevin Phillips - quite an interesting author in his own right - and a small part of that book made a strong impression on me: the fact that all Empires end up in a disastrous financial crisis, usually brought about by the crushing costs of maintaining military might.<br><br>He also mentions that most empires are fairly dependent on a given energy source: the Dutch used wind power, the British used coal, the Americans, Oil.<br><br>My question for you would therefore be: are you sure the current crisis is not simply due to the end of the American Empire, and to the cost of 'pax americana' as we have known it for the past 50 years? Perhaps, if the USA had turned away from what I call 'the Empire temptation' in the 50s, we would not be having this conversation? (Remember Eisenhower's 'militaro-industrial complex' - a clear warning if there ever was one?)<br><br>Another question would also be: why paint such a rosy picture of the feudal times? After all, there is a reason why these are known as 'The Dark Ages'. They were mostly a period of unrelenting misery and oppression for the vast majority of Europeans (think witch hunting and crusades here)... And isn't it interesting that they also saw the Golden Age of the Moslem world, with civilizations as brilliant as Baghdad and Southern Spain, that were tolerant and open? (within, of course, the religious parameters of the time). <br><br>Not to mention the Chinese civilization, with its own brilliant intellectual and philosophical pursuits, that was so stunning in its successes. You could perhaps say that the wheel has come around, and that, if China is the next world Empire, it may well be it will also be based on a new form of energy (Solar, perhaps?).<br><br>One final question that comes to mind is this: may your 'religion' color your perception of this specific period in European history?<br><br>(As an aside - and I hope you won't be offended by this - I find it deeply ironic, as a European, to see something as essentially 'Celtic' as the druidic religion promoted in North America... What made you decide to follow this faith and its tenets)<br><br>It seems to me - based on your writings - that you value community over, for instance, economic growth. While this point may be debatable (is sustainable economic growth even possible?) are you sure you are not 'projecting' your own desires onto the blank canvas of the future? The future being, by definition, unpredictable, it seems to me that any attempt at defining it ends up in abject failure ('Down Jones 36,000'...?).<br><br>And, finally, as Kevin Phillips mentioned in his book, the end of empire is usually accompanied by extreme religiosity, demands for patriotic behaviour and repression of dissent, and very vocal pessimisim: all these traits can be seen in modern-day America. Ergo, are you sure your predictions, while always interesting and thought-provoking, are not colored by the currently unfolding events?<br><br>I hope the above makes sense, and I'd really appreciate your thoughts.<br><br><a href=after-money.html#c2757584009887219167 title="comment permalink">5/18/10, 5:51 AM</a><br><br>

In general, in biological systems complexity seems to promote stability -- this is true of organisms and ecosystems. Conversely, in political and financial systems, complexity seems to promote instability." I have wondered about that myself.<br><br>I think that the answer lies in the different ways biological and human systems use complexity to gain or limit redundancy. Nature makes countless copies of organisms in countless numbers of species to exploit some incredibly small niches. This redundancy helps ensure that individual species, and life itself will survive. <br><br>Humans on the other hand, try to use complexity to eliminate redundancy wherever possible. For example, we might consolidate a large number of automobile builders and call it General Motors. Or we might hand over selected family or tribal functions to a government. These apparent simplifications, of course, require more complex communications, transportation, financial, and other systems. <br><br>At the end of the day, the natural systems are just as interconnected as human systems, if not more so. But the redundancy ensures that nature can take changes and small shocks in stride. On the other hand, the human systems are built like engines; one tiny part fails and the whole thing stops.<br><br><a href=after-money.html#c5170522473419418265 title="comment permalink">5/18/10, 7:18 AM</a><br><br>

To begin with, I've been talking about the decline and fall of the American empire for a couple of years now. Of course that's a massive factor in the current political and economic situation, but it's taking place against the broader and even more massive background of the end of the age of cheap energy.<br><br>I gather from your comments about the Middle Ages that you haven't researched the subject; the witch burnings, for example, didn't start until the 1370s, which by most standards is on the brink of the Renaissance, and reached their peak in the 1500s and 1600s, when the medieval system was in its grave. As for my faith, well, there again you might want to do a bit more reading; the modern Druid movement was partly inspired by the ancient Celtic Druids (who went extinct long before the Middle Ages, by the way), but it's a modern religious movement that emerged in the 18th and 19th centuries in response to the Industrial Revolution, and it has no particular attachment to the Middle Ages. <br><br>Finally, it's always easy to insist that somebody's predictions of the future must be a reflection of some factor other than a reasoned assessment of the future. So? Your discomfort with my predictions can be explained away by exactly the same argument. I calls 'em as I sees 'em, and so far, at least, my predictions of the near future have come much closer to what's happened than either the business-as-usual model or the we're-all-gonna-die model. <br><br>Caboodle, of course feudalism offends against modern ideas of justice and equality. When I say that it works, I don't mean to say that it's any kind of improvement on the status quo; I mean simply that it works when more centralized systems break down, and provide a rough but functional degree of security and stability. Every human social system includes a great deal of oppression and injustice, ours as much as others; we don't see the human cost of industrial society because we've offshored most of that cost to other countries. One drawback of the future ahead of us is that a lot of that is going to be shipped back home. <br><br>Ariel, look closely at the chives and the grass. Chives are little tubes with pointed ends; they don't have narrow flat blades, the way grass does. Once you get used to the difference, you won't have to worry about pulling them out as weeds!<br><br><a href=after-money.html#c1160895139222972601 title="comment permalink">5/18/10, 7:31 AM</a><br><br>

How do I get me some of those fun times?<br><br>Just tying in to that and an earlier comment about sensory deprivation, I remember once when I was abut 12 walking home from the neighbours house at night. It was literally “cant see your hand” pitch black and I was navigating by memory with one hand brushing against the bank at the side of the road. All of a sudden there was a presence right behind me emanating an incredibly intense malevolence. All the hair I had ( not much at that age) was on end and if you ever read about terror running up and down the spine well I had it bad. I turned to look and I could see a human shape – even though I couldnt see anything else there was a shape right there except it wasnt where I looked, it was always just not quite where my eyes were pointing no matter how I tried to look at it ( does that make sense? – guess it will have to ) <br>I couldnt run since I would have just fallen face first in the rocks and gravel so I just kept walking with that evil hating leering thing just behind me, telling myself over and over it doesnt exist, its all in my mind. At one point it got so close that I just spun and swung my arm through it... ….nothing there. And it followed me until I was close enough to the house for the lights to impact the darkness. So, imagination? Yes. Terrifying? YES!!. Real?... Depends on how you define real I guess. It certainly gave me a greater appreciation of how the stories of wirry-cows, demons, goblins, malevolent aliens etc could came to be so prevalent in ancient and modern folklore.<br><br>Hi Cherokee<br><br>“Blending in and the appearance of poverty are excellent survival strategies indeed! Evolution tends to move us towards the average anyway. What do you think?”<br><br>My feeling is yes, although personally that doesnt work too well for me. Im just too big, ugly and loud to carry it off all that well. I have noticed that whenever anything resembling a “revolution” comes around I seem to be one of the first up against the proverbial “wall”. Therefore my own favourite strategies run more along the lines of “prepare an escape route” and “keep em guessing”.

<div class="avtb a_61c74c" id=c7449826703912584396></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/02333438671130100114 rel=nofollow>Bill Pulliam</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Gil -- several points. [I've deleted the parts that JMG addressed already while I was composing this]. First, you seem to think the "oil" issue is mostly about cars. That is an exceedingly tunnel-vision perspective. Petroleum fuels the global transportation network, without which Europe would soon starve to death. It also fuels the global agricultural industry, without which Europe would soon starve to death. If you think you are less subject to the shocks from petroleum shortages, think again. I agree, by the way, that topsoil depletion is also a major global problem -- the effects of which we are at present largely masking with petroleum-dependent fertilizers and industrial agriculture. <br><br>Second, sort out your medieval history 101, lecture number 2. The "Dark Ages" were the period following the collapse of the Roman Empire and before the rise of large powerful Feudal principalities. They are called that, I believe, because there is so little information recorded about them. The archeological evidence of the "Dark Ages" suggests they were a time of small-scale social organization and localized agriculture in the wake of the collapse of most long-distance trade. It is also in this time that the isolation between regions caused Latin to evolve and diversify into all its descendent tongues. The lives of the peasants in outlying areas (i.e. most of Europe) might not have been a whole lot better or worse than under Roman rule. Archaeologists have found that in fact quite a lot of cultural and technological development took place during this era; the term "Dark Ages" is now considered a biased and elitist term applied by those who considered Roman society to be the epitome of human achievement. It's an unpopular aspect of European history that the lives of the ordinary people seems to have mostly plodded along down pretty much the same lines, with occasional episodes of war and pillaging, right through all the major cultural transitions and power shifts that historians make their careers out of studying. The Basques raised sheep, the English raised barley, they built their houses and worked their farms in similar ways, century after century. <br><br>Overall you seem to be falling in to the common European trap of blaming it on America and believing that Europe is somehow not directly involved in the global petroleum economy and its corresponding military industrial complex. You may get to find out the truth about this in coming decades after we finish bankrupting ourselves and Europe has to get by on its own. European history suggests this will NOT be a time of peace or prosperity!<br><br>And finally, you seem to forget, as do most euro-Americans, that for the majority of present-day Americans, if you go back more than a few hundred years our history IS european history. There are more people of "celtic" (another term that archaeologists have abandoned) ancestry here than there are in the UK.<br><br><a href=after-money.html#c7449826703912584396 title="comment permalink">5/18/10, 7:54 AM</a><br><br>

I must say I see the cause and effect reversed: it's a stable environment that begets complexity, not the other way around. In other words, if the environment remains fixed eventually specialized creatures will evolve to fit all its niches; if the environment is in flux, many of these specialized creatures will go extinct and the generalists (cockroaches, rats, humans) will survive. However, your contrast to human institutions still stands: it's change that leads to human complexity, not stability. Perhaps this is why it's unstable, as the increased complexity is itself a change that leads to increased complexity!<br><br><a href=after-money.html#c4181605690609134903 title="comment permalink">5/18/10, 7:04 PM</a><br><br>
