Industrial civilization is a complicated thing, and its decline and fall bids fair to be more complicated still, but both rest on the refreshingly simple foundations of physical law. That’s crucial to keep in mind, because the raw emotional impact of the unwelcome future breathing down our necks just now can make it far too easy to retreat into one form or another of self-deception.<br><br>Plenty of the new energy technologies discussed so enthusiastically on the internet these days might as well be poster children for this effect. I think most people in the peak oil community are aware by now, for example, that the sweeping plans made for ethanol production from American corn as a solution to petroleum depletion neglected one minor but important detail: all things considered, growing corn and turning it into ethanol uses more energy than you get back from burning the ethanol. It’s not at all surprising that this was missed, for the same variety of bad logic underlies an astonishing amount of our collective conversation about energy these days.<br><br>The fundamental mistake that drove the ethanol boom and bust seems to be hardwired into our culture. Here’s an example. Most bright American ten-year-olds, about the time they learn about electric motors and generators, come up with the scheme of hooking up a motor and a generator to the same axle, running the electricity from the generator back to the motor, and using the result to power a vehicle. It seems perfectly logical; the motor drives the generator, the generator powers the motor, perpetual motion results, you hook it up to wheels or the like, and away you drive on free energy. Yes, I was one of those ten-year-olds, and somewhere around here I may still have one of the drawings I made of the car I planned to build when I turned sixteen, using that technology for the engine.<br><br>Of course it didn’t work. Not only couldn’t I get the device to power my bicycle – that was how I planned on testing the technology out – I couldn’t even make the thing run without a load connected to it at all. No matter how carefully I hooked up a toy motor to a generator salvaged from an old bicycle light, fitted a flywheel to one end of the shaft, and gave it a spin, the thing turned over a few times and then slowed to a halt. What interests me most about all this in retrospect, though, is that the adults with whom I discussed my project knew that it wouldn’t work, and told me so, but had the dickens of a time explaining why it didn’t work in terms that a bright ten-year-old could grasp.<br><br>This isn’t because the subject is overly complicated. The reason why perpetual motion won’t work is breathtakingly simple; the problem is that the way most people nowadays think about energy makes it almost impossible to grasp the logic involved. Most people nowadays think that since energy can be defined as the capacity to do work, if you have a certain amount of energy, you can do a certain amount of work with it. That seems very logical; the problem is that the real world doesn’t work that way.<br><br>In the real world, you have to take at least two other things into account. The first of them, of course, has seen a fair amount of discussion in peak oil circles: to figure out the effective energy yield of any energy source, you have to subtract the amount of energy needed to extract that energy source and put the energy in itto work. That’s the problem of net energy, and it’s the trap that’s clamped tightly onto the tender portions of the American ethanol industry; ethanol from corn only makes sense as an energy source if you ignore how much energy has to go into producing it.<br><br>The second issue, though, is the one I want to stress here. It’s seen a lot less discussion, but it’s even more important than the issue of net energy, and it unfolds from the most ironclad of all the laws of physics, the second law of thermodynamics. The point that needs to be understood is that how much energy you happen to have on hand, even after subtracting the energy cost, doesn’t actually matter a bit when it comes to doing work. The amount of work you get out of a given energy source depends, not on the amount of energy, but on the difference in energy concentration between the energy source and the environment.<br><br>Please read that again: <i>The amount of work you get out of a given energy source depends, not on the amount of energy it contains, but on the difference in energy concentration between the energy source and the environment.</i><br><br>Got that? Now let’s take a closer look at it.<br><br>Left to itself, energy always moves from more concentrated states to less concentrated states; this is why the coffee in your morning cuppa gets cold if you leave it on the table too long. The heat that was in the coffee still exists, because energy is neither created nor destroyed; it’s simply become useless to you, because most of it’s dispersed into the environment, raising the air temperature in your dining room by a fraction of a degree. There’s still heat in the coffee as well, since it stops losing heat when it reaches room temperature and doesn’t continue down to absolute zero, but room temperature coffee is not going to do the work of warming your insides on a cold winter morning.<br><br>In a very small way, as you sit there considering your cold coffee, you’re facing an energy crisis; the energy resources you have on hand (the remaining heat in the coffee) will not do the work you want them to do (warming your insides). Notice, though, that you’re not suffering from an energy shortage – there’s exactly the same amount of energy in the dining room as there was when the coffee was fresh from the coffeepot. No, what you have is a shortage of the difference between energy concentrations that will allow the energy to do useful work. (The technical term for this is <i>exergy</i>). How do you solve your energy crisis? One way or another, you have to increase the energy concentration in your energy source relative to the room temperature environment. You might do that by dumping your cold coffee down the drain and pouring yourself a fresh cup, say, or by putting your existing cup on a cup warmer. Either way, though, you have to get some energy to do the work, and that means letting it go from higher to lower concentrations.<br><br>Any time you make energy do anything, you have to let some of it follow its bliss, so to speak, and pass from a higher concentration to a lower one. The more work you want done, the more exergy you use up; you can do it by allowing a smaller amount of highly concentrated energy to disperse, or by allowing a much larger amount of modestly concentrated energy to do so, or anything in between. One way or another, though, the total difference in energy concentration between source and environment – the total exergy – decreases when work is done. Mind you, you can make energy do plenty of tricks if you’re willing to pay its price; you can change it from one form to another, and you can even concentrate one amount of energy by sacrificing a much larger amount to waste heat; but one way or another, the total exergy in the system goes down.<br><br>This is why my great discovery at age ten didn’t revolutionize the world and make me rich and famous, as I briefly hoped it would. Electric motors and generators are ways of turning energy from one form into another – from electricity into rotary motion, on the one hand, and from rotary motion into electricity on the other. Each of them necessarily disperses some energy, and thus loses some exergy, in the process. Thus the amount of electricity that you get out of the generator when the shaft is turning at any given speed will always be less than the amount of electricity the motor needs to get the shaft up to that speed.<br><br>This gets missed whenever people assume that the amount of energy, rather than its concentration, is the thing that matters. Post something on the internet about energy as a limiting factor for civilization, and dollars will get you doughnuts that somebody will respond by insisting that the amount of energy in the universe is infinite. Now of course Garrett Hardin was quite right to point out in <i>Filters Against Folly</i> that when somebody says “X is infinite,” what’s actually being said is “I refuse to think about X;” the word “infinite” functions as a thoughtstopper, a way to avoid paying attention to something that’s too uncomfortable to consider closely.<br><br>Still, there’s another dimension to the problem, and it follows from the points already raised here. Whether or not there’s an infinite amount of energy in the universe – and we simply don’t know one way or the other – we can be absolutely sure that the amount of highly concentrated energy in the small corner of the universe we can easily access is sharply and distressingly finite. Since energy always tries to follow its bliss, highly concentrated energy sources are very rare, and only occur when very particular conditions happen to be met.<br><br>In the part of the cosmos that affects us directly, one set of those conditions exist in the heart of the sun, where gravitational pressure squeezes hydrogen nuclei so hard that they fuse into helium. Another set exists here on the Earth’s surface, where plants concentrate energy in their tissues by tapping into the flow of energy dispersing from the sun, and other living things do the same thing by tapping into the energy supplies created by plants. Now and again in the history of life on Earth, a special set of conditions have allowed energy stockpiled by plants to be buried and concentrated further by slow geological processes, yielding the fossil fuels that we now burn so recklessly. There are a few other contexts in which energy can be had in concentrated forms – kinetic energy from water and wind, both of them ultimately driven by sunlight; heat from within the Earth, caught and harnessed as it slowly disperses toward space; a handful of scarce and unstable radioactive elements that can be coaxed into nuclear misbehavior under exacting conditions – but the vast majority of the energy we have on hand here on Earth comes directly or indirectly from the sun.<br><br>That in itself defines our problem neatly, because by the time it gets through 93 million miles of deep space, then filters its way down through the Earth’s relatively murky atmosphere, the energy in sunlight is pretty thoroughly dispersed. That’s why green plants stockpile only about 1% of the energy in the light striking their leaves; the rest either bounces off the leaves or gets dispersed into waste heat in the process of keeping the plant alive and enabling it to manufacture the sugars that store the 1%. Sunlight just isn’t that concentrated, and you have to disperse one heck of a lot of it to get a very modest amount of energy concentrated enough to do much of anything with it.<br><br>All this explains as well why the “zero point energy” people are basically smoking their shorts. The premise of zero point energy is that there’s a vast amount of energy woven into the fabric of spacetime; if we can tap into it, we solve all our energy problems and go zooming off to the stars. They do seem to be right that there’s a huge amount of energy in empty space, but once again, the amount of energy does not tell you how much work you can do with it, and zero point energy is by definition at the lowest possible level of concentration. By definition, therefore, it can’t be made to do anything at all, and any attempt to make use of it belongs right up there on the shelf with my motor-generator gimmick.<br><br>The same logic also explains why projects for coming up with a replacement for fossil fuels using sunlight, or any other readily available renewable energy source, are doomed to fail. What makes fossil fuels so valuable is the fact that the energy they contain was gathered over countless centuries and then concentrated by geological processes involving fantastic amounts of heat and pressure over millions of years. They define the far end of the curve of energy concentration, at least on this planet, which is why they are as scarce as they are, and why no other energy resource can compete with them – as long as they still exist, that is.<br><br>As concentrated fossil fuel supplies deplete, in turn, a civilization that depends on them for its survival will find itself in a very nasty bind. If ours is anything to go by, it will proceed to make that bind even worse by trying to make up the difference by manufacturing new energy sources at roughly the same level of concentration. That’s a losing bargain, because it maximizes the amount of exergy that gets lost: you have to disperse a lot of energy to make the concentrated energy source, remember, before you can get around to using the concentrated energy source to do anything useful. Thus trying to fill our gas tanks with some manufactured substitute for gasoline, say, drains our remaining supplies of concentrated energy at a much faster pace than the other option – that of doing as much as possible with relatively low concentrations of energy, and husbanding the highly concentrated energy sources for those necessary tasks that can’t be done without them.<br><br>This is where E.F. Schumacher’s concept of “intermediate technology,” which was discussed in last week’s post, can be fitted into its broader context. Schumacher’s idea was that state-of-the-art factories and an economy dependent on exports to the rest of the world are not actually that useful to a relatively poor nation trying to build an economy from the ground up. He was right, of course – those Third World nations that have prospered are precisely the ones that used trade barriers to shelter low-tech domestic industries, and entered the export market only after building a domestic industrial base one step at a time – but in a future in which all of us will be a good deal poorer than we are today, his insights have a wider value. A state-of-the-art factory, after all, is more expensive in terms much more concrete than paper money; it takes a great deal more exergy to build and maintain one than it does to build and maintain a workshop using hand tools and human muscles to produce the same goods.<br><br>My readers will doubtless be aware that such considerations have about as much chance of being taken seriously in the governing circles of American politics and business as a snowball has for a long and comfortable stay in Beelzebub’s back yard. Fortunately, the cooperation of the current American political and executive classes is entirely unnecessary. In the next few posts, we’ll discuss some of the ways that individuals, families, and local communities can make the switch from economic dependence on highly concentrated energy sources to reliance on much more modestly concentrated and more widely available options. The fact that most of the energy in our highly concentrated energy sources has already followed its bliss into entropic ecstasy puts hard limits on what can be achieved, but there’s still plenty of room to make a bad situation somewhat better.

There are so many different arms of the state required to maintain the fear of authority so that people will continue to act against their own interest; the secret police, gulags, propaganda, managing external threats both real and imagined, etc. <br><br>This can be maintained for a while, but eventually the combined passive resistance of many individuals against the state will help remove the walls that prevent entropy from its fulfillment of equilibrium. The people are like gravity, a relatively weak force in the mass of an individual, but powerful in the combined mass of many working in concert, or even unknown to each other. Perhaps this is a bit simplistic. <br><br>The United States differs from the despotic state in obvious ways, freedom of speech, assembly etc. but in politics and economics, people often pursue actions that ultimately work against their interests and maintain the concept of the state. This is the power of the American Dream. The State need spend vastly smaller amounts of energy to maintain its social hierarchy, because the amount of passive resistance is very small. People believe in the system that ultimately holds them down and thereby help the State maintain the anti-entropic social system where the few enjoy the surplusses created by the many. <br><br>I think this is what makes the situation facing the US the most perplexing, because the prospects of a change in thinking among the many who can turn the course of the country are caught up in the myth of progress. How do we get people to see that we need a social change more than a new miracle widget?<br><br><a href=#c3388726789150891697 title="comment permalink">2/24/10, 8:09 PM</a><br><br>

Still, in some ways despotism is much simpler than democracy; that's one of the reasons despotisms flourish in times of crisis. <br><br>Lamb, by all means have your friend take a look at the blog, but don't expect him to change his mind. Most people -- on all sides of any controversy, not just this one -- decide what they want to believe on the basis of emotion, and then look for evidence supporting that belief. That's one of the reasons that peak oil is such a challenge to communicate -- most people don't want to believe that it's possible, and given the future that peak oil is giving us, it's not hard to understand why. <br><br>Greatblue, the funny thing is that when you have huge amounts of cheap fossil fuels, it's actually easier and cheaper to disperse huge amounts of highly concentrated energy than to employ lower concentrations to do the same thing. Of course you're right in the long run -- since fossil fuels are available only in finite and rapidly depleting amounts, we should be using them only for those things where they're needed, and using solar energy to heat our household hot water, etc. Our descendants will think the way you do -- but then they'll never have the experience of living in a society where wasting energy is more economical than saving it!<br><br><a href=#c8863981180396960738 title="comment permalink">2/24/10, 10:06 PM</a><br><br>

Energy in vs. energy out is a pretty clear concept, and Science magazine did a nice job of presenting Hubbert's logic back then.<br><br>Of course a little self-interest creeps in, and even people who clearly know better, like Amory Lovins, publicly buy into nonsense like Bush's "hydrogen economy" because there was a lot to be gained by going along for the ride. I haven't heard much about hydrogen since the Bushies left office, though. <br><br>A book 25 years old, Daniel Goleman's "Vital Lies, Simple Truths" is still a classic description of our tendency to deceive ourselves. <br><br>Thanks for continuing to present important truths in very clear prose.<br><br><a href=#c932937071819528655 title="comment permalink">2/24/10, 10:13 PM</a><br><br>

I didn't really have the heart to tell him that it takes more energy to produce the hydrogen than is released by burning it. Exergy neatly sums up this predicament.<br><br>People don't really think much about energy at all. It's one of those things that is reasonably transparent to the end user.<br><br>If you look on the Internet you'll see that in Victoria, Australia in 2003 the average household consumed 17.5kWh/day most of which is generated by burning brown coal (pretty scary in itself and thankfully no longer exported to China). I'd be pretty certain that it's much higher now as the market here is being flooded with cheap air conditioners which chew up huge amounts of power. Most people however, pay their bills, switch on appliances and don't think much about it.<br><br>A few years ago as training for living in a house that is not connected to the power grid we cut our useage to 3kWh/day and maintained this (more or less).<br><br>It seems to me that we could do far better with energy conservation than burning ethanol in vehicles. In Australia, you can buy between 10% and 90% ethanol petrol which is predominantly made from plant wastes. The sad fact though is that it would be far better to put these plant wastes back into the soil to reduce useage of super phosphates, build soil carbon etc. Energy conservation, whilst mostly overlooked and being a dirty word, will delay and soften the inevitable shift to a low energy world.<br><br>I recommend all readers to have a good look at their electricity bills.

For instance, I recently came across a calculation that really astounded me. That is, the amount of energy being delivered into your car by the petrol bowser (assuming it pumps out at 1 L/s which is about the maximum rate they do) is equivalent to the full output of a 30MW power station - a reasonable sized hydro station. So to fill your car you're taking the full output of a small power station for about 1 minute.<br><br>That's the main reason that electric vehicles haven't taken off - there is nothing like the concentrated energy of liquid fuels. And because the full cost of these fuels - taking into account the time that they took to be produced, and the effects that their burning has on the future environment - is not being paid, we have been wasting them profligately<br><br><a href=#c1035867397482607900 title="comment permalink">2/25/10, 12:09 AM</a><br><br>

I wasn't trending toward this mode of thought, and had no predisposition to it: quite the reverse. I simply stumbled upon the blog and read. The cogency of the arguments employed here made the difference, and the reasonableness with which they tend to be put. <br><br>One canard I'd like to see you shoot down again is that promoted by the book "Alcohol Can Be a Gas," whose author argues with great enthusiasm that we can supply our cars and household energy needs by fermenting the leaves that fall from our neighborhood trees and the like: <br> <br>http://www.alcoholcanbeagas.com/<br><br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnJvX7meAcE<br><br>I mention this for the same reason as Lamb: a friend who doesn't want to hear the bad news. In particular it's necessary to address the tree leaves issue, as he's mentioned that more than once. As I recall lawn cuttings and other garden detritus have been mentioned as potential bonanza energy sources. I find it incredibly difficult to get people to listen to something they don't want to hear, especially when everyone else thinks that way too. <br><br>I receive a newsletter from a "bright green" group but pay only limited attention to what they have to say. They seem to suppose that all we need to do is make a few lifestyle changes and a newly adjusted green industrial high technological civilization can carry on indefinitely.

I have wondered for some time what is the highest level of technology that a de-industrialised, post Peak Oil world can sustain? Clearly the answer is dependent upon the energy gradient of available fuels.<br><br>My intuitive response is that at best you end up back in the steam age (if you have lots of something available to burn), or more likely for most of the world, something even more primitive (think whatever a blacksmith can make).<br><br>Where I live (NSW, Australia) we have vast coal reserves that we love digging up and burning to power aircon and ipods. I can see a time when the men with picks, go back into the mines here to dig out the coal by hand. <br><br>A couple of years ago I toured the ruins of what was once a massive shale-oil refinery in the mountains near here. The photos of the place when it was running were of an utterly apocalyptic moonscape.

But let's not let the idea of creating unihabitable wastelands get in the way of bad idea. You start explaining how the nuclear process actually requires extra ordinary amounts of fossils fuels to produce the raw material required to boil water with isotopes, and people are like "Wha??? It's a green alternative". <br>Maybe radioactive green. Maybe greenback green. Certainly it has nothing to do with the ecological sense of the word. Nuclear energy doesn't run vehicles, or lube them or make the paint or plastic insulation for the wiring or any of the other assorted necessities invovled in the process of extracting this "killer stone". It is a drain on resources, histroically, currently and most definitely in the future where our descendants have to expend valuable, precious whatever they have to deal with our the radioactive discharge. And I don't think they'll be shooting it at the sun in a rocket either.<br><br>Not to mention it is also a dwindling resource, somewhere on the downward slope of its own Hubbert's curve, which requires crushing or dissolving more and more ludicrous amounts of rock in order to extract smaller and smaller quantities of this "industrial Jesus", our saviour.<br><br>But the notion that physical labour, applied to tasks that provide the goods you and your communities require, is more energy efficient than building factories a couple of thousand miles away to ship your raw materials to just so you can ship it back again still seems lost on people. The current form of international trade relations and short sighted energy policies aimed soley at maintaining and even expanding our current disposable lifestyles will not see us through an energy crisis. They will spur it on and feed our delusions. <br>But learning how to straighten a buckled bicycle rim will help. Getting used to pushing a trolley full of goods across town will make sense later on. Creating or at least partaking in local networks of food supply; food that is suitable to your area in order to minimise the energy needed to grow it, will definitely help see you through. Getting used to seasonal fruit amd vegatables in other words. Like static nomads. Like farmers. You need to find a niche or two that you enjoy and that are of service. Even if your just looking after yourself and don't wan't to take part in any networks, communities or politics in fact especially if your going to take this path, you need some survival ability. Some subsistence mentality. And this is something you need to practise. Not just practice. You have to live it. <br><br>But if you are not going to hermitize, then you will find division of labour is essential, even if we at some stage revert to hunter gatherers. The willingness to foster your own talent and a healthy critical mind is the sharpest tool known to humanity. So nurture something you can be good enough at that others will want, be it skills or produce because we need Masters of trades for the future, not IT geniuses, and Masters need time and a community that is set up to support and profit from their existence in order become highly skilled.<br><br><a href=#c5090694041938258815 title="comment permalink">2/25/10, 3:36 AM</a><br><br>

I've read this blog for about a year now, plus The Long Descent, and I have to say that I'm truly grateful for these calm and thoughtful articles.<br><br>On topic: Understanding the implications of these thoughts and seeing a future (as far as that's possible) that is devoid of today's highly concentrated energy sources has -- over the course of the past months -- convinced me that there will be no high-tech future like now, "only more so", as you've put it several times. I haven't even lived half of my expected lifetime, and I'm sure that within 10 or 20 years (or much sooner, if all doesn't go well), I won't be earning my living by sitting in front of a computer in an air-conditioned building, or worse, traveling halfway around the world to sit in other companies' air-conditioned buildings.<br><br>I'm on the verge of quitting my quiet job that, all things considered, is part of extravagant energy usage. Developing electronic devices with microchips and other components containing rare and toxic materials takes high energy input and pollutes third world countries. This is definitely not going to go on for much longer, as one of your past posts pointed out.<br><br>I'm seriously considering going back to university, picking up silviculture and on the side learning some other useful skills that puts me back in touch with the first economy. I strongly believe that it's not too late to make such a change now, but it may get rough in the bumpy times ahead of us. I'm considering myself lucky to live in Germany that has very well-kept forests. But given that energy demands most certainly can't be met by oil and gas within a few years, there may be the need for keeping people from over-exploiting them in the transition from the oil/industrial age to whatever comes next.<br><br><a href=#c1428771052180261046 title="comment permalink">2/25/10, 4:52 AM</a><br><br>

It was one of the best explanations of the Second Law of Thermodynamics that I've seen. At least you have me convinced that the days of happy motoring are going the way of the Hummer- RIP (Recycle In Pieces). You may be right in that 'believers' make their decisions based on emotion, then cherry pick 'facts' that support their beliefs. To me, that sounds like a lack of critical thinking, which apparently is no longer taught in schools today.<br><br>I'm looking forward more on Schumacher and intermediate technology. I first discovered the concept in college, and made the naive mistake of bringing up the topic in the Industrial Technology department. I was wondering why it wasn't used more often in Appalachia and other parts of America that have been poverty stricken long before the latest financial kerfluffle. Of course, I was told that appropriate technology wasn't 'appropriate' for the Western world, but rather only for use in Third World 'pits of despair'. Apparently, in the developed world, we are supposed to solve all of our problems by taking out loans and throwing massive amounts of capital at them. Rather than a spring-pole-lathe (which any hillbilly with an axe and a pen-knife could make in less than a day), I was told that an 'appropriate' solution would be a quarter-million-dollar CNC lathe, and a battalion of engineers to operate and maintain it. Apparently, the more expensive, hi-tech solution would result in more higher paying jobs, than a bunch of rednecks with home-brewed lathes in their backyards. Then again, these same people were teaching just-in-time inventorying and worshiping the almighty Toyota management system. We've seen where those two schools of thought have gone recently...<br><br>Greatblue- I remember seeing a turn-of-the-(19th)century illustration from a world's fair which featured a solar powered steam engine with parabolic mirrors. Steam power was another topic that interested me in college, but I was told that it was 'hopelessly outdated' and would never again see the light of day.<br><br><a href=#c5958948114083230143 title="comment permalink">2/25/10, 6:41 AM</a><br><br>

We're all made of "stuff" and all "stuff" requires energy to get anything done. We've only recently come to see entropy at work in shaping living systems. <br><br>This is still a monumental blind spot, however, even among people who get Peak Oil, Energy Return on Energy Invested, Greens, etc. Many bright people fail to see entropy at work in their own bodies and in our social systems even after they have become aware of its effect on ecosystems.<br><br>In 1989, the leaders of the old USSR finally figured out how to modernize their system of social control. Turning everyone into a spy and an informant, running a secret police and staffing gulags requires much more energy than the way we do it in the US. You don't need an old-fashioned police state when everyone is self-policing. <br><br>But even our system of self-policing has its entropic limits. It can only be maintained as long as there is a mass media and mass education to spread and install the necessary memes in the general population that are required for it to work. These institutions, however, are also just as dependent of concentrated energy to continue to function effectively. They will eventually succumb to the Second Law as well.<br><br><a href=#c6611258172794662139 title="comment permalink">2/25/10, 6:52 AM</a><br><br>

Also, look into the net energy involved. <br><br>Tgmac, that's certainly viable. Another option is coppicing, which produces firewood on a very quickly renewable basis. Do you return your ashes to the soil? <br><br>James, it sounds really good until you do the math and discover that if we planted every single acre of arable land in the US in hemp, leaving not one square inch to grow food, and turned it all into biodiesel, we still wouldn't get more than a relatively modest fraction of the energy we currently get from fossil fuels. <br><br>Of course there's a second issue as well. Most people who suggest projects like this aren't actually doing anything to make them happen; it's as though bringing up an imaginary solution makes it easier not to worry about the really very challenging mess we're in. That's not going to help anybody, other than as a tranquilizer. <br><br>LS, my guess is you end up with something close to 18th century technology where society is stable enough to maintain it, and something closer to Dark Age levels where it isn't. But we'll see.<br><br>Xhmko, you won't find me climbing onto the nuclear bandwagon! No nation has been able to run a nuclear power industry without huge government subsidies, and that suggests to me that the net energy from nuclear power is very low, quite possibly negative. <br><br>Conchshooter, by all means plan on surviving. <br><br>Viking, that sounds like a good plan. Those who can produce goods and services without the benefit of a fully functioning industrial economy will likely do well in the years ahead. <br><br>Antony, if intermediate tech took off in the US, there would be much less need for Industrial Tech graduates. As the US becomes a Third World country, people who know how to build spring-pole lathes -- yes, and solar steam engines (that's a technology I would love to see back in use!) -- are going to be much more valuable, but they're likely going to have to train themselves.<br><br>Bruce, good.

While we currently do not have a replacement for fossil fuels (and are unlikely to find one) I'd like to know if you agree or disagree that the <b> possibility</b>of coming up with a way/technology that accomplishes that still exists.<br><br>While oil is the energy source of highest-density known to man because it is energy that was collected over millions of years under conditions we cannot emulate in the lab... you fail to address the <b> efficiency</b> (for lack of a better word) that nature used to accumulate such energy and concentrate it in the form of oil. Look at it this way: coal is a also fossil fuel. But coal's energy density is not as high as that of oil. So nature failed to be "as efficient" in the case of coal as it was in producing oil.<br><br>Now, in the form of a metaphor (please, indulge me) let's say that the process through which nature generated oil was this: suppose an oil field could be seen as a mountain of sand. And every 1,000 years a bird flies to a particular spot with a grain of "sand energy" on its beak, and then drops it. Every 1,000 years another bird does the same flight, and drops that grain of sand in the same spot. How long will it take for a mountain of sand to be formed in that spot? Well, million of years for sure. <br><br>Then one day, millions or billions of years later, a new species comes a long with the ability to walk, and discovers that mountain of energy. Now, it took millions of years for that mountain to be formed - would it be wise to use up that mountain of energy in just a few decades or few hundred years? Of course not. <br><br>However, here is the point that you fail to address: what if we learned a process through which we could build such mountains? What if in our process, instead of moving a grain of "energy sand" every 1,000 years, what if we moved it everyday instead? Such process would be more "efficient" than nature's formula for producing oil, wouldn't you say? (and the word production is being used in its true meaning here).<br><br>I end my analogy here. What I am trying to say is this: the sun radiates more energy on the planet in one year than we have in "known reserves of fossil fuels". But the problem is we don't know how to harness that energy yet. However, the possibility does exist that we <b>could</b>. Are we likely to discover a way?<br><br>Probably not. The reason is that we are a lazy species. Fossil fuels, rather than helping us evolve made us devolve, I would argue. Thus we are unlikely to have the ingenuity necessary to come up with such a process/technology - because the "energy" necessary isn't going to come from a species that has trained itself in being lazy by using the free energy of fossil fuels to build and run their societies.<br><br>It is indeed a paradox. If God is omnipotent, can God create a rock that is so heavy that He/She cannot lift it? That metaphor is the same as what we are discussing here. We are unlikely to be able to accomplish such thing, however, the possibility still exists (in a parallel universe it may be happening).<br><br>For the record, I'm not advocating that we pursue a new source of energy in order to do business as usual. I'm actually against nuclear and coal liquefaction. The challenge appears to be that not only would we have to find another energy source that can keep business as usual, but also reduce our carbon emissions at the same time.<br><br>This makes life very interesting right now.<br><br>And I just hope that you don't close your mind to that possibility.

There are a number of widely discussed approaches to concentrating energy from earth, sea and sky that have a higher chance of succeeding than the ridiculous corn ethanol. There are many ways to support a technically advanced civilization on a much tighter energy budget than we have today. These approaches fail to get traction not because of technical limitations but because they require life changes that people currently resist, and that consequently their politicians don't support. But societies and attitudes and life expectations can change -- sometimes quite wrenchingly -- without actually collapsing. If a time traveler could vault from Europe 1910 to Europe 2010, he might be forgiven for concluding that overall conditions had been on a steady upward climb throughout those years.

It will get plenty of exercise. <br><br>Evan, you've just defined the most efficient way to use modest differentials in energy concentration -- slow things down, so the energy flow has time to do a lot of little jobs on the way to waste heat. That's what insulation does, for example -- and yes, it's also what an ecosystem (natural or human-designed) does when it works well. <br><br>John, of course that was a major driving factor. What I was addressing, though, was the extent to which a lot of intelligent people, many of whom haven't made a cent off the ethanol industry, jumped on that bandwagon (and are jumping on others of the same kind right now). In their case, a failure to grasp the laws of thermodynamics and the realities of net energy has a lot to do with the mistake. <br><br>RPtizzle, er, I think you've missed one of the central points of the post. When you say "the sun radiates more energy on the planet in one year than we have in 'known reserves of fossil fuels'" you're making exactly the mistake I was trying to critique -- confusing the amount of energy with its capacity to do work. Sunlight is a diffuse energy source by the time it reaches us, and the exergy it has available is simply not that great. <br><br>Green plants have been perfecting photosynthesis for something like two billion years, under evolutionary pressures that would make any possible increase in efficiency of energy storage a huge selective advantage. It's thus safe to assume that we're not likely to manage dramatic gains in efficiency over what nature's managed, unless we're either importing exergy from elsewhere (for example, using high-exergy fossil fuels to build solar panels) or ignoring some of the energy costs (for example, not including the fossil fuel used to provide the infrastructure for making solar panels in their net energy calculations). Now of course in actual practice we're doing both!<br><br>Ultimately, though, your metaphor of the heap of sand misses the central point at issue, which is that the energy expended by the bird bringing that sand has to be factored into the equation. Sure, we can make high-exergy fuels -- but we have to use very large amounts of concentrated energy to do so, and it's precisely our ability to get large amounts of concentrated energy that is fading out. Thus the repeated efforts to find some high-exergy fuel to replace fossil fuels, I argue, is a fool's errand -- and we need to accept that and put our efforts into something that can possibly do some good. <br><br>Mark, thanks for the links! I'd heard a little about rocket stoves, but it's good to see that a very simple and efficient technology of this kind is getting some attention. <br><br>Shark, no, I've already discussed the social feasibility issue in other posts. Here I'm pointing out that most of the supposed replacements for fossil fuels <i>also</i> fail the test of technical feasibility. Of course they're two different issues, but I do believe I've addressed them as such. As for your example from European history, er, do you think things would have gone the same way if (a) the Marshall Plan hadn't poured billions of dollars into rebuilding shattered European nations after 1945, and (b) energy use per capita hadn't skyrocketed in Europe over the course of the 20th century? It seems to me that you're confusing one example under extremely favorable terms with a law of history.<br><br><a href=#c4391572730269399401 title="comment permalink">2/25/10, 10:44 AM</a><br><br>

I think I understand where you are coming from, i.e. slow collapse even if it comes in steep ’L’ steps. I am PO aware and ELM makes sense and I have good knowledge of solar and other technologies. We have a solar powered golf cart which will operate our well and a few other things for quite a while. We grow most of our vegetables and can or solar dry them. I believe the solar cooker can do canning though I haven’t tried it yet. We have lots of stored food to get us well into the time of chaos which I believe will happen. Think Watts on steroids in every major city. <br><br>My concern is: In two or three hundred years humans will be into a very different energy circumstance. What real difference does it make what we say or do now? The inertia of the world of humans is such that it will do what it wants to do, which IMHO is crash and burn. This is not a lazy excuse for non action but a result of attending various “sustainable” meetings. When the first white explorer arrived in this area there were about 3000 Indians in a thousand square mile area from Lake Tahoe to the Pine Nut Mountains east of Winnemucca. There are more than a half million people in this area now. In three hundred years with all our knowledge for that time, this place may sustain 6000 to 10000 or even 20000 Indians. The high desert is not a very good place for sustainability. 20,000 people 300 years out is not a big deal to get one’s shorts in a knot. I think I will just keep preparing for my extended family and bad times for a few years, like, just drop out and just forgetaboutit.

It feels like some pieces are missing. Human or livestock muscle power is being offered as a solution on the basis that the Second Law of Thermodynamics applies to all modern energy sources. But it applies just as much to muscle power. We have to eat, regardless, but we have to eat <i>more</i> when we do hard physical labor like working a garden by hand. We talk about the amount of energy needed to extract and refine fossil fuels or fissionable materials, but how much more garden must be grown simply to fuel the gardener?<br><br>An important consideration here is the fact that muscle power isn't the only thing making the garden yield energy. It's just the means of extraction, whereas the sun is the real energy source in food. The sun shines on the garden even when we sit idle.<br><br>I think this principle--that the sun shines on our planet even when nobody's bothering to use that energy--is something to key in on. I'm not suggesting that one year of sunshine is going to replace one year's worth of our present level of energy usage, but I think the amount of energy available in one year's worth of sunshine is grossly underestimated. It's just a matter of getting more efficient in collecting it and turning it into work.<br><br>This is where I question Kevin's scepticism about using leaves and grass as fuel. No doubt, one city's annual vegetation isn't going to replace one city's fossil fuel consumption. I think, though, that it could go quite a long way in providing energy for prioritized projects. And if we're using muscle power to harvest and process it, how is that any less efficient than using muscle power to harvest food?<br><br>A worm farmer in my neighborhood (she sells both worms and their castings) was telling me she was planning to get food wastes from local restaurants to feed to her worms. I suggested instead that she give me those wastes to feed to my chickens, and I'd give her chicken manure to feed to her worms. In each case, it looks like we're getting something from nothing, but of course, that is not possible. We're getting something from <i>waste</i>, and wringing out as much use as we can from it before letting it go. <br><br>Think of how much sunlight is wasted! How much is bounced back into space without doing any work? By wringing every bit of work out of those light waves that we can before letting them follow their bliss, I think we can concentrate a lot more energy than previous civilizations have. <br><br>It's not a simple matter of "either" massive fossil fuel consumption "or" resigning ourselves to living in the Bronze Age. There's a considerable margin there that's being overlooked, perhaps being too quickly dismissed as a perpetual motion machine because it commits the sin of giving people hope of something more sophisticated than a medieval existence. If the Myth of Progress is the religion of the mainstream, it appears that the Myth of Apocalypse is the religion of those who oppose it. I'd suggest there's at least a third option we should embrace: the Paradigm of Stinginess. :)<br><br><a href=#c3410544730882651658 title="comment permalink">2/25/10, 9:35 PM</a><br><br>

If the fall of empires is the work of a single process, you identify the major factors in that process by figuring out which factors are present in every case. If the fall of empires is the result of more than one process, you identify examples of imperial decline that have as much as possible in common, and work from there. In either case, you discard the statistical noise and focus on the common factors. <br><br>Lynford, you're quite right that people talk too much and do too little, and most of what they do isn't going to mean much in a few centuries. This is one of the reasons why I've been concentrating on two main themes here: first, the steps that can get as much of value as possible through the immediate round of crises, and second, the steps that can preserve worthwhile knowledge for the long term. That's something that can have a huge benefit centuries or millennia down the road. <br><br>Ian, good. I do exactly the same thing; my hand tools get used twenty times for every time I break out something that plugs in. <br><br>Yerocus, a very good point. Low grade heat gets neglected because what it can do isn't exciting, but space heating and domestic hot water (two good uses for low grade heat) are very, very good to have around! Myself, I'm much more interested in having a warm house in winter and hot baths than in keeping jetliners in the air -- but that's just me. <br><br>Bryant, thanks for the link. <br><br>Chris, excellent! You're quite right, of course -- and this is why there's been a steady trickle of big name figures from the green movement going over to the pro-nuclear camp. Mind you, that won't work either, but it's an easy mistake to make if you're committed to business as usual but you figure out that renewables just aren't going to do the trick. <br><br>DIYer, exactly. There's a huge amount that can be done with renewable energy; it's just not sufficient to enable us to live the profligate lifestyles we've gotten used to living. <br><br>Farmer, you're trying to score points again instead of responding to what I actually wrote, and that's not a useful habit. You know perfectly well that I'm not suggesting or predicting a return to the Bronze Age. Of course there are options that don't amount to the total abandonment of any technology more complex than a digging stick; I've discussed that point in detail in <a href=http://www.newsociety.com/bookid/4051 rel=nofollow>The Ecotechnic Future</a>, and also in dozens of posts here. <br><br>Xhmko, I haven't read anything like as much Holmgren as I probably should. Thanks for the reminder.<br><br>Coy, now there's a blast from the past. Yes, a lot of the 20th century Atlantis mythology talked about solar energy in those terms. I have no idea if prisms would work any better than those complicated mirror arrangements they're testing these days in the southwestern deserts; my guess, though, is that simpler technologies -- solar steam engines using simple parabolic dishes to focus sun on a boiler and turn a modestly sized engine, of the sort that were successfully used in the 1880s -- would be a better way to go about it. More on this in a forthcoming post.<br><br><a href=#c6428718335253801459 title="comment permalink">2/26/10, 12:05 PM</a><br><br>

And I have just read further material relevant to the question. As others have pointed out, you are one of the most level-headed peak oil commentators out there, so I'm hopeful I'll get an insightful response from you.<br><br>You are not alone in asserting that oil contained more energy in higher concentrations than any replacement we have found or will ever find, nuclear included. I have always wondered about the last point, but since world leaders, no doubt aware of our energy crisis, do not seem to be in a hurry to build nuclear reactors all over the place and the economy of the last few years have roughly followed the path leading to collapse predicted by the Peak Oilers, I assumed that their assessment of the situation should be roughly correct.<br><br>However, tonight I dug a little into the topic on the net, and this somehow led me to read M. King Hubbert's original 1956 essay on Peak Oil. Curious as to what this essay had to do with nuclear energy, I searched for 'nuclear' and this led me to the last section of the essay. What I found was astonishing, mostly by virtue of the fact that I have never seen it before, despite having been to dozens of sites dedicated to the Peak Oil theory originating from this essay.<br><br>To cut to the chase, here's the conclusion of the essay regarding nuclear power:<br><br>"it appears that there exist within minable depths in the United States rocks with uranium contents equivalent to 1000 barrels or more of oil per metric ton, whose total energy content is probably several hundred times that of all the fossil fuels combined. The same appears to be true of many other parts of the world. Consequently, the world appears to be on the threshold of an era which in terms of energy consumption will be at least an order of magnitude greater than that made possible by the fossil fuels."<br><br>This is in stark contrast to the conclusion of energy doom that Peak Oilers attributed to his essay.<br><br>There are caveats, to be sure. The energy figures assumes the use of breeder reactors to consume non-radioactive U-238 and Thorium as well as actual fissionable isotopes, and includes uranium derived from low grade sources where there only exist a hundred or so grams of uranium in a cubic meter of rock. However, breeder reactors have already become proven technology (they just aren't economically superior over non-breeding reactors because nuclear fuel availability hasn't yet become enough of a concern), and using the numbers provided in the essay, even digging up 1 ton of this low-grade ore (assuming a conservative 3 tonnes / m^3 of shale) would be the energy equivalent of the improbable feat of digging up 175 tons of pure coal or 758 barrels of oil from 1 ton of ore.<br><br>I fail to see how this puts nuclear fuel in the position of 'less energy in lower concentration' than oil.<br><br><a href=#c6958947974896330826 title="comment permalink">2/28/10, 7:45 AM</a><br><br>

But I have not found a detailed analysis of these factors that starts with the massive uranium quantities and energy concentrations shown above, deducts the energies required as listed above, and concludes that uranium has a lower EROEI than oil or coal.<br><br>------<br><br>It would seem to me that perhaps no such analysis has been made by any Peak Oiler, or they have only been made without taking breeding into account, assuming that it can't be practical, if thought is given to it at all.<br><br>Perhaps they are in denial because the prospect of a nuclear-fueled future with nuclear reactors and reprocessing plants in every town, trucks hauling tons of purified plutonium from reprocessing plants through city streets to god-knows where, and a population further doubling and redoubling in nuclear-fueled largesse until some other 'limit to growth' has been exceeded, international tensions flare, and nukes made from those wayward plutonium trucks fly in all directions in that War to Finally Really End All Wars is a prospect too awful to contemplate, even worse for them than the mere prospect of major dieoff and return to Stone Age that they are trying to come to grips with.<br><br>True, that future may be too terrible even for the world leaders to contemplate, which may be why few reactors are being built, fewer of them being breeders, but from what I've seen so far, it is a future we are energetically capable of carrying out, and indeed will probably carry out when push comes to shove and energy shortages from the current fossil fuels and the useless renewables really begin in earnest.<br><br>----<br><br>I don't know what response to expect from you, but at least I'm confident you won't give me the same kind of response that radio talk show host gave you when you presented your theory on the non-extraterrestrial origin of UFOs :)<br><br><a href=#c7454473396875370315 title="comment permalink">2/28/10, 7:51 AM</a><br><br>

No matter how much electricity costs, nuclear power still fails to break even.

The signal wattages are measured in milliwatts, and the long haul fibre used to connect cell sites is also very low-power. A cell tower can provide phone coverage over a 4-5 square mile area for a kilowatt or so per hour, although it is a lot more if it is linked into the network via microwaves. In remote areas of Indonesia and China they are already run entirely with photovoltaic systems, covering just the roof of the equipment shed.<br><br>The problem is the enormous cost of building and maintaining the network. Around the US, the cost of network maintenance runs into the tens of billions each year. The data warehouses and billing systems that make providing cell phone service profitable consume VAST quantities of power, in the gigawatt range.<br><br>Another problem is with the enormous investment of energy represented by those cheap little handsets. Handsets wear out fairly rapidly and have to be replaced every two or three years. Granted , some of that is planned obsolescence, the military uses cell phones with a 5 year rated life. Most of it though is the confluence of miniaturization and hard use. Hard to get past that without an entirely different way of thinking about portable communications.<br><br>The typical plain-vanilla cell uses about a barrel of oil to manufacture. between the glass, plastics, silicon foundries, etc. Smart phones, like the iPhone use much more.

Yeah a real life one. Talk about a practical skill... <br><br>Third, I am writing this in the train, so please don't feel offended if I just share a piece of information with you without joining to the discussion that probably has been taking place since last wednesday.<br><br>The fact that I wanted to share with you has to do with when His Archdruidry (sorry for that. Please read it as it was written, with all my affection, as I really like how you think and write.):<br><br>"They define the far end of the curve of energy concentration, at least on this planet,[...]".<br><br>There actually is one source of energy on Earth that is far far higher on the curve of "energy concentration". It is hydrogen, as in "let's transform hydrogen in helium as it happens at the center of the Sun". <br>Thus, there is on Earth a source of energy that pales every other one, and in very very large supply. Problem solved, see, you peak oilist, we always told you there was a solution...<br><br>Not so fast.<br><br>Let me add three concomitant pieces of information.<br><br>The first one is that transforming hydrogen in helium in a controlled way is a tremendous technical challenge. Tapping this energy is even harder. We know how to do it. Ask me. The answer will begin by "In theory...". The difference between science (understanding stuff), and technology (the art of making stuff)....<br>The most recent project trying to make such a power plant is called ITER(http://www.iter.org/). So far they are just at the level of achieving a way to hold the hydrogen while it fusions. Yes, it might sound silly but once you light up a little sun (which is in itself a challenge), how do you hold it ? Therefore we have a vision of a solution to the problem of getting lots and lots of energy, but we are far from being there yet.<br><br>The second piece of information is that to achieve such a technical feat is very very costly. I completely concur with Mr Greer that the level of technology we reached is due to the incredible amount of energy we used in the last three centuries, and not the other way around. This raises the question of wether or not we will be able to develop the technology needed to get fusion. <br><br>The third piece of information is more of an opinion than a fact... It has to do with the question of "we could do it, but should we ?". I have mixed feelings about this one. To me, modern civilisation is a metaphoric 3 years old playing with a loaded gun. Hhaving more free energy to support us in our current permanent-increase way will end up with us blowing ourselves up. And that well before we consume a centimeter of ocean water and start speaking like Donald Duck because of the helium rejected in the atmosphere. <br>Getting a very large source of energy might well not save us at all. <br><br>Maybe lots more of energy will help us grow up. Or maybe the peak oil decline will help us change. Or maybe not. That's where my cynicism and my optimism (This used to make me schizophrenic, but we have been much better lately, thanks) give me contradictory answers.<br><br>As a conclusion I would just say that if we really want to continue with infinite development, there is one land accessible from Earth, that is not bound to the laws of thermodynamics (or maybe it is and it is just infinite). It is the land of the mind. There is plenty of room for development there. That would be a solution.

A few years ago, a professor told our class how he'd traveled to Africa, to a village where people used to put bottles of water on their roofs to let the heat kill off most of the bacteria. The visitors introduced a new way: They painted a kettle all black and built a parabolic mirror from some available materials, bringing water in the kettle to a boil in a rather short time. The villagers were so impressed that they immediately wanted their other kettles painted black as well. Purifying water this quickly is great when it comes to cleaning wounds, etc.<br><br>But that's not the point. What I want to say is that this is probably the most direct use of sunlight you can find, heating water without first transforming the sunlight's energy to electricity (I believe solar ovens may use a similar principle?

"<br><br>There's a great interest on the part of some Brazilian businesses to export ethanol to the Americans for transportation. The ethanol produced in Brazil does have a positive energy return. Of course, it comes at the cost of deforestation and human exploitation. I know this from first-hand experience. But the interest does exist. If Americans can be oblivious to large number of killings (how many Iraqi lives have been lost since the Iraq war started), then the mere exploitation of other foreigners can be even more easily ignored by the American public and even labeled as "providing them with jobs".<br><br>Keep in mind that cars in the US run on gasoline, not ethanol. The government does already add up to 20% of ethanol to our gasoline, but beyond that you start having car problems. For ethanol to be truly viable in the US as a replacement to gasoline, you'd have to replace the US auto fleet. There are very few vehicles that run on flexfuel in the US (whereas in Brazil flexfuel vehicles are much more common).<br><br>The US gov was interested in importing ethanol from Brazil only until Brazil recently discovered large reserves of pre-salt oil.

But I believe that the debate about the nuclear power issue is a bit over-focused on the economics of it all, and not on the practicalities of trying to revamp our energy economy in our present economic and political climate. The interests of Big Oil and Big Coal are powerful in the US, and the fact of the matter is that we <br>have enough coal here to generate power for a long time to come, as long as we don't mind destroying our environment to do so. Granted, as oil gets increasingly scarce, it will drive up the costs of mining and transporting coal, as well as building more coal-burning stations (and the coal industry does not mention that fact, of course). But the same will also be true for the <br>nuclear industry as well, with added costs for disposal of waste for the next few thousand years. <br>Without oil, the expense of mining, transporting and building more power plants of any kind will <br>begin to rise beyond what any company can afford without huge government subsidies. And does <br>anyone seriously think we are living in a political climate -- for the foreseeable future -- in <br>which people will support tens of billions more in government handouts of any kind? <br> The first link and quote is from a pro-nuclear interest group's website:<br><br>http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf02.html<br><br>"Nuclear power is cost competitive with other forms of electricity generation, except where there <br>is direct access to low-cost fossil fuels." <br><br>The last half of the sentence surely leaves the US out of that argument, with our vast reserves of <br>coal and natural gas.

The model focuses on economic cost, not regulated or <br>subsidized cost. According to our study, the baseline cost of new nuclear power is 6.7 cents per <br>kilowatt-hour, compared to 4.2 cents for coal and natural gas (when the price of gas is $4.50 per <br>thousand cubic feet). Plausible, but unproved, technology could reduce nuclear costs to those of <br>coal and gas. However, if a cost is assigned to carbon emissions — either through a tax or some other way, as in a current Congressional proposal that would limit emissions but allow companies to buy and sell the right to discharge more pollutants — nuclear power could become an attractive economic option.

Add to that fact the waste disposal factor ("not in my back yard") and the fact that we <br>would see ever-increasing fuel costs before we got enough nuke plants started and actually <br>operating, and the subsidies already given to coal and gas -- I'm quite pessimistic about being <br>saved by nuclear power.<br><br><a href=#c8699026703696381112 title="comment permalink">3/1/10, 11:06 PM</a><br><br>

We can scale the cost of building a nuclear plant based on muscle power by comparing it to cathedrals. It is of the order of a half a century for hundreds of people. And cathedral are far less complex buildings than nuclear plants. Add to that the energy cost of the blueprints. They need computers, which are very costly in energy to build because you need very complex production plants.<br>Loads of the incredible amount of energy you'll produce with the nuclear plant is thus eaten up by building the plant. Of course, if you have enough energy produced, you get over the building cost, and open a new era of "free" energy.<br>Oil just is so versatile and easy to use that it didn't take lots of effort to get there.<br><br>My conclusion to all this is that even if we have within our reach an "infinite" amount of energy, we need to rely heavily on oil to get to it and maintain it.<br> <br>This last point leads to the second thought I was lead to following the reflexion sparkled by Mr Green post: <br>We rely on oil for everything. And therefore, the existence proof of alternate energy sources is only marginally relevant to the real problem.<br><br>We depend on oil so much that the mere logistics of changing to other sources of energy is tremendous. Think how many cars, machines, planes, plants would have to be rebuilt. At this point alternatives to oil are as good as if they didn't exist. Switching to them would require a society able to produce much more energy than its running cost. And unless I am completely mistaken, our can't.<br><br>The crude fact is that our society consumes way too much power for its running cost. Because it's running relies so heavily on consuming. It is a *feature* of our society: use as much and as fast as possible. With a feed back loop: when you get more efficient at consuming you can consume even more even faster. As much as I love computers, they are a very good example. A I-Phone is a very efficient way of having one person consume an amount of energy that would probably run a steam-age village for decades. And the really sad part that it is made it so that it won't last more than 3 years.<br><br><a href=#c7682059614137554234 title="comment permalink">3/1/10, 11:54 PM</a><br><br>

Not that I doubt him (more than anyone else I mean) but making good accurate balances is hard enough when the topic is not as emotional as nuclear power.<br><br>I haven't looked up the numbers and I am not a peak oil expert. Nevertheless, I think that one piece of the answer lies in the difference between how energy efficient is a nuclear plant and how much it costs (in money) to produce electricity with it.<br><br>To calculate the plant energy efficiency, you need to count all the oil you need to run it, maintain it, etc. This is completely hidden, and can amount to a lot. And since oil is free energy, it costs next to nothing (relatively speaking).<br><br>Therefore you could hide lots of energy inefficiency and still have low cost electricity.<br><br>Now, before anyone blows up...<br><br>Let me tell you about some hard fact to backs up my assertion. <br>It is a story about onions. <br><br>Last time I bought onions I was presented to 2 different packs. One from France and one from New Zealand. Same onions really.<br>On second thoughts, as I saw that someone from New Zealand follows this thread, lets say that their onions are better. Slightly better. <br><br>Still, these onions come from roughly 20 000 km away (in miles that's a "heck of a lot" ). And fast, because I am not speaking about rotten or grown up onions. Genuine nice cute onions.<br><br>This proves without a doubt that oil is virtually free energy nowadays. I am speaking about 1 kg of onion that travelled through *half of the World*. This is an incredibly inefficient way of using energy. <br><br>And still both onion packs were the same price.<br><br>Now, make the intellectual leap of transforming the onions in energy producing plants. Coal plant would be the home made onions and nuclear plant would be the other-side-of-the-world onions, and you get my point. <br><br>I am not saying that's the full story, but it is part of it.<br><br>Thermodynamics gives you insightful vision into the world because of its laws, but also because it teaches you about calculating a balance.

You seem to fall on one of the traps that you talk about: being emotionally committed to something seems to create an environment where you reject the other side's arguments. This is quite normal: just because one detects problematic mental patterns, doesn't make person immune to such patterns. The real mistake is in believing that one is impermeable to classical human limitations just because they were detected and noted.<br><br>2. The argument of "just go and google for it" is particularly problematic: in fact, in this topic there is lots of credible information pointing in the opposite direction: That Uranium (235 _OR_ 238) and Thorium might be fairly abundant. Even the best post about this issue on TOD has been under fire and somewhat discredited. Suffice to say that planet nuclear reserves are far from being a settled issue.<br><br>3. Saying "one of these days I will have to do a post on that" is a nice rhetorical artefact, but doesn't really settle the question.<br><br>4. While it is comprehensible that you want to maintain your great essays clean from data points (as they are clearly good pieces as they are), it somewhat weakens your argument that you don't provide even minor references and citations to the more contentious parts of your essays. At least in the comment boxes.<br><br>5. Regarding subsidies, my country is highly subsidizing wind power (we are currently on the Top 5 per capita). For instance, this year the public is seeing a 3.5% increase of energy prices in a deflationary environment (with salaries flat and most other prices also flat). Feed-in tariffs and such. Subsidies are a necessary part of a transition, if such transition is to go smoothly.<br><br>PS - I abhor nuclear, but the point here is not about nuclear, but about having sound arguments grounded on a realistic view of the world.<br>PS 2 - I would imagine that you are that kind of people that appreciates constructive criticism above all (especially above unsubstantiated praise)<br><br><a href=#c4653925415956192943 title="comment permalink">3/2/10, 3:35 AM</a><br><br>

Even you acknowledge that nuclear power technology has potential. Like I said before, I admire your great writing ability, and also your brilliant mind. My goal with my posts has been to "keep you in check" (with all due respect) in my efforts to remove bias from your materials. <br><br>The point I originally made is that the mere <b>possibility </b> that we can find a replacement for the high-energy density of oil and other fossil fuels does exist. Should we invest our efforts towards finding it or developing technologies that may allow us to find a replacement for oil so we can continue to do business as usual? I'm of the <b>opinion </b> that we benefit more from not going in the direction of doing BAU.<br><br>You have a lot of credibility in the PO community, and you will enhance your credibility by admitting that other possibility (not the probability) to discover another energy source that will save us from going back to the stone/bronze age exists.

I'm sure you know that the future is pure possibility.

There, as here, nuclear power is receiving an energy subsidy from fossil fuels, as well as a financial subsidy from governments. I've discussed this at length already. As for your inability to find the figures, that's not exactly my problem, you know; other people don't seem to have that difficulty (see Ruben's post below, for example). <br><br>Viking, excellent! You get today's gold star, for understanding the difference between energy quantity and energy concentration -- a simple concept, but one that seems to evade almost everybody in this debate. <br><br>RPtizzle, attempting to anticipate the future is central to this blog's project. If you find that unwelcome, you're not likely to enjoy reading this blog. <br><br>Danby, good. My guess is that the best way to do a solar forge is to plant a coppice lot in trees that make good charcoal, let them gather the solar energy through photosynthesis, and then turn the wood to charcoal and use it in your forge. It's a mature technology and very resilient, unlike complex solar mirror arrays!<br><br>Ruben, thank you! My catabolic collapse theory, for what it's worth, also supports Vail's argument that building a renewable (or nuclear) economy would require an energy surplus we don't have any more. <br><br>Mczilla, I still think the woodstoves and kerosene lamps were the better idea. <br><br>Greatblue, frighteningly true. In fact, most of the contemporary American political class is amazingly ignorant about science; they think of it as a convenient source of miracles, pretty much. <br><br>Strang LA, as I've pointed out before, I'm by no means convinced that nuclear power produces a meaningful amount of net energy at all; once again, even in countries with no cheap fossil fuels, nuclear power has been possible only with massive government subsidies. That said, you're quite right that even if nuclear power were a viable option, America lacks the money, resources, and will to do it.<br><br><a href=#c4999793413908219716 title="comment permalink">3/2/10, 6:20 PM</a><br><br>

If they get 500 MW of output power from 50 MW input, good -- and of course that's much more than anyone else has achieved -- but how many megawatt-hours are needed to build the plant, refine the fuel, deal with the waste, etc., etc., etc.? All that has to be factored into a net energy accounting. With nuclear power -- fusion or fission -- it's these secondary costs that are usually left out of the analysis, and that's why nuclear power seems to make sense on paper and fails so dismally in practice. <br><br>That, in turn, is why oil wins over nuclear power; its secondary costs are much, much lower. One way of measuring that is to think of the energy concentration of nuclear fuels <i>before</i> they're refined, and compare it to that of petroleum or natural gas, say, right out of the well. A pound of pitchblende contains only a very tiny percentage of fissionable uranium, and it takes energy input to concentrate it to the point that the energy in it can be extracted. <br><br>Jason, yes, the brick wall of denial has really started to slip. Whether or not the UK and Argentina can settle this one amicably, expect more skirmishes -- and full-scale shooting wars -- as that reality sinks in. <br><br>Tiago, I've given the reasons why I think nuclear power isn't going to save us. If you find those reasons insufficient, that's certainly your right, but it doesn't change the fact that I find them compelling. If you want to dismiss as a rhetorical device the fact that I only have so many hours in a day, and aren't interested in spending them doing research for people who can just as well do it for themselves, well, once again, that's your right -- but it's not going to affect how I approach these issues. Ultimately, this blog is what it is -- a conceptual exploration of the future using the tools of history, philosophy, and ecological theory -- and if you don't find that satisfying, you know, there are plenty of other blogs you can read. <br><br>Gardenserf, yes it does, and <a href=http://www.theoildrum.com rel=nofollow>The Oil Drum</a> has quite a few detailed discussions on that topic, which I'd encourage you to check out. <br><br>Tim, hmm! That's a fascinating challenge. I'll put some thought into it.<br><br><a href=#c55102529074033307 title="comment permalink">3/2/10, 6:51 PM</a><br><br>

The fact that there's a lot of potential energy in the nuclei of radioactive elements doesn't mean that we can extract that energy and exploit it to any useful degree. <br><br>In my experience, talk about the "possibility" of finding some new highly concentrated energy resource is simply an excuse not to think about the implications of the fact that there is no such animal, at least in this small corner of the universe. Granted, it's impossible to prove a negative; insist that the world is going to be rescued by a vast herd of pink unicorns whose digestive tracts produce enough methane to keep our cars fueled forever, and I can't prove that you're wrong. That fact doesn't make it a good idea to wager the world's future on the arrival of all those unicorns. <br><br>It's probably also necessary to note here that I have never said that we are going back to the stone age or the bronze age; in fact, I've repeatedly explained why I think that's perhaps the least likely future ahead of us. Waving around that particular straw man does not lend any particular dignity to your argument. <br><br>Finally, as I mentioned a little while back, the project of this blog focuses on trying to anticipate the future. It also focuses on trying to make sense of what we know about the predicament of industrial society, rather than hypothesizing that somebody might somehow pull a rabbit out of a hat and save us from the consequences of decades of bad decisions.

A kilowatt hour's worth of diesel fuel to run an earth-mover digging a Nuke plant's foundation is less expensive than a kWh of electric power the nuke plant will eventually sell.

What makes a blog popular these days (in my experience) is not only the quality of the content of the blog, but also the quality of the discussions in each blog post - which some times generate ideas that are more valuable than the ones in the original content of the blog post. I see that while you moderate the posts, that you still post comments that are in disagreement with your views, and just as important, you address each one of them.<br><br>The majority of Peak Oil writers who have blogs also moderate their blogs, and they will <b>not </b>post any comments that are in disagreement with their (often doom and gloom) views. I could name some renowned Peak Oil writers that come to mind, but it's not necessary. For you readers out there, just beware when you read a blog post and then only see comments that praise the author. Rest assured that when my disagreeable comments are not posted, that I no longer and am reader of that blog. Personally, I am interested in reading content and commentaries that promotes critical thinking; and I'm not all interested in reading content that is purely an author's personal agenda followed by a bunch of comments that are nothing but mindless praise for the author. I'm more interested in the challenging comments than the praising ones, because it says a lot about the author (in how he/she responds them).<br><br>Thus my interest in encouraging you to be as unbiased as possible. I do not mean to waste your time in offering views that are opposed to yours for the sake of it. I merely wish to be a contribution to you. As someone here said earlier, "you can take it or leave it". I'll not be offended if you don't take my suggestions, and I will happily continue to read your blog which I very much enjoy. BTW, I'm not trying to change the direction of your blog by any means.<br><br>You must be aware by now, that the breakthrough and development of any future technology that could allow us to harness energy in a way that leaves us independent from fossil fuels would undermine all the work that you have done thus far. That is what I have been wanting to point you to. Is that likely to happen? I think not. But it is possible, and if the flying unicorns do show up, then all of your work will immediately be discredited and ignored. That is the risk that you are taking. That said, I have great admiration and interest in your work, so much so that I have recommended your blog and book (The Long Descent, which I've read) to many other friends, and will continue to do so.<br><br>Lastly, I wanted to say that our personal agenda does have a direct and indirect effect on the future of humanity at large. I.e., if you convince enough people (and you only need to convince a small minority in order to reach critical mass) that there's no chance at all that something will happen, then because everyone *believes* that - that outcome is never produced as a result of no one believing it. The less energy that goes towards something, the less real that thing is. This is the work of Quantum Physics, which is a fairly new science.<br><br>Anyway, please move forward with your work. I look forward to more thought-provoking material from you. And I do not mind if you do not accept my suggestions, especially now that you've made your position clear (so I know where you're coming from). I respect your position. Thank you very much,<br><br>rptizzle<br><br><a href=#c7209241146254708050 title="comment permalink">3/3/10, 12:06 PM</a><br><br>

He has already theorized in The Long Descent that we will move slowly in steps. So his theory already includes unknown flying unicorns that will show up and sustain us for short spurts.<br><br>But in order to be effective as a leader he needs to convince a majority to do those things that will prepare us for when the new flying unicorns give out. Also what do we do if those flying unicorns are only offered to the rich who can pay for them? The possibility that we have American cities with a functioning industrial society for the few and a vast majority living in pre-industrial conditions is a very real possibility. In that case both are correct. No one seems to take into consideration that 3 or 4 possible outcomes as mentioned in the responses in just this blog alone could all be true at the same time. The difference is where you are standing at the moment.<br><br>So I heartily thank Mr Greer for sticking to his guns and attempting to get a system into place in which a large majority may be able to live more comfortably than if we continue doing the same. Unless my lottery retirement plan comes through, it looks like I may be one of the huddled masses living in pre-industrial conditions while I work for those who can afford to live well with the energy from the flying unicorns.<br><br><a href=#c7717970598570535227 title="comment permalink">3/3/10, 3:40 PM</a><br><br>

It doesn't matter that surface insolation is only around 1000W/m^2. In fact sunlight is quite high on the scale of available energy: in principle it's nearly 100% available as work. What you have here is a hot-side reservoir (the sun) that's at a much higher temperature than the cold-side reservoir (the earth's surface), so your Carnot efficiency approaches unity. The inefficiency is that it's difficult to extract the energy at a *continuum* of wavelengths, instead of at just one. With wind, OTOH, I can agree with you: it has already gone through a energy-&gt;heat-&gt;work cycle, and that at a very very low efficiency, before you can extract the energy from it.<br><br><a href=#c6316724709392272507 title="comment permalink">3/13/10, 3:26 PM</a><br><br>
