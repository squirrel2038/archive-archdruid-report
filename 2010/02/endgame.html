I’ve mentioned more than once in these essays the foreshortening effect that textbook history can have on our understanding of the historical events going on around us. The stark chronologies most of us get fed in school can make it hard to remember that even the most drastic social changes happen over time, amid the fabric of everyday life and a flurry of events that can seem more important at the time.<br><br>This becomes especially problematic in times like the present, when apocalyptic prophecy is a central trope in the popular culture that frames a people’s hopes and fears for the future. When the collective imagination becomes obsessed with the dream of a sudden cataclysm that sweeps away the old world overnight and ushers in the new, even relatively rapid social changes can pass by unnoticed. The twilight years of Rome offer a good object lesson; so many people were convinced that the Second Coming might occur at any moment that the collapse of classical civilization went almost unnoticed; only a tiny handful of writers from those years show any recognition that something out of the ordinary was happening at all.<br><br>Reflections of this sort have been much on my mind lately, and there’s a reason for that. Scattered among the statistical noise that makes up most of today’s news are data points that suggest to me that business as usual is quietly coming to an end around us, launching us into a new world for which very few of us have made any preparations at all.<br><br>Here’s one example. Friends of mine in a couple of midwestern states have mentioned that the steady trickle of refugees from the Chicago slums into their communities has taken a sharp turn up. There’s a long history of dysfunction behind this. Back in 1999, Chicago began tearing down its vast empire of huge high-rise projects, promising to replace them with less ghastly and more widely distributed housing for the poor. Most of the replacements, of course, never got built. When the waiting list for Section 8 rent subsidies, the only other option available, got long enough to become a public relations problem, the bureaucrats in charge simply closed the list to new applicants; rumors (hotly denied by the Chicago city government) claim that poor families in Chicago were openly advised to move to other states. Whether for that reason or simple economic survival, a fair number of them did.<br><br>Fast forward to the middle of 2009. Around then, facing budget deficits second only to California, the state of Illinois quietly stopped paying its social service providers. In theory, the money is still allocated; in practice, it’s been more than six months since Illinois preschools, senior centers, food banks, and the like have received a check from the state for the services they provide, and many of them are on the verge of going broke. Subsidized rent has apparently taken an equivalent hit. Believers in free-market economics have been insisting for years that the end of rent subsidies would let the free market reduce rents to a level that people could afford, but I don’t recommend holding your breath; this is the same free market, remember, that gave the United States some of the world’s worst slums in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<br><br>The actual effects have been instructive. Squeezed between sharply contracting benefits and a sharply contracting job market, many of Chicago’s poor are hitting the road, heading in any direction that offers more options. Forget the survivalist fantasy of violent hordes pouring out of the inner cities to ravage everything in their path; today’s slum residents are instead becoming the Okies of the Great Recession. In the process, part of business as usual in the United States is coming to an end.<br><br>Illinois is far from the only state that backed itself into a corner by assuming that rising tax revenues from a bubble economy could be extrapolated indefinitely into the future. 41 US states currently face budget deficits. California has received most of the media attention so far, a good deal of it focused on the political gridlock that has kept the state frozen in crisis for years. Behind the partisan posturing in Sacramento, though, lies a deeper and harsher reality. The state of California is essentially bankrupt; nearly all the mistakes made by the once-wealthy states of the Rust Belt as they slid down the curve of their own decline have been faithfully copied by California as it approaches its destiny as the Rust Belt of the 21st century. I wonder how many local governments in neighboring states have drawn up plans for dealing with the tide of economic refugees once California can no longer pay for its welfare system, and the poor of Los Angeles and other California cities join those of Chicago on the road?<br><br>I could go on, but I think the point has been made. State governments are the canaries in our national coal mine; their tax receipts are one of the very few measures of economic activity that aren’t being systematically fiddled by the federal government. The figures coming out of state revenue offices strike a jarring contrast with the handwaving about “green shoots” and an imminent return to prosperity heard from Washington DC and the media. Across the country, every few months, states that have already cut spending drastically to cope with record declines in tax income find that they have to go back and do it all over again, because their revenue – and by inference, the incomes, purchases, business activity, and other economic phenomena that feed into taxes – has dropped even further. Now it’s true that state budgets get hit whenever the economy goes into recession, and keep on hurting even when the recession is supposed to be over, but compared to past examples, the losses clobbering state funding these days are off the scale, and a great many programs that have been fixtures of American public life for as long as most of us have been living are facing the chopping block.<br><br>A different reality pertains within the Washington DC beltway. Where states that fail to balance their budgets get their bond ratings cut and, in some cases, are having trouble finding buyers for their debt at less than usurious interest rates, the federal government seems to be able to defy the normal behavior of bond markets with impunity. Despite soaring deficits, not to mention a growing disinclination on the part of foreign governments to keep on financing the same, every new issuance of US treasury bills somehow finds buyers in such abundance that interest rates stay remarkably low. A few weeks ago, <a href=http://www.energybulletin.net/node/51248>Tom Whipple of ASPO</a> became the latest in a tolerably large number of perceptive observers who have pointed out that this makes sense only if the US government is surreptitiously buying its own debt.<br><br>The process works something like this. The Federal Reserve, which is not actually a government agency but a consortium of large banks working under a Federal charter, has the statutory right to mint money in the US. These days, that can be done by a few keystrokes on a computer, and another few keystrokes can transfer that money to any bank in the nation. Some of those banks use the money to buy up US treasury bills, probably by way of subsidiaries chartered in the Cayman Islands and the like, and these same off-book subsidiaries then stash the T-bills and keep them off the books. The money thus laundered finally arrives at the US treasury, where it gets spent.<br><br>It may be a bit more complex than that. Those huge sums of money voted by Congress to bail out the financial system may well have been diverted into this process – that would certainly explain why the Department of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York have stonewalled every attempt to trace exactly where all that money went. Friendly foreign governments may also have a hand in the process. One way or another, though, those of my readers who remember the financial engineering that got Enron its fifteen minutes of fame may find all this uncomfortably familiar – and it is. The world’s largest economy has become, in effect, the United States of Enron.<br><br>Plenty of countries in the past have tried to cover expenses that overshot income by spinning the presses at the local mint. The result is generally hyperinflation, of the sort made famous in the 1920s by Germany and more recently by Zimbabwe. That I know of, though, nobody has tried the experiment with a national economy in a steep deflationary depression, of the sort that has been taking shape in America and elsewhere since the real estate bubble crashed and burned in 2008. In theory, at least in the short term, it might just work; the inflationary pressures caused by printing money wholesale could conceivably cancel out the deflationary pressures of a collapsing bubble and a contracting economy – at least for a while.<br><br>The difficulty, of course, is that pumping the money supply fixes the symptoms of economic failure without treating the causes, and in every case I know of, governments that resort to it end up caught on a treadmill that requires ever larger infusions of paper money just to maintain the status quo. Sooner or later, as the amount of currency in circulation outstrips the goods and services available to buy, inflation spins out of control, the currency loses most or all of its value, and the economy grinds to a halt until a new currency can be issued on some sounder basis. In 1920s Germany, they managed this last feat by taking out a mortgage on the entire country, and issued “Rentenmarks” backed by that mortgage. In the wake of the late housing bubble, that seems an unlikely option here, though no doubt some gimmick will be found.<br><br>It’s crucial to realize, though, that this move comes at the end of a long historical trajectory. From the early days of the industrial revolution into the early 1970s, the United States possessed the immense economic advantage of sizable reserves of whatever the cutting-edge energy source happened to be. During what Lewis Mumford called the eotechnic era, when waterwheels were the prime mover for industry and canals were the core transportation technology, the United States prospered because it had an abundance of mill sites and internal waterways. During Mumford’s paleotechnic era, when coal and railways replaced water and canal boats, the United States once again found itself blessed with huge coal reserves, and the arrival of the neotechnic era, when petroleum and highways became the new foundation of power, the United States found that nature had supplied it with so much oil that in 1950, it produced more petroleum than all other countries combined.<br><br>That trajectory came to an abrupt end in the 1970s, when nuclear power – expected by nearly everyone to be the next step in the sequence – turned out to be hopelessly uneconomical, and renewables proved unable to take up the slack. The neotechnic age, in effect, turned out to have no successor. Since then, for most of the last thirty years, the United States has been trying to stave off the inevitable – the sharp downward readjustment of our national standard of living and international importance following the peak and decline of our petroleum production and the depletion of most of the other natural resources that once undergirded American economic and political power. We’ve tried accelerating drawdown of natural resources; we’ve tried abandoning our national infrastructure, our industries, and our agricultural hinterlands; we’ve tried building ever more baroque systems of financial gimmickry to prop up our decaying economy with wealth from overseas; over the last decade and a half, we’ve resorted to systematically inflating speculative bubbles – and now, with our backs to the wall, we’re printing money as though there’s no tomorrow.<br><br>Now it’s possible that the current US administration will be able to pull one more rabbit out of its hat, and find a new gimmick to keep things going for a while longer. I have to confess that this does not look likely to me. Monetizing the national debt, as economists call the attempt to pay a nation’s bills by means of a hyperactive printing press, is a desperation move; it’s hard to imagine any reason that it would have been chosen if there were any other option in sight.<br><br>What this means, if I’m right, is that we may have just moved into the endgame of America’s losing battle with the consequences of its own history. For many years now, people in the peak oil scene – and the wider community of those concerned about the future, to be sure – have had, or thought they had, the luxury of ample time to make plans and take action. Every so often books would be written and speeches made claiming that something had to be done right away, while there was still time, but most people took that as the rhetorical flourish it usually was, and went on with their lives in the confident expectation that the crisis was still a long ways off.<br><br>We may no longer have that option. If I read the signs correctly, America has finally reached the point where its economy is so deep into overshoot that catabolic collapse is beginning in earnest. If so, a great many of the things most of us in this country have treated as permanent fixtures are likely to go away over the years immediately before us, as the United States transforms itself into a Third World country. The changes involved won’t be sudden, and it seems unlikely that most of them will get much play in the domestic mass media; a decade from now, let’s say, when half the American workforce has no steady work, decaying suburbs have mutated into squalid shantytowns, and domestic insurgencies flare across the south and the mountain West, those who still have access to cable television will no doubt be able to watch talking heads explain how we’re all better off than we were in 2000.<br><br>Those of my readers who haven’t already been beggared by the unraveling of what’s left of the economy, and have some hope of keeping a roof over their heads for the foreseeable future, might be well advised to stock their pantries, clear their debts, and get to know their neighbors, if they haven’t taken these sensible steps already. Those of my readers who haven’t taken the time already to learn a practical skill or two, well enough that others might be willing to pay or barter for the results, had better get a move on. Those of my readers who want to see some part of the heritage of the present saved for the future, finally, may want to do something practical about that, and soon. I may be wrong – and to be frank, I hope that I’m wrong – but it looks increasingly to me as though we’re in for a very rough time in the very near future.

I expect my life will be shorter than I once thought it might be, because 1) there will likely be situations where I don't have much choice about what I will eat, 2) the medical-industrial complex will founder along with everything else (I expect that to be a very mixed sort of blessing), 3) insulin shots might not be an option for me by the time I need them, 4) I am already experiencing pretty advanced hypertenstion (my nonmedicated blood pressure tends to be 150/100). I'm not trying to be all "poor me", though it may sound that way. It's just that there's pretty much an army of diabetics out there right now thanks to high fructose corn syrup and unhealthy lifestyles, and how those of us so afflicted will cope will no doubt be an interesting chapter in the story of collapse.<br><br><a href=#c916463804117146474 title="comment permalink">2/3/10, 11:42 PM</a><br><br>

You have just given us one one of those moments when you metaphorically "pat your pockets" to be sure that you have your contingency plans in place. <br><br>My partner and I were talking earlier today about the way politicians, bloggers, and friends all respond to "doom and gloom" (i.e. anyone highlighting a problem without providing a solution that lets them continue with business as usual). The common theme is: "if I can't have business as usual, then don't upset me with this talk". <br><br>Which brings me to my point: we feel that we (unlike our friends and family) have now reached a level of 100% psychological preparedness for whatever comes (which has taken us about five years). <br><br>Right now, here in Australia we aren't seeing the kinds of things that you mention (welfare programs being cut, people being displaced), but we are getting hammered by the environment with our ongoing drought. Come what may, major changes (social, economic, environmental, or a combination of factors) won't take us by surprise, and we won't be dying of broken hearts for loss of our iPhones etc.<br><br>It is thanks to a steady stream of information from people like you, JMG, that we have been able to build a picture of the various risks that our society is facing and take appropriate action to mitigate those risks. It seems unlikely in the extreme that business will continue as usual for the rest of our lives, but should that happen, then we will be living a simple, comfortable, and fullfilling life anyway.<br><br><a href=#c8168461028424222078 title="comment permalink">2/4/10, 1:37 AM</a><br><br>

Our society is in big trouble, that's for sure, and hardly anyone is hearing the signals among all the noise. You certainly have heard the signals that so many others have missed. (I was unaware of the welfare-class migration out of Chicago, for example). Most everyone else is caught up in the noise. Some signals I've noticed: the trials and tribulations of the auto industry, including Toyota's current QC problems; the proliferation of abandoned commercial properties across our landscape; the incredible political gridlock in Washington, characterized by fearfulness among elected leaders, including the president; increasingly viewing gambling as a "solution" to government budget and revenue problems; and the growing chorus of strident demagoguery, exemplified by the 'tea party' movement.<br><br>Regarding state budget dilemmas, our state (Ohio) has been bleeding red for years. The only reason our current biennial budget can be marked "balanced" is bailout money from Washington. They're projecting a $4-5 billion shortfall for the next biennial, beginning in 2011, with no apparent prospect for collecting that amount of money. Meanwhile, the legislature has placed a proposal on the next statewide ballot to sell $700 million in state-issued bonds for creating "high-tech jobs". And the Republican candidate for governor is campaigning partly on eliminating the state income tax but with no proposal, so far as I know, for making up the lost revenue.<br><br>My wife works for the state historical society. They also manage the state archives, so they are partly state funded. But the state has been slowly starving the organization over the past eight or nine years. They've had six or seven rounds of layoffs in that time, and they're currently about two more budget cuts away from closing the doors for good.<br><br>Regarding apocalypticism, one of my students recently wrote an essay about a visit he made to a friend's church--a prominently located church clearly visible from the interstate. He said the pastor ranted about the coming end of the world and warned his flock that the government would soon begin implanting microchips on our bodies, to be used for identification. They would also become our credit and debit cards. They would excuse it by saying it would help prevent identity theft.<br><br>I told the student about David Icke and the evil space lizards.<br><br><a href=#c3470762922582893959 title="comment permalink">2/4/10, 6:46 AM</a><br><br>

Well researched, well written, with a wonder tone.<br><br>I do believe we are now past the Hubbert Peak for America's global influence and standard of living. Our peak household earnings occurred just as Generation X was being born. Funny how America's Hubbert Peak in petroleum production occurred about the same time. <br><br>I have a few open ended questions. How much debt has been added in the last 40 years? How much debt will we add in the next four years? Who is going to pay for all this spending? When do we bring the Army home? When do we address the enormity of end-of-life Medicare costs? When do we deal with the coming obesity/diabetes time bomb? What happens when housing prices drop back to 3x earnings? What happens when those earnings drop by 30% in a decade of global wage arbitrage? What happens when the borrowing stops and we must live within our means? Do we have any plan?<br><br>I am still an optimist. Our standard of living will correct to something more sustainable. We will earn less, spend less, consume less, travel less, and eat less. We will live in smaller homes, produce goods and services locally, and finally start to grow more of our own food. We will rebuild our local communities and local organizations. Trust will replace contracts. Money will replace debt. Communities will replace city/state/federal programs. <br> There will be pain along they way. Who wants to give up the American lifestyle? Once our nation adjusts, we will rediscover the community spirit that made us Americans.<br><br><a href=#c6946662867045626972 title="comment permalink">2/4/10, 8:15 AM</a><br><br>

You might also look into simple oil lamps, which are easy to make and use. As for diabetes, you've touched on one of the bitter dimensions of all this -- a lot of people with health problems that were manageable in a high-energy society will die of them in the deindustrial future, just as they would have died of them before the 20th century. <br><br>Conchshooter, don't count on those tourists for much longer. <br><br>LB, good.

I've talked about that in some detail, as a future possibility; now, if I'm right, it's under way. Hang on tight. <br><br>Yourmindfire, thank you! Ibn Khaldun's writings on history deserve a lot more attention than they get these days -- it's good to see the Beeb giving him some publicity. <br><br>Llewellyn, that's what I'm hearing. <br><br>Jason, given that the UK housing bubble was even more extreme than ours, I confess to a certain skepticism over the government's claim that the recession is over. I think a temporary slowing in the rate of decline has been mistaken for a bottom. <br><br>Disillusioned, by 2030 the US will no longer be a superpower.

Sometimes, I think, he gets caught up in exactly the foreshortening of history I mentioned early in this post, and expects things to unravel faster than they will, but his basic vision of the end of an age of abundance and its associated lifestyles is no different from the one I've been talking about here. <br><br>You could add any number of things to the list of signs that things are going very, very wrong. The one I nearly wrote about this week has been usefully discussed by Damien Perrotin in <a href=http://theviewfrombrittany.blogspot.com/ rel=nofollow>his reliably thoughtful blog</a>: the abandonment of the Constellation spaceflight program by the US government. When the space shuttles go out of service a few years from now, for the first time since 1960, the US will have no manned spaceflight program and no plans to reestablish one. That marks the end of an age as forcefully as anything I can imagine.<br><br><a href=#c2734432723607672179 title="comment permalink">2/4/10, 10:48 AM</a><br><br>

Now factor in the society's capacity for homeostatic response, and also the extent to which scrapping and salvaging existing capital of all kinds can temporarily replace exhausted natural resources.

Every pipeline from the tar sands heads south to the U.S. Quebec already exports vast amounts of hydro to the U.S. The only ways to get more are to ramp up production at the tar sands and/or to leave less for Canadians. I doubt the U.S. government will have a problem with this, but it could stir rebellious action from Canadians, and pipelines and hydro lines are notoriously difficult to protect.<br><br><a href=#c3078039623914834297 title="comment permalink">2/4/10, 11:32 AM</a><br><br>

It works like this, make a corrupt regime take a huge loan for "development investment" meaning swiss bank accounts for few selected locals and rest of the money for big Western corporation hired to do the "development work". To pay of the interests of the loan in foreign currency - dollars - all future governements are bound to make their country produce and export what rich consumers in rich countriess want instead of what their people need. The details of how this is done are explained in the book "Memoirs of an economic hitman". <br> <br>Joelsanda: re comparison with Rome and why Cuba could be exception - I recommend reading the classic conservationist book "Topsoil and Civilization" from 1955 that shows that all previous civilizations have collapsed because of unsustainable farming methods and cutting forests causing erosion silting and using up natural resources. The writers were hopefull that we could learn from the past but with industrial mechanized aggriculture and "green revolution" of poisoning soil and using up groundwater to produce vulnerable monoculture crops with massive input of fossile fuels the situation has got infinitely worse.<br><br>As for Cuba, thanks to socialist economy being not fundamentally grounded on idea of continuous economic growth plus US embargo forcing Cubans to trust themselves and uncorrupted by IMF and World Bank etc., they had the social cohesion and political wisdom to transform into intensive low tech small scale organic gardening during the Special Period.

May I give a quick reference to historical cycle of collapse. There are 4 stages. Out of a time of revolution or anarchy, a leader will arise. He rules by strength of arms and brings rule of law to a territory. Stage 1 is rule by strength. As more territory is conquered, it becomes too complicated for one man to manage the details. The leader appoints wise men to be his deputies. Stage 2 is rule by the intelligent. The leader eventually becomes a figurehead. Smart men are running the nation allowing it to become productive. To keep a nation productive it must be stable. Laws, rules and bureaucrats take over. Red tape from city hall is a way of keeping things from falling apart. Stage 3 is bureaucracy. When trade is regulated, the first thing bought and sold are regulators. Political power becomes profitable. Eventually it takes wealth to achieve political power. It takes political power to achieve wealth. Stage 4 is oligarchy, rule by the rich. Wealth becomes concentrated at the top by polititians who write laws to profit themselves. The middle class is forced down into the masses at the economic bottom of society. Until stage 4 a dynamic, intelligent individual can move upwards in society. When those avenues are blocked, the only way to riches and power is to collapse the system. In revolution the motto is often, "He came from the masses", "He is one of us". The system collapses and restarts with a dynamic leader out of a time of revolution or anarchy. <br><br>Crane Brinton adds one important point in his book, Anatomy of Revolution. If those in power defend the system, revolution is unsuccessful. Unfortunately those in power today seem to be "globalists" instead of america first. This factor would predict a collapse rather than a reset of the system.<br><br>Want a list of warning signs? The US Army declassified the 547 indicators of state collapse index. You have to read between the lines to see what is happening from inside rather than watching it from the outside. Example; warning sign is fresh food disapears from markets. Inside viewpoint either the money is worthless or individuals are storing it instead of selling it. It does give an overview of how a society comes unglued. A personal note, if you use this to write an end of the world as we know it novel, it may trigger a visit by the homeland security folks.<br><br>People here have asked for some point of hope in this discussion. You will find one if you have a pragmatic view of a collapse. Educate yourself on how bad things could be. If 30% of the population is doomed, like the great plague, you do not have to be 90% prepared. You only have to be in the 70% that survive. If half the people are doomed, you do not have to be 99% prepared in a food stockpiled underground bunker. You only have to be better prepared than the 50% that don't make it. Knowing there may be a problem coming puts you ahead of a large portion of the population. Having a place to go away from danger adds if you get there in time. Skills, adaptability, youth, family, nonpower tools, books, seeds, weapons all increase your chances. For free you can learn about local wild foods or medicinal plants. For free you can participate in the SCA and learn a wide range of pre-tech skills, www.SCA.org<br><br>JMG used the masons as an example of a community. I see a more realistic example in inner city gangs. They form for mutual protection in an environment that lacks safety and economic opportunity. The average person today would more likely end up in Hooverville or the current tent city Obamaville (Google it). Don't think heading for the woods is a viable option. You could do it but imagine the thousands of clueless campers leaving thier campfires unattended around you. If nature could support people with a minimum of knowlege and effort, the woods and not the cities would be filled with homeless people already. <br><br>DocFont<br><br><a href=#c2966236787329065368 title="comment permalink">2/4/10, 4:48 PM</a><br><br>

As for "altering the system in a meaningful way," er, the time for that is long past. The system is altering itself, starting along a trajectory of uncontrolled radical simplification that will reduce the number of people it will support to a fairly small fraction of current levels.

Interestingly whilst your blog focuses on peak oil, resource depletion in general is a growing concern. In recent years I have had changed my life from the corporate bad lands to on the road to self sufficiency in the forests in South Eastern Australia. One thing that your readers may not be aware of is the large dependence of big agriculture on oil and that it takes 10 calories of oil to produce 1 calorie of food. Not very efficient. At the same time, the readers of this blog may not be specifically aware that we are coming to the peak of phosphate production. Agriculture is hugely dependent on this one product. The upshot is that at some time in the near future we're all going to be a lot hungrier than we are today. The only sensible strategy is to learn about food growth and production, seed storage, soil management. Without super phosphates production of the large quantities of food is only possible through the emulation of natural systems and these take years to set up. It simply can't happen overnight. People on this blog refer to Cuba as an example of local food production and this situation only succeeded because Cuba is a dictatorship and as such can be single minded about the implementation of any policy. Agriculture is difficult, risky and subject to the whims of nature. The only reason we have such a large population of humans in the first place is through the exploitation of the natural systems and the ability to trade and move food products huge distances. Without oil this will be impossible and much of the population will starve. If I could recommend one act to everyone out there that is to get into gardening and improve your soil with natural methods because you are going to need it shortly!<br><br><a href=#c4926729331666019235 title="comment permalink">2/5/10, 3:54 AM</a><br><br>

That would be one of the bloodiest mistake the US wculd do. The last successful US invasion was Grenada! Declining empires cant even preserve their borders, even less expend them. Thinking that an army could just walk over a country the size and ruggedness of Canada and take control without the population sabotaging all the infrastructures is ludicrous. When the gas pipelines, the oil fields and the electrical grid shut down and plundge a fair chunck of the US in the dark, then what? You dont need missiles, tanks and air carriers to conquer and subsequently control Canada, you need icebreakers: the US has 4 of them, Canada over 20. Bottom line, you dont mess up with your most secure source of energy the same as you dont shoot the surgeon who's operating over you dying body. A more likely scenario is massive waves of emigration North of the border in a fashion similar to the one described by JMG for Australia.<br><br>On a more constructive note: althought this is not an option for many people, there are opportunities for people to partner with existing farmers. The farmers are aging (less than 6% are under 35 year old) and in many case, there is nobody to take over. The lack of economic opportunities have dried out the pool of skilled labour. Many would like to stay on their farms, cant afford to hire employees and look for the 'right" partners. A good first stop is the International Farm Transition Network (http://www.farmtransition.org/) which through "Farm Link" matches willing beginners with farmers. <br>Also, I strongly suggest for non-farmers to join a CSA. Urban gardens can only do so much, we will still need farms to produce enough of the staples (grains, pulses, meat and dairy) to supply urban centres. Despite all the cries of the vegetarian crowd, in many regions, the most sensible, energy efficent and sustainable way to produce enough quality fats and proteins is animal/intensive grazing agriculture. Grazing animals can metabolize cellulose and use land that cant be cultivated. That's why the Swiss drink milk and eat lots of cheese and not soymilk. Look at what the people were producing locally 100 years ago, that is a good indicator of what you should support your local farmers to grow or to raise.<br><br><a href=#c2947396981302952750 title="comment permalink">2/5/10, 7:58 AM</a><br><br>

I do think you could have mentioned that the prime reason for state budget shortfalls is the sheer cost of the fiduciary promises made to those state workers with overly generous and indexed defined benefit pension plans and lifetime health plans usually negotiated by their unionized state employee unions. I personally know an individual, a retired 51 year old SF Fireman with a high school degree drawing 90% of his salary earning $132,000 courtesy of the CA taxpayer. Ticket takers at BART earn in the mid 80's per annum. The average DC federal worker earns $76,800 per year. The number of state,federal and other public sector employees exceeds the number of workers in the manufacturing sector by over 4 million. Manufacturing is now only 12% of GDP. With this many overpaid people making nothing of value burdening the states and counties with vast underfunded mandates, collapse is not far off. And the states instead of cutting salaries and benefits and retirement commensurate with the working stiffs in their states are demanding no cuts, not now, not ever. The situation is not that dissimilar in Greece and the other PIGS countries in Europe. It is not just the US who will be 3rd world. We will have a lot of company. Our debt to GDP is almost 130% if you include the GSE(Agency) debt of Fannie/Freddy. IMO, we are looking at a deflationary, not inflationary collapse, at least near term. When? Who knows. Your advice is sound. Save money, pay off debts, learn a skill, feed yourself and be prepared to work a lot harder and walk a lot further in the future. All that Type 2 Diabetes will eventually just be a memory.<br><br><a href=#c864958712101111815 title="comment permalink">2/5/10, 3:46 PM</a><br><br>

My guess is that this one in particular is right on the money. <br><br>Erin, thanks for the clarification. For what it's worth, I think you're quite right about inner cities and the like -- places that don't have far to fall, won't fall far. It's for that reason among others that I moved last year to an old mill town in the Appalachians; people here are used to scraping by on less, community organizations are strong because they have to be, and things are no worse now than they've been for years. There aren't a lot of community gardens, but plenty of backyards bear pretty impressive crops every fall. <br><br>Pops, get those coppices going. Other than that, it sounds as though you've done just about as much as you can under the circumstances. <br><br>Koho, yes, I could have gotten into the nitty gritty, but I suspect a lot of the people who read this blog read <a href=http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/ rel=nofollow>Mish</a>, just as you and I do. As for the deflation/inflation debate, I think they're both right. At the moment we're seeing hard deflation due to the spontaneous combustion of trillions of dollars of imaginary wealth; the reaction of most of the world's nations, though, is to manufacture even more hallucinatory wealth by spinning the presses. In the longer run, that pretty much guarantees hyperinflation. The resulting whipsaw will make life highly interesting for the next few decades. <br><br>Vic, thanks for the Orwell reference! I'll look it up. You're right that an American public school education these days is pretty much a guarantee of effective ignorance about most things that matter. The reasons are complex; the fact is inescapable, and one of the big challenges of the middle future will be finding some way to provide people with an education that actually educates. <br><br>Houner, thank you! I probably could have chosen any of half the other states in the union as an example, but the exodus from the Chicago slums was the data point that got me started. A good many of the rural counties in Illinois, and in many other states, could end up doing quite well; best of luck to you. <br><br>Endif, true enough.

The National Review is not usually on my reading list, but here is a good summary of what is happening: http://article.nationalreview.com/417562/abusing-tarp/stephen-spruiell<br>Where is the outrage?? The tea-partiers, alas, seem beholden to corporatist interests and just don't get it, by and large, unable or unwilling to really connect the dots.<br>Meanwhile, the states are broke. So why couldn't the states be defined as "banks" somehow, and be allowed to use the same trick, with the profits from T-bills helping cover their deficits? Heck, why don't we all get some 0% interest loans we can each invest in federal debt? It makes just as much sense, but the people get the profit.<br>In lieu of such a fantasy, I propose we re-instate the top marginal tax rate of 90% from the 1950s for all bonuses in excess of 10% of base pay in a given year. Voila, at least we'd get some of the money back. <br>But this will not happen, and the long descent is indeed likely upon us.

Personally, I feel very sorry for any politicians conscious about the unfolding tragedy. They must feel totally trapped in a madhouse and powerless. As long as the politicians can only get elected by saying what people "want" to hear versus what they "need" to hear, we are marching to the cliff like a bunch of blissfully and willfully ignorant lemmings. <br><br>Fixing things is as simple and as difficult as treating a diehard alcoolic: the cure is obvious but the patient dont want to give up his addiction. The dynamics driving the vast majority is like the movie "Leaving Las Vegas" on steroids. People will fight for what they want and what they believe they are entitled to, even if it does not make any sense in the long run and it spell for the planet and their own children a world of miseries:<br>*SUV<br>*plastic packaging<br>*cheap food<br>*right to have many kids as they want<br>*over the top end of life care<br>*1000 miles salad bowl<br>*disposable diapers<br>*cell phone coverage in the middle of nowhere<br>etc...<br>The problem now that is even if our junkie make it trought rehab, his liver, brain, kidney etc...have sustained permanent damages. Sadly, many of the intractable problems we have today were totally predictable and preventable. For example, garbage. A five years old can figure in two minutes that it does not make any sense to allow any kind of non-biodegradable packaging to make it to a landfill. But it gives the Almighty Convenience to billions of consummers and there was a pile of profits to make. There you have the perfect combo: the addicts and their enablers. And now we sink load of money and resources for the whole garbage disposal affair and have continents of plastic debris choking the oceans. In a democracy propped up by big business, the poor political bastard who would have suggest banning plastic bottles would have been drowned under the voices of the lobbies, crucified on the public place and accused of dictatorship. The only thing which could have work is massive consummers boycott and those never happened because the throwaway lifestyle is so easy and entrenched. The whole madness will stop when Mother Nature will make her Grand Stand. And she's knocking at the door like a debt collector on a mission. The only option that makes any sense for those who see it coming, is to do what pragmatic farmers in Northern countries have done for centuries when they know winter is on its way: you preserve as many of your best seeds as you can, reduce your herd to your most valuable breeding animals, hunker down and pray Spring will come again. Last year was like an early frost. We may have a few days of good weather, but the wise fellow knows its time to dig the potatoes, make sure there is enough wood in the shed.

However, the post has left me with a nagging thought at the back of my head today as I was owner building my house that end of the world proclamations are a part of our history and culture and there is a certain attractiveness/appeal in this to the human mindset. I'm an atheist and acknowledge that these ideas have their basis in Judaeo - Christian history.<br><br>Anyway, as you've quite correctly pointed out the current economic situation in the US is unsustainable. The level of government debt to GDP is 60% (this may be outdated now - Australia runs at about 4% and this makes headlines here). No bank would ever finance a business with this level of debt to income. As someone who doesn't live within the US perhaps I shouldn't comment, however I can't understand how your politicians stand for election on policies including tax breaks and subsidies. In one of your previous blogs you mentioned that the wealthy paid much higher rates of taxes in the not too distant past. To me the current situation seems like a case of self interest over that of the common good. Once self interest becomes the driving force in a culture, that culture is envetiably doomed to fail as the political process gets captured by interest groups, individuals and corporations. There is also great inertia to change as you've quite correctly pointed out before. This is happening here as well, and it is simply not possible to please everybody as resources are finite and demands are infinite (the basic economic problem). <br><br>However, I disagree with you on the timescale of economic collapse. I recently read Paul Roberts book "The End of Oil" and understand the nexus between cheap oil supplies and US economic growth in the real econcomy (products and services as you'd put it). Generally the countries that have loaned the US funds will want to be repaid those funds. You only have to look at the reluctance of the first world to write off the debt of the third world. As such I think that those countries (namely Saudi Arabia and China) will continue to loan money to the US for a short while yet. I can't even pretend to understand how printing additional US notes will be perceived by these countries. They may try to move global trade to another currency which would have major ramifications for the US economy (Saddam Hussein tried this with oil by tying it to the Euro and look what happened to Iraq). Rather than ending with a bang it will probably be a wimper and with globalisation being so pervasive it will spread outwards from there. Hopefully there will be time to build a localised economy, you can already see it happening, but it is too slow.<br><br>Anyway I approve of your move to a small rural area as i have also done the same thing for much the same reasons. The thing that these communities have that larger communities don't is resilience and structures in place already to support the communities.<br><br>Good luck and I hope that we are all wrong.<br><br><a href=#c2831967010356357510 title="comment permalink">2/8/10, 12:03 AM</a><br><br>

Thatcher and <i>public choice</i> zealots were literally talking about societies on the verge of collapse - and their <i>apocalyptic</i> prophecies were somehow taken most seriously! The "big government <i>road to serfdom</i>" became such an effective scare, even if with 100 times more <i>useful</i> rhetorics than serious empirical analysis. Now you have it: impotent states, dismantled communities and social institutions, <i>incentivized</i> bureaucrats flunking most effectively, and no social mechanisms to impede disastrous courses. And a really painful collapse is only starting.<br><br>States are now here to get broken or become failed. Their budgets were ok the last two decades only because there were still public assets to sell. Now the model of <i>prosperity</i> thorough privatization and lowering taxes is hitting application boundaries hard. Public policy was never so suicidal - <i>free people</i> may rejoice. <br><br>When the downslope of material resources becomes visible, mutual human exploitation and financial <i>sorcery</i> are the last <i>indepletable</i> resources. When prosperity is measured by the quantity of money, then a need of credit bubbles is very obvious. Subprime or nor subprime, extended credits literally create money - banks put up new accounts while still having the same obligations to previous depositors. Deep down, abstracted then paperized and dematerialized again, money is <i>made of <b>promises</b></i>. A boom of credit promises can hide a material decline, and indeed may make the economy very lively for some time. The peak of monetary quantity was actually just before the financial collapse - yet no strong inflation with so much stupid credit, tax cuts and other <i>supply sides</i>. Now it is deleveraging of ongoing debts that is creating those inflation-or-deflation <i>paradoxes</i>. As Krugman argues, Obama’s public <i>stimuli</i> do not really match the deleveraging train. And why so investors still buy his bonds eagerly? What else can they do with their nice millions?! Just as the common folk has a problem of combing for money, some others have the opposite problem how to realize their zillions of credit privileges. Money is just a balance of promises, remember. A couple of examples (Weimar, Zimbabwe) will let the public think that all is understood about money - then it is convenient to put tabus on sensible policies. My own direct observation in Eastern Europe is that rising salaries “run up” inflation far too fast for the supposed demand cycle - much simpler, entrepreneurs apparently just wish to cover <i>rising labour costs</i> and keep profit shares then.<br><br><a href=#c3565258562462032330 title="comment permalink">2/8/10, 1:54 AM</a><br><br>

It was a modest start, and so this year I'll look for some more space to grow a larger crop. <br><br>I would be interested to know whether a list exists which outlines the skills or activities which would be useful to know in years ahead - although many have been discussed by thoughtful posters on this site, and I can make a few educated guesses on my own.<br><br>By training, I'm a graphic designer although I work exclusively in web design, a profession which I'm not sure will be very important in years to come. For this reason, I found particularly troubling the post from some months back about the possibility that rising energy costs will change the energy-hungry internet from what it is today (freely accessible to anyone) to something much more restricted at best.<br><br>The internet is not perfect, but it would be a shame if some of its features collapsed - for me personally, I would hate to see Wikipedia go, blogs such is this one, basic services like email, in general the sharing of information and the ability for people with specialized interests to contact and share knowledge with each other. I don't these things are important only for their own sake, but to have a communications medium to hopefully minimize some of the uglier aspects of descent.<br><br>In this context, forgive me for writing here an idea without regard to the difficulties involved in making it happen, but it might useful to have a kind of computer built around permanence - computers nowadays are designed to be replaced in a few years, but this PermaPuter (haha) would be designed somehow to use less complex parts, to be easily repaired by non-experts, and to use parts recycled from discarded obsolete computers.

The endgame we're now entering will take years to play out, possibly even a couple of decades, and it's not the end of everything -- simply the breakdown of the current economic system in the US and the emergence of what might best be called a Third World economy here. From a broader perspective, it's simply one of the speedbumps on the long road down from Hubbert's peak. <br><br>Faoladh, the thing that fascinates me is that the US has exerted so little military force in Latin America of late. If this were fifty years ago, new governments would long since have been installed in Venezuela, Bolivia and Brazil on the points of US Marine bayonets. Domination of Latin America was the foundation of the US empire; that it's slipped so far is a sign of just how close to breakdown that empire has become. <br><br>Das Monde, I think we'll see in the longer run that what you've called financial sorcery -- mind you, I know sorcerers who would take offense at being compared to the folks on Wall Street who are responsible for this stuff -- is depletable after all; at a certain point, people simply stop believing in a money system that's become too obviously worthless.<br><br>Justin, the only way a "permaputer" is going to get built is if somebody like you, who wants one badly enough, invests the personal time and energy to make it happen.

Few will have the courage to bite the hand that feeds them.<br><br>Nuclear is one of very worst solutions to energy shortages that will be pushed in the near future. Among the many problems, an unstable climate with increasing occurances of heat wave which make nuclear energy at best, unreliable, at worst, an environmental nightmare. Nuclear reactors need large quantity of cold water for cooling. In Europe, over the past years, many nuclear reactors had reduced output or had to be shut down during heat waves. To avoid shutting down reactors, they allowed release of water at warmer temperature than regulations consider safe for fishes. The Browns Ferry reactor in Tennessee experienced the same problems in 2007. Its also very expensive. The French nuclear program has been economically viable because it's fuelled on decommissioned weapons. And franckly, it is immoral to encourage uranium mining considering the nuclear waste legacy to future generations and the fallout on miners and communities living near the mines, among them radon exposure. With some luck, the push to ban uranium mining will pick momentum as central governments, urban centres and corporations loose the economic power to impose their will on rural satellite regions.<br><br><a href=#c3726868470205985215 title="comment permalink">2/8/10, 12:42 PM</a><br><br>

(Like JMG, I believe it has begun, and whatever recovery comes will not return us anywhere close to the recent glory days of mindless consumption.)<br><br>Everything will not fall apart tomorrow. Our first 'step down' will mean a lot of people simply cannot find work, houses lose value, companies go bankrupt, etc - but even during the Great Depression 75% were still employed. JMG expects each stage of the crisis to last 10-25 years, if I recall correctly, followed by a partial recovery. <br><br>Given that, it makes sense to seek out 'income opportunities' - forget about jobs - that suit the new reality. I wrote about this in Depression-resistant Promising Businesses – and Fields to Abandon (http://www.briangordon.ca/2010/02/depression-resistant-promising-businesses-%E2%80%93-and-fields-to-abandon/).<br><br>The point is that there will be some degree of normalcy for this new era, barring a sudden collapse brought on by someone bombing the Saudi oil fields or similar. Insulin will likely continue to be available for this first step down and for the partial recovery, so diabetics have some time. There is no need to become a subsistence farmer just yet, as you can bet that declining supplies of oil and money will be directed to factory farms - nothing produces revolution faster than hungry people.<br><br>But now is the time to build useful skills, to pay off debt, to get a solar house with garden space, and so on.

One sentence stood out for me. <br><br>"If I read the signs correctly, America has finally reached the point where its economy is so deep into overshoot that catabolic collapse is beginning in earnest."<br><br>Key phrase in there is "if I read the signs correctly". That's what I want to write to you about. This may not be the appropriate place, but I'm not sure how to contact you otherwise.<br><br>I heard you speak at the Peak Oil Conference in Oakland Hills a few years ago. I bought your book The Long Decline at that conference,and read it with interest. Following your lead, I then went on to purchase and read William Catton's Overshoot. That was a great book. I've read it a couple of times since then.<br><br>In The Long Decline, and in your posts here, you tell us that our decline is not going to be a sudden collapse back to the pre-fossil fuel standard of living, but rather a series of falls that are then followed by some uptick of properity. In essence we will go down (standard of living wise), not in one big step, but in a series a steps. Kind of like three steps down, and then two steps up. Decline will be gradual, but inexorable.<br><br>I don't know if that is correct. But here's why I am writing today. I've been reading the works of R. N. Elliott, developer of the Elliott Wave Theory, and the works of his most prominent disciple, Robert Prechter and his crew at Elliott Wave International. I think Elliott's work maps onto your work in very interesting ways. Both of you suggest that social change happens in waves or steps.<br><br>Elliott's assertion is that economic activity is determined by social mood. When social mood is positive (optimistic), it leads to booms. When social mood turns negative (pessimistic), it leads to busts. In the 1940s, Elliott predicted what we have seen over the past ten years. He predicted a big burst of positive social mood (with accompanying large stock market mania) which would be followed by a very significant downturn in mood and material fortunes. He suggested, and Prechter agrees, that this downtown would be of a more significant degree than what was seen in the last Great Depression. But, he also said that this large decline would then be followed by a new uptick of mood and prosperity.<br><br>The signs that Elliott (and Prechter et. al) watch are the wave formations drawn by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the various indicators of social mood that our society provides.<br><br>If you have not already done so, I encourage you to look into Elliott and Prechter's work.

It is clear that the Greek debacle is breaking up the EU (as I predicted back in 2005) and that this has triggered the implosion of the derivatives bubble which I would still estimate at around $700 trillion.

He spoke often of his days in pharmacy school back in the 1940's, where a crotchety old professor insisted that the students, in order to pass his course, be able to identify a long list of medicinal herbs in dried form, locate the ones available locally in the wild, and describe how to use them. The rest of the faculty used to make fun of him. He retired, and such things were no longer taught in that school of pharmacy. I doubt that they are taught anywhere these days. My friend used to occasionally go out in the woods and keep his skills fresh, and he would keep some herbs in a dusty corner of the little corner pharmacy that he owned, not that anyone was much interested in them back in those days of Modern Medicine. He died some twenty years ago. I shudder at the knowledge that may have died with him. It should be part of the professional equipment of any pharmacist, but it no longer is.<br><br><a href=#c127014779834717778 title="comment permalink">6/25/10, 3:26 PM</a><br><br>
