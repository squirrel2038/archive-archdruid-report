Last week’s <i>Archdruid Report</i> post fielded <a href=http://scienceblogs.com/casaubonsbook/2010/02/pick_up_your_hat.php>a thoughtful response</a> from peak oil blogger Sharon Astyk, who pointed out that what I was describing as America’s descent to Third World status could as well be called a future of “ordinary human poverty.” She’s quite right, of course. There’s nothing all that remarkable about the future ahead of us; it’s simply that the unparalleled abundance that our civilization bought by burning through half a billion years of stored sunlight in three short centuries has left most people in the industrial world clueless about the basic realities of human life in more ordinary times.<br><br>It’s this cluelessness that underlies so many enthusiastic discussions of a green future full of high technology and relative material abundance. Those discussions also rely on one of the dogmas of the modern religion of progress, the article of faith that the accumulation of technical knowledge was what gave the industrial world its three centuries of unparalleled wealth; since technical knowledge is still accumulating, the belief goes, we may expect more of the same in the future. Now in fact the primary factor that drove the rise of industrial civilization, and made possible the lavish lifestyles of the recent past, was the recklessness with which the earth’s fossil fuel reserves have been extracted and burnt over the last few centuries. The explosion of technical knowledge was a consequence of that, not a cause.<br><br>In what we might as well get used to calling the real world – that is, the world as it is when human societies don’t have such immense quantities of highly concentrated energy ready to hand that figuring out how to use it all becomes a major driver of economic change – the primary constraints on the production of wealth are hard natural limits on the annual production of energy resources and raw materials. Even after two billion years of evolutionary improvements, photosynthesis only converts about one percent of the solar energy falling on leaves into chemical energy that can be used for other purposes, and that only when other requirements – water, soil nutrients, and so on – are also on hand. Other than a little extra from wind and running water, that trickle of energy from photosynthesis is what a nonindustrial society has to work with; that’s what fuels the sum total of human and animal muscle that works the fields, digs the mines, wields the tools of every craft, and does everything else that produces wealth. This, in turn, is why most people in nonindustrial societies have so little; the available energy supply, and the other resources that can be extracted and used with that energy, are too limited to provide any more.<br><br>The same sort of limits apply to the contemporary Third World, though for different reasons. Here the problem is the assortment of colonial and neocolonial arrangements that drain most of the world’s wealth into the coffers of a handful of industrial nations, and leave the rest to tussle over the little that’s left. I’ve commented here before that the five percent of the world’s population that happens to live in the United States, for example, doesn’t get to use roughly a third of the world’s resources and industrial production because the rest of the world has no desire to use a fairer share themselves. Rather, our prosperity is maintained at their expense, and until recently – when the current imperial system began coming apart at the seams – any Third World country that objected too strenuously to that state of affairs could pretty much count on having its attitude adjusted by way of a coup d’etat or "color revolution" stage-managed by one or more of the powers of the industrial world, if not an old-fashioned invasion of the sort derided in Tom Lehrer’s ballad "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93n-EmGknEU">Send the Marines</a>."<br><br>One consequence of all this is that over the last century or so, a handful of insightful thinkers have tried to explore ways in which the cycle of exploitation and dependency can be broken. One of those was the maverick economist E.F. Schumacher, whose ideas have been central to quite a few of the posts here over the last year or so. <br><br>Though he had degrees from Oxford and taught for a while at Columbia University, Schumacher was not primarily an academic; he was the polar opposite of those ivory-tower economists who have done so much damage to the world in recent decades by insisting that their theories are the key to prosperity even when the facts argue forcefully for the opposite case. He spent most of his career working in the places where government and business overlap, helping to rebuild the German economy after the Second World War and then, for two decades, serving as chief economist for the British National Coal Board, at that time one of the world’s largest energy corporations. This was the background he brought to bear on the problems facing the Third World. Still, he drew some of his central ideas from a very different source: the largely neglected economic ideas of Gandhi.<br><br>(May I interrupt this post to address a pet peeve? The family name of the founder of modern India is spelled "Gandhi," not "Ghandi." It’s not that difficult to spell it right, any more than it’s hard to avoid writing "Abraham Lcinoln," say, or "Nelson Mdanela;" despite which, I recently got sent a review copy of a book referencing Gandhi – I won’t mention the publishers, to spare them the embarrassment – which misspelled the name on the top of every single page. If you need a mnemonic, just remember that the beginning of his name is spelled like "Gandalf," not like "ghastly." Thank you, and we now return you to your regularly scheduled <i>Archdruid Report</i>.)<br><br>A lot of Americans – even, ahem, those who can spell his name correctly – think of Mohandas K. Gandhi as a spiritual leader, which of course he was, and as a political figure, which of course he also was. It’s not as often remembered that he also spent quite a bit of time developing an economic theory appropriate to the challenges facing a newly independent India. His suggestion, to condense some very subtle thinking into too few words, was that a nation that had a vast labor force but very little money was wasting its time to invest that money in state-of-the-art industrial plants; instead, he suggested, the most effective approach was to equip that vast labor force with tools that would improve their productivity within the existing structures of resource supply, production and distribution. Instead of replacing India’s huge home-based spinning and weaving industries with factories, for example, and throwing millions of spinners and weavers out of work, he argued that the most effective use of India’s limited resources was to help those spinners and weavers upgrade their skills, spinning wheels, and looms, so they could produce more cloth at a lower price, continue to support themselves by their labor, and in the process make India self-sufficient in clothing production.<br><br>This sort of thinking flies in the face of nearly every mainstream economic theory since Adam Smith, granted. Since nearly every mainstream economic theory since Adam Smith has played a sizable role in landing the industrial world in its current mess, though, I’m not so sure this is a bad thing. Current economics dismisses Gandhi’s ideas on the grounds of their "inefficiency," but this has to be taken in context, "efficiency," in today’s economic jargon, means nothing more or less than efficiency in producing somebody a profit. As a way of keeping millions of people gainfully employed, stabilizing the economy of a desperately poor nation, and preventing its wealth from being siphoned overseas by predatory industrial nations, Gandhi’s proposal is arguably very efficient indeed – and this, in turn, was what brought it to the attention of E.F. Schumacher.<br><br>One of Schumacher’s particular talents was a gift for intellectual synthesis; his work is full of cogent insights that sum up a great deal of more specialized work and make it applicable to a wider range of circumstances. This is more or less what he did with Gandhi’s ideas. Schumacher argued that talk about "developing" the Third World typically neglected to deal with one of the most pragmatic issues of all – the cost of setting up workers with the tools they needed to work.<br><br>Take a moment to follow the logic. You are the president of the newly independent Republic of Imaginaria. You’ve got a population that’s not particularly well fed, clothed, and housed, and a fairly high unemployment rate; you’ve got a very modest budget for economic development; you’ve also got raw materials of various kinds, which could be used to feed, clothe, and house the Imaginarian people. Your foreign economic advisers, who not coincidentally come from the industrial nation that used to be your country’s imperial overlord, insist that your best option is to use your budget to build a big modern factory that will turn those raw materials into goods for export to their country by their merchants, giving your country cash income to buy goods from them, and in the process employ a few thousand Imaginarians as factory workers.<br><br>Not so fast, says Schumacher. If your goal is to feed, clothe, house, and employ the Imaginarian people, building a factory is a very inefficient way to go about it, because that approach requires a very large investment per worker employed. You can provide many more Imaginarians with productive jobs for the same amount of money, by turning to a technology that’s less expensive to build, maintain, and supply with energy and raw materials – say, by providing them with hand tools and workbenches instead of state-of-the-art fabrication equipment, and setting up supply chains that supply them with local raw materials instead of imports from abroad. The goods those workers produce may not be as valuable in the export market as what might come out of a factory, but that’s not necessarily a problem – remember, your main goal is to feed, clothe, and house Imaginarians, so maximizing production for domestic use is a better idea in the first place, since less of the value produced by those workers will be skimmed off by the middlemen who manage international trade. Furthermore, since you won’t have to to trade with overseas producers for as many of the necessities of life, your need for cash from overseas goes down, and you get an economy less vulnerable to foreign-exchange shocks into the bargain.<br><br>This was the basis for what Schumacher called "intermediate technology," and the younger generation of activist-inventors who followed in his footsteps called "appropriate technology." The idea was that relatively simple technologies, powered by locally available energy sources and drawing on locally available raw materials, could provide paying jobs and an improved standard of living for working people throughout the Third World. A lot of very productive thinking went into these projects, and there were some impressive success stories before the counterrevolution of the 1980s cut what little funding the movement had been able to find. Mind you, Schumacher’s thinking was never popular among economists or the business world, and it happened more than once that countries that tried to adopt such economic policies were treated to the sort of attitude adjustments mentioned above. Still, pay attention to those Third World nations that have succeeded in becoming relatively prosperous, and you’ll find that some version of Schumacher’s scheme played a significant role in helping them do that.<br><br>It’s when the same logic is applied to the industrial world, though, that Schumacher’s ideas become relevant to the project of this blog. If, as I’ve suggested, the United States (and, in due time, the rest of the world’s industrial nations) have begun a descent to Third World status, thinking designed for the Third World may be a good deal more applicable here and now than the conventional wisdom might suggest. It seems utterly improbable to me that the governments of today’s industrial powers will have the foresight, or for that matter the common sense, to realize that economic policies that deliberately increase the number of people earning a living might be a very good idea in an age of pervasive structural unemployment – or, for that matter, to glimpse the unraveling of the industrial age, and realize that within a finite amount of time, the choice will no longer be between high-tech and low-tech ways of manufacturing goods, but between low-tech ways and no way at all. Still, national governments are not the only players in the game. <br><br>What Schumacher proposed, in fact, is one of the missing pieces to the puzzle of economic relocalization. The economies of scale that made centralized mass production possible in recent decades were simply one more side effect of the vast amount of energy the industrial nations used up during that time. As fossil fuel depletion brings those excesses to an end, the energy and other resources needed to maintain centralized mass production will no longer be available, and what I’ve described above as the economics of the real world come into play. At that point, the question of how much it costs to equip a worker to do any given job becomes a central economic issue, because any resources that have to go to equipping that worker must be taken away from another productive use.<br><br>Now of course it’s true that the cost of equipping somebody to perform some economic function locally has already entered the relocalization movement in an informal way. What Rob Hopkins calls "the great reskilling" – the process by which individuals who have no productive skills outside a centralized industrial economy learn how to make and do things on their own – has had to take place within the tolerably strict constraints of what individuals can afford to buy in the way of tools and workspaces, since there isn’t exactly a torrent of grant money available for people who want to become blacksmiths, brewers, boatbuilders, or practitioners of other useful crafts.<br><br>It may be worth suggesting, though, that Schumacher’s logic might be worth applying directly to the relocalization project by those individuals and communities who are willing to put that project into practice. The less it costs in terms of energy and other resources to prepare a community to deal with one or more of its economic needs, after all, the more will be available for other projects. Equally, the more good ideas that can be garnered from the dusty pages of publications issued by Schumacher’s Intermediate Technology Development Group and its many equivalents, and put to work during the industrial world’s decline to Third World status, the more creativity can be spared for other challenges.<br><br>Yet there’s also a broader context here, which Schumacher addressed only indirectly, and which has only been hinted at in this post – the need to redefine our notions of economics to make sense in the real world, and above all, to respond to the most economically important of the laws of physics. Yes, those would be the laws of thermodynamics. We’ll talk more about this in next week’s post.

(As soon as you mentioned Gandhi, I thought of his reviving the low-tech Indian salt “industry”.) This topic is something I’ve been thinking about more and more, as I see the word “efficient” stretched to cover the most amazing wastes of energy and people! All in pursuit of giving the middlemen an increasing cut. As someone who has settled somewhere within local reach of meat, vegetables and some grains, I feel some of my anxiety lessen, but it has been an interesting mental exercise to list those things I’d be without fairly quickly, in case of descent into regionalism (at best).<br><br>My thinking has led me to wonder about the non-local variables. Concretely: the chances of my growing coffee beans in rainy western Oregon are about nil. Ditto the chances of orange trees, although rice paddies might be managed. ;-) When I watch the angry Tea Partiers, one of my first thoughts is, “And how will the Republic of Idaho get a good deal on steel, for example?” So – one of the cold, hard facts is that the adjustment (at least in the US) will be rough. I mean, how many sitcoms can California reasonably trade for cocoa? <br><br>And what about medicines? So many of them are made in China, these days (so I hear) out of chemicals (with proprietary formulas) that I wonder if those with a variety of chronic illnesses will be “first to go”… and that could be a tragic loss for everyone. I haven’t been following Transition towns, though I’ve heard of them, and I wonder what plans they made about that – or is it assumed that only the healthiest will live? Having small drug factories in each region doesn’t seem to be efficient.<br><br>My point is, it seems to me that the United States was formed by people who recognized that the biggest hand got the biggest handout, so to speak. At least, they quickly realized that negotiating as a nation got them a better deal than individually as states. And the interstate highway system is much more efficient than a series of negotiated roads that meet at state borders. What seems to have happened is that the trade-off (no pun intended) between local and long distance got seriously out of balance, AND the middlemen got seriously greedy. Rather than crash-and-burn (and then start the cycle of banding together all over again), I hope we can find a way to look at what efficiency really is (and I love your example/description of providing for the population rather than the middlemen!) And yet, since the exploiters aren’t going to give in easily, it might come to crash-and-burn…in any case, I’m getting a lot out of the posts, and the comments!<br><br><a href=why-factories-arent-efficient.html#c1689712526181976206 title="comment permalink">2/17/10, 6:28 PM</a><br><br>

A while ago I moved to a small town of a few thousand people in the middle of farm country, IL. As it's my first house (I'm approaching middle-age, and finally can have a garden and some hens), I looked forward to converting a shed in the backyard into a small chicken coop -- just 3 or 4 hens was all I'd need. But I was stunned to find that owning hens is illegal in this town! I wonder how many towns have stupid laws like this. I'm debating whether to ignore it and get a couple anyway.....there's a huge hog operation 5 miles away that pollutes land and air - as we all know when the wind blows to our disadvantage -- but I can't have 4 chickens?<br><br><a href=why-factories-arent-efficient.html#c6874675265676201199 title="comment permalink">2/17/10, 7:09 PM</a><br><br>

In Systems theory parlance, you would probably call this a proposal to change the weights on our collective national objective function, which is currently set to a 100% weighting on short term ( &lt; 1 year ) paper profit maximization. <br><br>I would also really appreciate your wisdom on my present situation. I'm a 25 year old kid who fell hook line and sinker for the status quo until 3 years ago. Went to Wharton, did the biz thing, ended up at a hedge fund. After waking up, I relocated myself to a farm just north of Frederick MD where I'm renting. I'm working part time on an organic farm while continuing to work at the fund.

Sometimes we talk about materials, not just for cost saving but to build a green story around a product. In the terms you define you are correct factories are not efficient, they aren't always the best solution but in some limited situation factories are the only solution. No one can tinker a netbook in their garage, no one would want to dope silicon in their back room, no one can forge an ipad. Maybe not bad things in some peoples views but something we need to think about and address,.<br>One interesting point in modern factories especially in low to medium volume is they increasingly, employ cell production where one person produces the product (in the scope of the factory) from start until end. Usually we realize better "efficiency" in terms of labour hours per product, lower defect rates and better space usage.<br>Cell work is the closest we get in modern industrial production to the individual in their work room and when done well it is quite empowering. The down side is it can be isolating and is difficult for a lot of workers to adapt to and this is a problem we try to mitigate in good design but isn't always successful. <br>The challenges then are where do the difficult components come from and how do you trade for them or do without them. How do you build a community of suppliers who will not immediately start undercutting each other to make more profit and start the whole mess off again. I guess guilds was the previous model but would be illegal now. So how to you bring back something that seems to be anticompetitive.<br>Apologies for the rather rambling comment and thanks for the post.<br><br><a href=why-factories-arent-efficient.html#c8000625073167070626 title="comment permalink">2/17/10, 8:55 PM</a><br><br>

As I was reading this post, I kept thinking how scalable the theory is. What is true of Imaginaria is just as true of a single household. If a family produces all their own food, clothing, water, fuel, shelter, medicine, and entertainment, they have much less need for money. Just as a self-sufficient nation is less apt to be rocked by instability in foreign markets, a self-sufficient home is less apt to be threatened by a rise in unemployment.<br><br>My wife and I were discussing what seems at first blush to be evidence to refute this idea--artisans producing high-priced items to sell for cash in order to buy low-priced equivalents. For example, I raise chickens and grow vegetables, sell them for premium prices, and then buy cheaper food at the grocery store, food that can be offered more cheaply because of economies of scale, industrial production, and centralized distribution. If we just ate the food I produce and didn't "export" any of it out of our household, we would be poorer.<br><br>Thinking upon it, though, we realized that the food I'm selling is much higher quality than the food we're buying. We're cashing in on the difference to make up for resources we have to "import" like utilities and fuel. If a nation's principle product is jacuzzis, I don't think either Gandhi or Schumacher would suggest that the best survival strategy for that nation's people would be to use the jacuzzis instead of selling them to buy food!<br><br>The key to self-sufficiency, then, is to make sure one <i>has</i> as many as possible of the resources one needs (whether one is a nation, a company, or a single person). There's the rub. Most people--and some nations--don't have all the resources they need to be completely independent, so they have to trade surpluses of what they do have. India's surplus was labor. :)<br><br>As for reskilling and retooling, I've found, as I look for cheap, low-tech implements for micro-farming, that a lot of really cool things have been developed that just aren't available in the US or Canada. A lot of mills, pumps, irrigation tape, rechargeable lights, hand tools, etc., that I've found online are only available on other continents, despite having been invented by Americans. I wonder if that will change as the developers become aware of a growing interest in their products here.<br><br>I've also been looking forward to the next installment of Star's Reach.<br><br><a href=why-factories-arent-efficient.html#c3811135991711057131 title="comment permalink">2/17/10, 10:49 PM</a><br><br>

He didn't even like the title of Mahatma that was bestowed upon him. The self sufficiency and compassionate approach to life that he practiced and preached is a far cry from the weaving factories and brand name desires of many modern Indians and police who still use their bamboo sticks to teach lessons to the poor in view of everyone. People look to him and say, we need someone like you to help us, all over the world they say this (and he was in favour of gurus) but not of your guru thinking and acting for you. His was a message of change yourself, and then participate cooperatively in restructuring your communities and shunning those institutions who would seek to exploit. I wonder if Coca-Cola would have managed to last this long if he were still kicking. Luckily though India does have a long history of revolutionary spirituality and subsistence to fall back on and with modern thinkers like Vandana Shiva they will likely weather the coming storm with far less turbulence than the people of luxurious western nations.<br><br><a href=why-factories-arent-efficient.html#c2558590423100937946 title="comment permalink">2/17/10, 10:50 PM</a><br><br>

Thanks for the great post.<br><br>It seems like the core idea behind Schumacher's economic theory is that we all have a useful skill and/or trade. It is a bit of a reflection of nature in that not working = not eating. In terms of resilience learning a useful and tradeable skill may well be seen as a survival skill in a more regionalised future. In Australia, not 150 years ago armed bush rangers roamed the country side in either gangs or as individuals at will taking basically what they wanted. It's not that long ago and as a general rule they were blood thirsty psychopaths. As an individual or community though if you have tradeable skills then your usefulness may outweigh your value as cannon fodder. It's a case of mutually assured destruction. <br><br>Good skills to learn include: forestry operations, fruit growing, vegetable growing, carpentry, smithing... The list is endless. It may also be important to obtain good quality basic tools (and tools to maintain those) in the near future whilst they are readily available. Even more important is to learn how to use them properly. In convict times, because of the long supply lines between the UK and Australia tools had a value higher than that of human life and convicts received very serious punishments for breaking them.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><a href=why-factories-arent-efficient.html#c5342452850120312091 title="comment permalink">2/17/10, 11:50 PM</a><br><br>

This concept of spreading the wealth and distribution to the people is completely absent in the manufacturing sector in the West. <br> <br>While I regularly read the Oil Drum, I find it fascinating that trying to mention ideas such as this find absolutely no fertile ground in the comments.

You are a particular standout in the 'new' strain of thought (someone needs to coin a name/phrase for it, something beyond just 'peak oil thinkers,' as it goes way, way past that) that includes the likes of Kunstler, Astyk, Hopkins, Holmgren, etc.<br><br>A timely post for me- since the NYC library apparently has lost the last remaining copy of "Small is Beautiful" in their collection (which strikes me as bizarre), I broke down and ordered it. But in the meantime I'm reading Hazlitt's "Economics in One Lesson," largely because something about the economics of Hayek, Hazlitt, von Mises, et al in particular, but mainstream economic thought in general intuitively seems fatally flawed to me, and your writing in particular greatly aids me in picking through their seemingly strong logic.<br><br>Recently the C-Realm podcast (on which I believe you've been a guest in the past) had economist Frank Rotering as a guest; he is the author of a recent book, available online as a .pdf called "Needs and Limits- A New Economics for Sustainable Well-being." I have not dug into it deeply, but your take on his economic ideas would be interesting.<br><br>You began your post talking about available sustainable energy essentially being limited by photosynthesis (and the efficiency or such, or lack-thereof if judged from the modern, techno-human perspective). I've long admired the work of Howard Odum, and believe the only sustainable economy and/or monetary system must be one that is directly pegged to the energy we receive from the sun- all things must be valued according to a strict energy accounting based on that sustainable energy rate. But how do you respond to those proposing that nuclear power (which our great leader seems to be increasingly supportive of) changes everything? Beyond arguing that nuclear power is very much like fossil fuel in that it relies on feedstock that is limited, and that by most measures, at least now, there is little net energy gain (when all is taken into account) many remain unconvinced. Perhaps you've written on this in past posts and I've missed them.<br><br>Finally- I just finished 'The Econtechnic Future'- great stuff.

I'm not at all sure George Washington would want to be remembered as a founding father of what the US has become, either.<br><br>Cherokee, good. In the pirate havens of the Caribbean -- arguably some of history's most lawless societies -- physicians, shipwrights, and other skilled tradespeople led charmed lives, because everybody knew their own lives might depend on having those people alive and functioning. <br><br>Sam, it's an interesting question, but I'd point out that similar periods of scientific advance had occurred elsewhere -- in Classical times, for example, and in imperial China -- and did not lead to the same result. I'd argue that fossil fuels, and only fossil fuels, made the extravagances of the last three hundred years possible. <br><br>Yossarian, you're welcome! <i>Small is Beautiful</i> is one of the few books I'd recommend that everybody in the peak oil scene read, and then think about, and then read again. <br><br>Jean-Vivien, in rather less than a century, "health care" will consist of what you can do for yourself and your family, supplemented by folk treatments from the odd old woman who lives down the lane and whose grandmother used to be a registered nurse. Yes, that means a lot of people will die sooner than they otherwise would. <br><br>Tiago, excellent! Of course we could employ everybody by working less and spreading jobs more widely, or by going back to the one-income family as the norm, but try suggesting either one of those as an option. These days, unions in the US are willing to see entire factories shut down and every single worker lose his job rather than take a 5% pay cut. <br><br>Jason, not as long as all those nukes are in the way. That's one of the reasons why I expect things to head more in the direction of a color revolution, allegedly domestic, but actually funded and organized from abroad (as color revolutions generally are). <br><br>Edina, good. Dandelion's also good for your liver -- not a bad thing to have handy in the aftermath of a very toxic age. <br><br>Paul and Phyllis, I'd be happier if that wisdom were to be common among ordinary people.

"Gahstly?"<br><br>Professor, faith in progress <i>is</i> a fundamentalist religion. It's got the same blithe disregard for facts that contradict its ideology, and the same rabid fury toward those who don't believe. <br><br>Thai, that's exactly the sort of thing we need. There used to be a lot of it in the US during the appropriate tech movement of the Seventies; we need to tap back into that sort of garage-workshop spirit, and soon. <br><br>Lance, exactly. <br><br>Arabella, Buehner also has a very solid book on herbal antibiotics -- the title, not surprisingly, is <i>Herbal Antibiotics</i> -- which belongs near the top of any alternative health care bookshelf.

That's why, as I mentioned to Jean-Vivien, we can be sure that in the deindustrial future, a lot of people will die sooner than they otherwise would. One of the popular genres of early printed books in late medieval Europe were collectively known as <i>ars moriendi</i> -- "the art of dying." They were handbooks to help people work through the process of dealing with their own imminent death, and in a lot of cases, that sort of thing will be the only treatment a deindustrial medicine can offer.<br><br>As for coffee, well, just remember that anything of value you stockpile makes you a more tempting target for thieves and looters. It's what you know how to do for other people that makes you worth keeping alive and happy. <br><br>Ariel, thank you. <br><br>Unadilla, if nuclear power produced as much net energy as its proponents claim, it would be commercially viable -- and it isn't. The only nations that have been able to keep a nuclear power industry going have had to prop it up with huge government subsidies. Since what Odum called "emergy" -- embodied energy -- is a very large part of the cost of anything, price makes a functional proxy for net energy; if an energy source can't make money even when energy sells at a high price, there's something wrong with figures that claim it's a big net energy winner. <br><br>Mind you, none of that will slow down the rush to nuclear power. It's getting to the point that any scheme that promises to allow business as usual to continue, no matter how harebrained, can count on being flooded with money from our government's hyperactive printing presses. I suspect that a thousand years from now, the empty shells of half-completed nuclear power plants will dot the landscape of medieval America, and scholars will wonder what gods the ancients hoped to placate by trying to build so many temples in the days before the just wrath of Gaia destroyed them, or whatever the prevailing mythology happens to be.<br><br><a href=why-factories-arent-efficient.html#c4075236666026479457 title="comment permalink">2/18/10, 7:56 AM</a><br><br>

Here is the problem, we will be stale. Time is an issue, the point of better tools and even machines in factories to allow time for workers to specialize. Specialization increases the amount of goods they can produce without worrying about the other necessities of life. By doing everything oneself or even in a family unit this factor is greatly limited. So the poor Imaginarians stay poor. There is no growth, barring the natural human tendency to undercut others that is. Granted that it would be a Barter and Trade with fiat being wholly obsolete. So shouldn't the basis be on group economics and the idea of specialization? Regardless who's economic theory is right there very basic laws that hold absolutely true no matter what. Trade, Specialization, human nature all amount to the same thing no matter who's model you look at. There will still be haves and have nots. There will still be gluttony and greed. So please explain to me how to change human nature? You can do it for a few but the majority will not alter, even in a collapse. I dare say that will make it and depravity even worse. It is noble and the idea rings true, but it is short term at best.<br><br><a href=why-factories-arent-efficient.html#c3258277439920147667 title="comment permalink">2/18/10, 5:29 PM</a><br><br>

Just as a transitive verb must always have an object (i.e. give) efficiency should be specified as to what sort of efficiency it is. Efficiency is always a trade-off. One can often be efficient of labor, for instance, by using more fuel. One can be efficient of development time by sacrificing operating efficiency (and delivering lower quality).<br><br>In modern industry, the first priority is not mechanical, labor, fuel or other efficiency. It's efficiency of capital. What will return the most money for the money invested? All other efficiencies must come after. Whether the trade-off is in the long or short term interests of the employees, management, community, nation or even the investors is a rarely-considered afterthought. <br><br>re: chickens, anyone who wants to keep a few chickens at home needs to be aware of the NAIS National Animal Identification System, which the department of Agriculture has been trying to implement for the last several years. It will create huge burdens for the keeping of small numbers of livestock. NAIS was developed by the slaughterhouse industry and the agri-industrial conglomerates like Magill, ADM and Con-Agra to drive the small producer out of business, with onerous requirements for tagging, registration and record-keeping for all livestock., except for producers with over several hundred head.<br><br><a href=why-factories-arent-efficient.html#c6938149712279636345 title="comment permalink">2/18/10, 5:50 PM</a><br><br>

The USDA subsidizes the production of corn and other commodities (like soybeans and wheat). They do not, however, subsidize what they call "specialty crops," that is, fruits and vegetables. (Pollan covered this in <i>The Omnivore's Dilemma</i>.)<br><br>A more telling comparison would be of my chicken versus chicken by Tyson, Perdue, or one of those other big boys. Like them, I benefit from agricultural subsidies in that I can buy corn cheaper than I could grow it myself. But since I don't have space to store entire truckloads of it, nor the capital to buy that much at once, nor the bargaining power to get bulk discounts, I pay by the 50-pound bag, increasing my cost of production.<br><br>My equipment costs are actually much lower, but I give my birds enough space that they don't require antibiotics. A conventional broiler house can hold thousands of chickens; mine hold no more than 100 apiece. A conventional chicken farmer might raise hundreds of thousands of birds a year just to make about $16,000. I make about half that raising less than a thousand chickens. Big producers can accept a lower price per chicken because they have so many more of them. <br><br>Lest I seem like I'm giving the industrial food system a pat on the back, let's acknowledge the monumental damage they've done to the environment, their exploitation of immigrant labor, and so on. The sticker in the grocery store doesn't reflect all the costs the producers externalize. But when it comes to simple price wars, the factory farms have me beat.<br><br><a href=why-factories-arent-efficient.html#c6863817463207237691 title="comment permalink">2/18/10, 7:31 PM</a><br><br>

I especially liked Hagbard’s Law, no, I didn’t like it, I loved it.<br><br>Now, thank heavens, I finally have something to quibble over. I refer to:<br><br>“…Now in fact the primary factor that drove the rise of industrial civilization, and made possible the lavish lifestyles of the recent past, was the recklessness with which the earth’s fossil fuel reserves have been extracted and burnt over the last few centuries. The explosion of technical knowledge was a consequence of that, not a cause.”<br><br>You are right about the role of fossil fuel in allowing the recent lavish lifestyles, but wrong about the explosion of technical knowledge also being entirely a consequence of the exploitation of fossil fuels. Well… your are partially wrong, the story is much, much more complex.<br><br>After all, various previous civilizations were well aware of most of the fossil fuels we use and in fact used them extensively to, for instance, water proof and preserve ships, but they did not use them to any great extent as fuels. This was because their technology did not allow them to:<br>1. Easily obtain the fossil fuels in large quantities.<br>2. Refine them into safe, useful products such as coke and kerosene.<br>3. Cheaply transport them in huge quantities the large distances from where they were available to where they were needed.<br><br>Now, at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, both technical and scientific knowledge was already growing at an increasing rate and had been for a long time without any help from fossil fuels. What then happened was that a critical mass was reached were fossil fuels were able to be mined cheaply in huge quantities, refined into an increasing array of increasingly useful products and transported longer and longer distances more and more cheaply.<br><br>This immediately lead to feedback loops between technology/science and fossil fuels as the very availability of cheap fossil fuels made whole new technologies possible such as the steam engine, or made things like iron cheaper allowing railroads which then caused a feedback that made fossil fuels even cheaper and caused even more effort to be devoted to technology and science devoted to making them yet cheaper again, as well as finding many more uses for fossil fuels.<br><br>This spawned a bewilderingly complex, interwoven, three dimensional structure of feedback loops between technology/science, fossil fuels and increasingly economics, finance and politics.<br><br>Now, this structure is enormously tough, resilient and adaptable, which is probably what leads some people to mistakenly assume Peak Everything is a non-event as the structure will just adapt. Well, yes, it probably will, but this adaptation may well take the form of reducing the Earth’s present population of 6.5 billion + to, say, half a billion.<br><br>This is of course where you and I disagree as I think science and technology will come through whatever is coming just fine, it’s the humans (and nature) who may find the process of adaptation to the new circumstances a bit harsh. Nevertheless, I expect that the people who live, say, 300 years in the future will wonder what all the fuss was about and enjoy quite pleasant lives – all 250 – 500 million of them.<br><br>That is, of course, unless the Over Unity, Vacuum Energy guys actually produce something. In that case it’s a wild ride to the stars.<br><br>Stephen Heyer<br><br><a href=why-factories-arent-efficient.html#c3323615260884241664 title="comment permalink">2/19/10, 4:21 AM</a><br><br>

That’s why I recommend skipping Practical Action’s homepage. Beneath a lot of glitzy marketing, it makes them appear like just another charity. They describe their mission as eliminating poverty. There are photos of destitute people. To most of us rich First Worlders (even eco-yuppies), that’s anathema. Taking advice from them would feel like signing up for welfare, wouldn’t it?<br><br>Even in the transition towns and eco-villages I’ve seen, these “Practical Answers” are only for people in some slum on the other side of the world. It makes me wonder, would Rob Hopkins be humble enough to take advice from Practical Action? Are we humble enough to really and truly apply technologies that were heretofore only for the extremely destitute? Or will we be revolted and say “Ick!” ?

My grandparents -- my father's mother and step-father -- at one point in their lives worked for a crook. That was back in the 1910s and '20s. Some years before that, grandpa had been a carney, and he knew a great deal about how to con the marks and other such things. I learned a lot from them both about surviving under very adverse social conditions<br><br>Part of the trick to keeping your house safe from burglars and your stockpile of goods safe from thieves is to position yourself strategically along the gradients of wealth and security in your immediate neighborhood. You must seem less wealthy than at least half of your neighbors. At the same time you must seem harder to rob than at least half of your neighbors. That way the greedy will rob others before you, and the lazy will also rob others before you. The family in the middle of both these gradients is usually one of the last to be robbed. Eventually the robbers may get closer to you, when easier or richer pickings become slim. That is when you move to a new neighborhood and reposition yourself appropriately in its gradients.<br><br>Of course this won't keep you safe forever in a time of general collapse. But it's a start and may help until you can get a handle on the new order of things.<br><br>Also, the advice in JMG's last sentence quoted above is solid gold. It was what kept these grandparents of mine afloat in very rough times.

As these are typically stated as % increases in productivity, you have a compound-interest sort of function that - if you plotted "widgets produced per unit labor-hour invested" on a linear graph, you'd see an exponentially rising curve. The consequence of this is, over many decades, order-of-magnitude increases in competitive industries' ability to crank out products of all sorts, per unit of labor put in.<br><br>Even in agriculture, the same productivity improvements have been a regular occurrence, to the point where the occupation "farmer" now applies to something less than 2% of the U.S. population, where not so long ago it was over 50%. This means that 2% of our population is now employed producing that basic necessity - food - for themselves and the other 98%. (Of course fossil fuel as the exosomatic source of energy is primarily what made this possible, and the numbers would look far different if we measured productivity, or "efficiency", as product_out vs. energy_in, or as product_out vs. capital_investment or material_feedstock in; but, back to the point:)<br><br>Now what happens as a one-time industrial powerhouse like the U.S. slides relentlessly into Third-World status that you suggest is our destination? Clearly, one attribute of that status is that households acquire a whole lot less *stuff* than they and their parents did in the past. The luxury items go first, then the 'nice to have', and then the things that we presently consider necessities, like gasoline-powered vehicles for commuting to work. One can imagine that conventionally-measured GDP could decline by 50% to 80% or more and we'd still have a functioning civilization and economy of some sort as we stagger down to Third-World levels.<br><br>(sending this in 2 parts; part 2 below) - Dick Lawrence<br><br><a href=why-factories-arent-efficient.html#c6216423743450104967 title="comment permalink">2/19/10, 8:25 PM</a><br><br>

In order to sustain the magical level of "full employment" - unemployment being perhaps on the order of 5% or less, as measured today - that means households would have to keep buying all that *stuff*. When they cease such consumerist behavior, and cut back radically on purchases of everything beyond what's required for basic survival (food, clothing, shelter, a bicycle), there will be no demand for all that *stuff*, companies that made it will collapse and go Chapter 11, and their employees will be on the street and applying for nonexistent unemployment compensation. <br><br>Agile companies might rapidly restructure, change their product lineup to make "essential" stuff, but how many people might that realistically employ? How many companies are really required? If the example of farming is any indication, we could probably supply a country like the U.S. with the basic essentials for 3rd-world standards of living employing perhaps 10% of the working population. That would mean the other 90% is unemployed - basically redundant (perhaps viewed as parasitic) consumers of whatever is required to survive. Without a vast new form of social safety net it's hard to see any good coming from such an arrangement.<br><br>As you, Schumacher, and M.Gandhi point out, the better solution is to run that "productivity paradigm" in reverse, and doing it in a planned way would be far better than letting collapse take its course. Naturally, availability of energy supply is partly what mandates a form of the solution: "productivity" as conventionally measured must go down, as energy costs go up. Human hours to produce essential widgets will rise, and therefore the number of people potentially employed will rise.

Great news! That does not mean that industrial agriculture is not working hard to ruin small organic farmer's attempts to cut out the middleman while producing better, safer food. There now appears to be an increased assault on direct sales of raw milk. For example, the Department of Public Health in Massachusetts recently issued 'cease and desist' orders to buying clubs who were driving many miles to pick up milk at farms in Western Massachusetts. It is legal to buy raw milk from licensed facilities in Massachusetts but you have to go pick it up. Apparently, each milk drinker must get in his personal vehicle and drive 70 miles from the city to the farm! It appears that the buying clubs were finding members on the internet. This means that there are government officials searching the web for successful models of small scale agriculture and targeting them. My guess it that the Massachusetts Department of Public Health employees actually believe they are protecting the public! It is important to have national organizations, linked on the web while we have it, to fight big agriculture's attacks on small farms. I have joined the "Farm to Consumer Legal Defense Fund" and find their web site very enlightening.

We can dismiss fusion, as the 'boffins' have been working on it for 50 years and are still need to 'turn the corner' on extracting any useful energy from it. If it happens, it won't be soon enough to stave off collapse. The hypothetical 'zero point' energy would fall in the same category. <br><br>Fission energy is well known technology, and occasionally makes the news when there's a big event like Three Mile Island or Chernobyl. Note that both these sites are still closed, have not been cleaned up, and are still dangerous to any nearby life forms. <br><br>Fission energy is probably the best poster child for the story of profligacies of scale. You'll probably never drive a fission powered car, or have a small fission unit in your garage. It only makes sense to employ fission in a gigantic multimegawatt generating station. <br><br>When you look at the physics of it, fission looks like a wonderful energy source - proponents are fond of quoting a statistic about the thousands of times more energy you get from a nuclear reaction than from a chemical one. And this is true; the sticky issue is in the side effects, and byproducts, and in the sheer scale of the thing. <br><br>Here's how I'd approach describing this scale: how much do you know about what happened five thousand years ago? Where are the records? What language were they written in? What materials were stored in containers from that era, and in what condition are the containers? <br><br>Continuing with a thought experiment, suppose we pursue this technofix and build a fleet of reactors burning thorium (many nuke engineers believe this is feasible and thorium is a bit more abundant than silver in the earth's crust). And we build all these reactors and attempt to continue our expanding energy usage. Hypothetically we could do this for another century or so. <br><br>As the reactors are shut down and decommissioned, the remains of their thorium fuel will be in the form of a random assortment of middle-weight elements, in a random assortment of isotopes. Many of them have half-lives in the thousands of years. <br><br>And now that the party's over, there isn't any dumpster big enough to contain the trash. There isn't any such thing as 'away'. That's the downside of nuclear energy.<br><br><a href=why-factories-arent-efficient.html#c7263955501057036824 title="comment permalink">2/21/10, 11:19 AM</a><br><br>

We are all passengers on the Titanic, after it has hit the iceberg and are now watching the last life boat row away.<br><br>Please forgive the gallows humor some of us profess as the water laps at our shoes.<br><br>My father died last year to the horrors of being warehoused due to Alzheimer's. I watched a strong carrying man become a scare paranoid shell over the course of several years, before being medicated into zombiehood to better handle his condition. Or make that, handle it with the least labor for the nursing home he was in.<br><br>The family had tried to keep him at home and allow him some measure of dignity in his death. It was just too much to keep up the care on a day to day basis. I can not imagine what a similar situation will be like 20 years from now.<br><br>I can only hope that when my feet are in that shoes, my family has the courage to put a pillow over my face and hold it tight.<br><br>Sorry, was that too real for the discussion here?<br><br><a href=why-factories-arent-efficient.html#c4141042185875855060 title="comment permalink">2/22/10, 8:54 PM</a><br><br>

They are created by the agribusiness interests, drafted by their lobbyists, and passed as law by "our" representatives, specifically to increaase their market share by discouraging all others.<br><br>Public Health officials are not independent government protectors of our health, but collude with the most toxic and unhealthy food producers in history to protect their profits. I would argue that the FDA itself is a threat to public health, populated with revolving-door bureaucrats taking their last few spins on the private/public sector merry-go-round.<br><br>Perhaps you imagine milk producers continuing to pool their products for sale to the millions of masses now served by the billion-carton. But the small producers simply want to stay in business, which they can more likely do now by selling locally, in which case contamination is much easier to track than the vast networks of FoodInc.<br><br>So of course it's reasonable to expect them to want to limit the sales of raw milk: just not for the cause of your health or mine.<br><br>Pretty soon it will no longer be a tiny minority served by the small producer, but everyone who wants to eat. The tide is rising for the Middle Man, along with the whole poisonous circus of suits who enrich themselves by impoverishing the soil.<br><br>The regulation I want to see honored is the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, the Right To Contract. I want to grow whatever I want, and give, trade or sell it to whoever trusts me enough to engage a deal.

I've been reading all your posts and just wanted to make a comment about what is necessary for human life. A few years ago I hiked the entire Appalachian Trail. This was a great learning experience about what is needed to survive. First and most important: Potable Water. That means drinkable. (Of course I'm very concerned about the really terrible state of our water today...) Second: Food. Obviously this will take some effort to feed everyone without fossil fuels. Third: Shelter. It gets cold out there and the last thing you want to do is be wet and cold. You can live without heating your home (except for the pipes), but you will want to have some good down comforters. Fourth: Health. I mean this in a broad context that includes hygiene. We have allowed our health system to be based plastic surgery and having old folks on 8 or 10 different pills at the same time. We need to get back to the basics: Preventative medicine and hygiene. Everything else is just "fluff". That BMW is not a necessity. This computer I type at is not a necessity. I will argue that some form of entertainment, arts, sports, etc. would fall in fifth place, but I find that if you put 5 people around a dinner table with no distractions they will start talking to each other and entertain themselves just fine.<br><br>Thanks for the great blog.<br><br><a href=why-factories-arent-efficient.html#c8869680494731191820 title="comment permalink">3/15/10, 8:56 PM</a><br><br>

The Barbary "Halls of Tripoli" pirates of the past. The slave trade of long ago and the continuing trade today. Think communist revolutions, think World Wars. Cheap communications, including universal mail service, phone connections - these aren't luxuries, they are ways to prevent tyrants and the ambitious from dividing and conquering in communications isolation.<br><br>Any loss in communication will inspire increases in aggression. <br><br>Your sojourn on the Appalachian trail was not done in isolation. You traveled alone, out of communications contact - with a nation keeping a moderate watch on the security of those on the trail. Those places where travelers touch down with community - would notice a sudden dearth of travelers. You might not have carried a cell phone or radio for requesting assistance, but I would presume some of your fellow travelers did. The Appalachian trail is a part of a national park, administrated in peace time, by a nation with armies and navies both actively and passively assuring the security of those with the inclination, to hike in solitude and reasonable security. Everyone from the President to the Supreme Court, to the degree communications exist, were involved in your safety.<br><br>Let communications deteriorate, and I expect the rise, again, of full battle engagements of armies again, of conscription and massacre by thugs and armies, of armed aggression as crops suffer setbacks, or a neighboring state gets jealous of the assets of another.<br><br>Maybe there is an equation, about concentration of aggressive force being less likely in an environment of greater communication. President Kennedy thought so, with the Red Phone.<br><br><a href=why-factories-arent-efficient.html#c924325703636245270 title="comment permalink">3/16/10, 8:21 AM</a><br><br>
