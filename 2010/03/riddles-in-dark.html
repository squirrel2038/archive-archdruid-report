Any number of metaphors might be used for the predicament today’s industrial societies face as the age of cheap energy stumbles to its end, but the one that keeps coming to mind is drawn from a scene in one of the favorite books of my childhood, J.R.R. Tolkien’s <i>The Hobbit</i>. It’s the point in the story when Bilbo Baggins, the protagonist, gets lost in goblin-tunnels under the Misty Mountains and there encounters a gaunt, slippery, cannibalistic creature named Gollum.<br><br>That meeting was not exactly full of bonhomie. Gollum regarded Bilbo in much the way a hungry undergraduate regards the arrival of takeout pizza, but Bilbo was armed and alert. To put his intended meal off his guard, Gollum challenged Bilbo to a riddle contest. So there they sat, deep underground, challenging each other with the hardest riddles they could think of. I sometimes think the rock around Gollum’s lair must have been a Jurassic sandstone full of crude oil; if Gollum were around nowadays, equally, I suspect he would be shilling for Cambridge Energy Research Associates, purveying energy misinformation to the media, and his “Preciousss” would be made of black gold. Certainly, though, the world’s industrial societies right now are in much the same predicament as Bilbo, fumbling in the dark for answers to riddles that take on an increasingly threatening tone with each moment that passes.<br><br>I’d like to talk about three of those riddles now. None of them are insoluble, but they point to a profoundly unwelcome reality that will play a major role in shaping the economics of the age dawning around us right now – and unlike characters in a children’s novel, we can’t count on being bailed out of our predicament, as Bilbo was, by the unexpected discovery of a magic ring. Here they are:<br><br>First: It is the oldest machine in the world; it has raised the world’s greatest monuments and destroyed most of them, saved lives by the millions and killed them in like number; and when it is not in use, no one can see it. What is it?<br><br>Second: There is a thoroughly proven, economically viable way to use solar energy that requires no energy subsidy from fossil fuels at all, and every mainstream economist thinks that getting rid of it wherever possible is the key to prosperity. What is it?<br><br>Third: Two workers in different countries work in identical factories, using identical tools to make identical products. One of them makes twenty dollars an hour plus a benefit package; the other makes two dollars a day with no benefits at all. Why is that?<br><br>The last one is the easiest, though you’ll have a hard time finding a single figure in American public life who will admit to the answer. It’s not considered polite these days to talk about America’s empire, despite the fact that we keep troops in 140 other countries, and the far from unrelated fact that the 5% of Earth’s population that live in the US use around a third of the world’s resources, energy, and consumer products. Like every other empire, we have a tribute economy; we dress it up in free-market drag by giving our trading partners mountains of worthless paper in return for the torrents of real wealth that flow into the US every day; but the result, now as in the past, is that the imperial nation and its inner circle of allies have a vast surplus of wealth sloshing through their economies. Handing over a little of that extra wealth to the poor and the working class has proven to be a tolerably effective way to maintain some semblance of social order.<br><br>That habit has been around nearly as long as empires themselves; the Romans were particularly adept at it -- “bread and circuses” is the famous phrase for their policy of providing free food and entertainment to the Roman urban poor o keep them docile. Starting in the wake of the last Great Depression, when many wealthy people woke up to the fact that their wealth did not protect them against bombs tossed through windows, most industrial nations have done the same thing by ratcheting up working class incomes and providing benefits such as old age pensions. No doubt a similar logic motivated the recent rush to force through a national health care system in the US, though the travesty that resulted is likely to cause far more unrest than it quells.<br><br>More generally, what passes by the name of democracy these days is a system in which factions of the political class buy votes from pressure groups by handing out what the political slang of an earlier day called by the endearing name of “pork.” The imperial tribute economy provided ample resources for political pork vendors, and the resulting outpouring of pig product formed a rising tide that, as the saying goes, lifted all boats. The problem, of course, is the same problem that afflicted Britain’s domestic economy during its age of empire, and Spain’s before that, and so on down through history: when wages in an imperial nation rise far enough above those of its neighbors, it stops being profitable to hire people in the imperial nation for any task that can be done outside it.<br><br>The result is a society in which those who get access to pork prosper, and those who don’t are left twisting in the wind. Arnold Toynbee, whose monumental study of the rise and fall of empires remains the most detailed examination of the process, calls these latter the “internal proletariat”: those who live within an imperial society but no longer share in its benefits, and become increasingly disaffected from its ideals and institutions. In the near term, they are the natural fodder of demagogues; in the longer term, they make common cause with the “external proletariat” – those nations outside the imperial borders whose labor and resources have become essential to the imperial economy, but who receive no benefits from that economy – and play a key role in bringing the whole system crashing down.<br><br>One of the ironies of the modern world is that today’s economists, so many of whom pride themselves on their realism, have by and large ignored the political dimensions of economics, and retreated into what amounts to a fantasy world in which the overwhelming influence of political considerations on economic life is denounced as an aberration where it is acknowledged at all. What Adam Smith and his successors called “political economy” suffered the amputation of its first half once Marx showed that it could be turned into an instrument for rabblerousing. Thus the economists who support the current versions of bread and circuses labor to find specious economic reasons for what, after all, is a simple political payoff. Meanwhile, those who oppose them have lost track of the very real possibility that those who are made to go hungry in the presence of abundance may embrace options entirely outside of the economic realm, such as the aforementioned bombs through windows.<br><br>This irony is compounded by the fact that very nearly every economist in the profession, liberal or conservative, accepts certain presuppositions that work overtime to speed the process by which the working class becomes an internal proletariat in Toynbee’s sense, hastening the breakdown of the society these economists claim to interpret. It takes a careful ear for the subtleties of economic jargon to understand how this works. Economists talk constantly about efficiency and productivity, but they rarely say in so many words is what these terms mean.<br><br>A glance inside any economics textbook will clue you in. By efficiency, economists mean <i>labor efficiency</i> – that is, how much or little of human labor is needed for any given economic task. By productivity, in turn, economists mean <i>labor productivity</i> – that is, how much value is created per unit of labor. Thus anything that decreases the number of employee hours needed to produce a given quantity of goods and services counts as an increase in efficiency and productivity, whether or not it is efficient or productive in any other sense.<br><br>There’s a reason for this rather odd habit, and it points up one of the central issues of the industrial world’s present predicament. In the industrial world, for the last century or more, labor costs have been the single largest expense for most business enterprises, in large part because of the upward pressure on living standards caused by the tribute economy. Meanwhile the cost of natural resources and energy have been kept down by the same imperial arrangements. The result is a close parallel to Liebig’s Law, one of the fundamental principles of ecology. Liebig’s Law holds that the nutrient in shortest supply puts a ceiling on the growth of living things, irrespective of the availability of anything more abundant; in the same way, our economics have evolved to treat the costliest resource to hand, human labor, as the main limitation to economic growth, and to treat anything that decreases the amount of labor as an economic gain.<br><br>Even when the energy needed to power machines was still cheap and abundant, this way of thinking was awash with mordant irony, because only in times of relatively robust economic growth did workers who were rendered surplus by such “productivity gains” readily find jobs elsewhere. At least as often, they added to the rolls of the unemployed, or pushed others onto those rolls, fueling the growth of an impoverished underclass that formed the seed of today’s rapidly growing internal proletariat. With the end of the age of cheap energy, though, the fixation on labor efficiency promises to become a millstone around the neck of America’s economy and, from a wider perspective, that of the world as a whole.<br><br>A world that has nearly seven billion people on it and a rapidly dwindling supply of fossil fuels, after all, has better ways to manage its affairs than those based on the assumption that putting people out of work and replacing them with fossil fuels is the way to prosperity. This is one of the unlearned lessons of the global economy that is now coming to an end around us. While it was billed by friends and foes alike as the final triumph of corporate capitalism, globalization can more usefully be understood as an attempt by a failing system to prop up the illusion of economic growth by transferring the production of goods and services to economies that are, by the standards just mentioned, less efficient than those of the industrial world. Without the distorting effects of an imperial tribute economy, labor proved to be enough cheaper than energy that the result was profitable, and allowed the world’s industrial nations to maintain their exaggerated standards of living for a few more years.<br><br>At the same time, the brief heyday of the global economy was only made possible by a glut of petroleum that made transportation costs negligible. That glut is ending as world oil production begins to slip down the far side of Hubbert’s curve, while the Third World nations that profited most by globalization cash in their newfound wealth for a larger share of the world’s energy resources, putting further pressure on a balance of power that is already tipping against the United States and its allies. As this process continues, the tribute economy will be an early casualty. The implications for the lifestyles of most Americans will not be welcome.<br><br>I have suggested in previous posts that one useful way to think about the transformations now under way is to see them as the descent of the United States to Third World status. One consequence of that process is that most Americans, in the not very distant future, will earn the equivalent of a Third World income. It’s unlikely that their incomes will actually drop to $2 a day; far more likely is that the value of the dollar will crumple, so that a family making $40,000 a year might expect to pay half that to keep itself fed on rice and beans, and the rest to buy cooking fuel and a few other necessities.<br><br>It’s hard to see any way such a decline in our collective wealth could take place without political explosions on the grand scale. Still, in the twilight of the age of cheap energy, the most abundant energy source remaining throughout the world will be human labor, and as other resources become more costly, the price of labor – and thus the wages that can be earned by it – will drop accordingly.<br><br>At the same time, human labor has certain crucial advantages in a world of energy scarcity. Unlike other ways of getting work done, which generally require highly concentrated energy sources, human labor is fueled by food, which is a form of solar energy. Our agricultural system produces food using fossil fuels, but this is a bad habit of an age of abundant energy; field labor by human beings with simple tools, paid at close to Third World wages, already plays a crucial role in the production of many crops in the US, and this will only increase as wages drop and fuel prices rise.<br><br>The agriculture of the future, like agriculture in any thickly populated society with few energy resources, will thus use land intensively rather than extensively, rely on human labor with hand tools rather than more energy-intensive methods, and produce bulk vegetable crops and relatively modest amounts of animal protein; the agricultural systems of medieval China and Japan, chronicled by F.H. King in <i>Farmers of Forty Centuries</i>, are as good a model as any. Such an agricultural system will not support seven billion people, but then neither will anything else, and a decline in population as malnutrition becomes common and public health collapses is a sure bet for the not too distant future.<br><br>For similar reasons, the economies of the future will make use of human labor, rather than any of the currently fashionable mechanical or electronic technologies, as their principal means for getting things done. Partly this will happen because in an overcrowded world where all other resources are scarce and costly, human labor will be the cheapest resource available, but it draws on another factor as well.<br><br>This was pointed out many years ago by Lewis Mumford in <i>The Myth of the Machine</i>. He argued that the revolutionary change that gave rise to the first urban civilizations was not agriculture, or literacy, or any of the other things most often cited in this context. Instead, he proposed, that change was the invention of the world’s first machine – a machine distinguished from all others in that all of its parts were human beings. Call it an army, a labor gang, a bureaucracy or the first stirrings of a factory system; in these cases and more, it consisted of a group of people able to work together in unison. All later machines, he suggested, were attempts to make inanimate things display the singleness of purpose of a line of harvesters reaping barley or a work gang hauling a stone into place on a pyramid.<br><br>That kind of machine has huge advantages in an world of abundant population and scarce resources. It is, among other things, a very efficient means of producing the food that fuels it and the other items needed by its component parts, and it is also very efficient at maintaining and reproducing itself. As a means of turning solar energy into productive labor, it is somewhat less efficient than current technologies, but its simplicity, its resilience, and its ability to cope with widely varying inputs give it a potent edge over these latter in a time of turbulence and social decay.<br><br>That kind of machine, it deserves to be said, is also profoundly repellent to many people in the industrial world, doubtless including many of those who are reading this essay. It’s interesting to think about why this should be so, especially when some examples of the machine at work – Amish barn raisings come to mind – have gained iconic status in the alternative scene. It is not going too far, I think, to point out that the word “community,” which receives so much lip service these days, is in many ways another word for Mumford’s primal machine. For the last few centuries, we have tried replacing that machine with a dizzying assortment of others; instead of subordinating individual desires to collective needs, like every previous society, we have built a surrogate community of machines powered by coal and oil and natural gas to take care, however sporadically, of our collective needs. As those resources deplete, societies used to directing nonhuman energy according to scientific principles will face the challenge of learning once again how to direct human energy according to older and less familiar laws. This can be done in relatively humane ways, or in starkly inhuman ones; what remains to be seen is where along this spectrum the societies of the future will fall. That riddle neither Bilbo nor Gollum could have answered, and neither can I.

Observation of natural phenomena seems to be the only option for advancement for our predecessors. Hence so much importance placed on the traits of animals in their vicinity. Could humans have watched bees or ants and visualised themselves as having the capacity to work in such dedicated teams? Did we learn to build from the birds? Or did we too carry this instinct in us before slowly placing ourselves above all other creatures in the world around us? These questions all stem from sincere doubt that the basics infrastructure of a civilisation differs that greatly from the the various example of colony type insects, nest building creatures, and social herds. <br><br>Also, I just read Toynbee's book, (well most of it, the library needed it back) and there were a couple of chapters in particular in which I really saw parallels with your writing, whether you were directly inspired by them or just arriving at similar conclusions; independent co-arisings as my friend named the phenomena of the parallel evolution of ideas.<br><br>Ever since reading I've been thinking about America's limes versus its limen - where is that threshold now?

I wonder in what year will it be common to see a mix of pedestrians, horse riders, bicyclists, steam-powered vehicles, and a few high-end cars on a small city thoroughfare - all at the same time.<br><br>I suspect any remaining land transport engines will have to be configured to run on steam from wood and coal, and on ethanol distilled from wood and other forms of vegetation.<br><br>I look forward to innovative development of cellophane, cermaics, glass and polylactic acid (PLA) as a renewable resource replacements for plastics. But how will we obtain the chemicals and machinery and power to manufacture them?<br><br>Even smart architecture can do its part - witness the Persian windcatchers (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windcatcher) and Trombe or Morse walls (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trombe_wall). Capable of providing summer cooling to frigid temperatures and winter daytime heating to summertime temperatures. We aren't utilizing these old, yet incredibly useful technologies because oil and electricity is cheaper still, but I hope we start soon. <br><br>I wonder how much of a technological core needs to remain to continue development of advanced technology in the centuries ahead. I wonder whether future careers will involve the mining landfills for metals and plastics.<br><br>Will hydro-electric power continue to provide the benefits of electricity long after oil and natural gas infrastructures has become too expensive?

<div class="avtb a_a7fb36" id=c5080916123436264568></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/11970765107980643386 rel=nofollow>Don</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Your first riddle, the one about the machine, actually reminded me of one of Gollum's:<br>This thing all things devours:<br>Birds, beasts, trees, flowers;<br>Gnaws iron, bites steel;<br>Grinds hard stones to meal;<br>Slays king, ruins town,<br>And beats high mountain down.<br><br>I had initially thought the answer to your riddle was something similar to the answer to Gollum's, too. At first, I thought "wind," but I knew that was wrong because wind didn't raise the monuments, though it certainly had a role in destroying them.<br><br>At any rate, I wasn't prepared for the actual answer. Upon reflection, it seems obvious, though. And I can think of a very good example: between 1825 or so and the Civil War, the Ohio River valley east of Cincinnati became the USA's first important vineyard and wine producing region. The valley reminded the German settlers there of the valley of the Rhine, and putting it in vineyard must have made it even more Rhine-like. (Search Google Images for "Rhine vineyards" or "Rheingau," and you see what they look like.) I could imagine that the vineyards were planted along the steep slopes of the river gorge right down to the floodplain, just like the Rhine's. The main reason for cultivating the slopes is that the they would have very favorable microclimates for grape production, for several reasons I won't bore you with here.<br><br>The labor shortage caused by the Civil War, combined with a fungus disease called black rot that destroys the fruit before it's ripe caused the decline of the industry there and it never recovered.<br><br>Now, 175 years later, several enterprising souls are trying to revive the vineyards and the industry, and they're doing a very credible job. I visited one of the vineyards last autumn and immediately noted that the vines are planted on top of the ridge, not down the slope like the Rhine vineyards, or like I imagine the original Ohio River vineyards were. I asked why, given that the microclimate on top of the ridge isn't quite as favorable as those along the slope. The answer: the slope would be way too steep and dangerous for the tractor.<br><br>Cultivating those vines in the Rheingau is very human-labor intensive because they must use hoes and rakes, not modern power equipment. I can imagine that in the future, when tractors are no longer viable because of fuel cost and/or shortages, that we'll see the Ohio River vineyards, if the industry truly takes off, once again take advantage of the more favorable microclimates along the slopes.<br><br><a href=#c5080916123436264568 title="comment permalink">4/1/10, 6:27 AM</a><br><br>

Before the general use of coal and later, petroleum, we were limited to hydro, wind, firewood and, if the hunting was good, whale oil, to help us. But what formed the basis of our walking around energy usage was horse,and human, muscle power.<br> <br>Human power, beyond the personal and familial, was augmented by hired help and/or owned help. History is rife with doleful accounts of the later. In fact it was only in the 20th century that chattel slavery was finally abolished worldwide.

Since at this point, a college education benefits the college much more than the student -- who often never recovers financially from the impact of student loans on his or her pocketbook -- the higher education industry is a fine example of pork, and the decline of funding for it is a sign that even the middle classes can't count of their share of pig any more. <br><br>Sam, elen sila lumenn omentilmo!<br><br>Xhmko, it's an interesting question how the early civilizations moved past the informal cooperation of hunter-gatherer bands to create the disciplined human machine that made the pyramids possible. As for Toynbee, it's not a matter of independent invention on my part -- my thinking has been massively influenced by his work; I've got all ten volumes of his unabridged <i>A Study of History</i> on the bookshelf nearest my desk, and they're tolerably well thumbed. <br><br>Bbcomm, even the very gradual decline we've seen since 1970 has pushed social stresses in the US close to the breaking point. Much more decline, even if it's gradual, risks the arrival of a flashpoint at which those stresses will burst into active conflict. <br><br>Paul, all these are good points, and good questions to be thinking about just now. <br><br>Bill, slavery's tolerably common in nonindustrial societies, but far from universal, and societies that do without it tend to be more productive than those that cling to it, because free workers are by and large much better motivated than those whose sole motivation is avoiding the lash. Our descendants may well see it in one form or another, but it's not inevitable. <br><br>Ariel, good. The concentration camp internees provided a steady source of slave labor for munitions factories, and some very large German corporations spent the war years amassing sizable profits from their labor. <br><br>Don, that's an excellent example. In southern Oregon, where I used to live, the first stirrings of a local olive industry got under way a few years back. It's the same sort of thing: a suitable climate and a willingness to use labor-intensive methods opens up options not available to fossil fueled agriculture. <br><br>Robert, slavery still exists on at least three continents, so it can hardly be said to be waiting for a rebirth. Still, I suspect that in decentralized agrarian societies with modest supplies of salvaged tech that we're likely to get in the middle and far future, something closer to a medieval peasantry will prove more viable than slavery as such. <br><br>DIYer, field bosses are cheaper, and a lot easier to manufacture under deindustrial conditions. <br><br>Hapibeli, "dumber than a sack of hammers" is good -- I'll have to remember that. You're right, though, that the best thing most of us can do is to try to make appropriate preparations now.

First, if you look at the way we have behaved in recent centuries, there's not a whole lot of suggestion that society makes any difficult choices until it is forced to by circumstances that border on dire. Case in point -- the recent financial debacle. Have major reforms been made? No. Assessments of the current state of responsibility and rationality in the financial world are "just as bad as before, if not worse, but now with a guarantee of future taxpayer bailouts." Why? Because the total meltdown didn't actually happen. The "Great Recession" has not been painful enough for the people who comprise the power structure to trigger any real change. Major social change won't happen gradually and placidly; it'll be a long series of pushing the status quo way past its rational end until it crumbles and we are left with no means to resurrect it. <br><br>Another side effect of a long drawn out transition is that it leaves the industrial system free to continue to wreak more harm, environmental and social. I'm actually kinda hoping that the energy screws get tight fast enough to head off what appears to be a global resurgence of nationalism, just waiting to take on militaristic/fascistic form in various places, possible even here in the U.S. It may not be the likeliest scenario, but it would be in many ways substantially more unpleasant than economic depression. Which sounds worse, dying from food shortages or dying from wars? Large-scale totalitarian military regimes can't survive without abundant cheap energy.<br><br><a href=#c2844821483820091263 title="comment permalink">4/1/10, 9:22 AM</a><br><br>

The whole thing really demonstrated how the supporters of both major parties in this country are willing to blindly drink their respective flavors of Kool-Aid as if they were Sweet Nectar from Olympus. And this can be explained by the psychological deal that the US elite made with the US middle class (the priveleged working class, really). In return for getting a portion of the goodies of the industrial economy, the middle class is expected to be very willfully blind and ignorant to the extent of being immersed in a collective fantasy-world.

(If this were indeed a Stalinist dictatorship, those Tea-Party fools who have been smashing windows as part of a political temper-tantrum would be so very sorry they did that right now!)

Without a surplus above and beyond what is required by the "builder" of the primal machine, the builder is left to forming relatively egalitarian relationships with other people that are usually exhibited by indigenous peoples.<br><br>It's a mistake, IMO, to take a short view of history - especially when history has been so short.<br><br>Take a look at this graph and ponder it for a bit:<br><br>http://adaptiveness.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/holocene1.png?w=500&amp;h=230<br><br>No one discovered agriculture. People didn't wake up to the fact, some 10,000 years ago, that planting seeds in the ground resulted in a growing plant. They knew it all along. But they didn't engage in agriculture simply because the climate didn't permit it - it was too unstable, generation over generation, to allow people to develop sedentary lifestyles based around the cultivation of crops. <br><br>Once they did begin agricultural lifestyles, they discovered they could easily produce surplus - collections of solar energy that could be stored and weren't immediately required. So then, instead of raiding the tribe in the next valley over for their horses or goats, they raided them for their people and acquired slaves which could expand their solar collection systems - their farms.<br><br>That's all going to change - and quicker than one might think. The climate is by default notoriously unstable - the Holocene is a singular aberration in stability. And the Holocene is rapidly drawing to a close. The capacity to collect surplus solar energy will no longer be with us within two generations, maybe less, as the global climate reverts back to its usual mercurial self. And we humans will be reverting back to our usual egalitarian bands of relatively nomadic hunter/gatherers/herders/gardeners. But slavery, and farming, won't make another appearance on this planet for thousands of years if at all.<br><br><a href=#c3852738203441612082 title="comment permalink">4/1/10, 10:53 AM</a><br><br>

We are not "more evolved" than other forms; evolution does not have a goal, hierarchy, or strategy. Everything we do is a natural manifestation of our animal natures. We do not have a "higher self" and a "base self" any more than a wolf does; we are just ourselves. Building computers and rockets is as natural when we do it as it is for a beaver to build a dam or an oak tree to grow twigs skyward and roots earthward. We also make no sense without our environment. We live only in context; a person in isolation is very quickly a dead person. A person devoid of a community is an aberration; our natural tendency is towards the collective. The entire ecosphere (except maybe for the deep ocean thermal vents) can be conceived of as this great primordial solar-powered machine.

Very cogently put. <br><br>Dr. Travis, thank you!<br><br>Aaron, I don't think the evidence really supports your analysis of the origins of agriculture. The first agricultural societies came into existence while the climate of their region. the eastern Mediterranean was still in chaos -- there's good reason to think that they turned to planting crops when the local ecology became unable to sustain hunter-gatherer cultures and growing edible grass seeds was the only alternative to starvation. For that matter, the Holocene has been a good deal less stable, in terms of climate, than the research of an earlier generation suggested. <br><br>By the way, hunter-gatherers have also practiced slavery -- you might want to look into the prevalence of the slave trade up and down the west coast of Native North America in precontact days -- so I'm afraid your argument wouldn't hold up even if the climatic argument worked. <br><br>Michael, sure thing. Drop me an email via info (at) aoda (dot) org and I'll be in touch, so we can do this by email. <br><br>Hugger, er, you need to read up on the pyramids. They weren't built by slaves or POWs; archeologists have found wage records, and graffiti on stones boasting about how the work crew from Abydos kicked the butts of the guys from Heliopolis. As for the rest of your racialist fantasy, well, let's just say your views have nothing whatsoever in common with mine, and leave it at that. <br><br>Tom, that all sounds very good, but what are you doing right now to bring it about? <br><br>Bill, I can certainly handle a Druid sermon. Still, it's worth remembering that another thing that's natural to humans is striving to make ourselves and our world a better place. <br><br>Adrian, you should certainly read Toynbee. As for Tolkien, it's a source of wry amusement to me that popular culture borrows so heavily from him while missing all the most potent things he has to say about contemporary culture. I should probably do a post on that sometime.<br><br>Joel, good. Yes, the primal machine taps into very deep biological drives; that's one of the reasons it's as powerful as it is.<br><br><a href=#c3061078806510218010 title="comment permalink">4/1/10, 2:48 PM</a><br><br>

After this and previous work at a coal plant I've realized that nothing can compete with $10/ton western coal on an energy cost basis. It is something like 32 times less than a gallon of gas. The recent thought I had was that if you can't beat them, join them. What I mean is what if coal was used as, in a clean low cost gasifier manner to fuel the development of the resilent communities that we need?<br><br>Actually in some states I think you could net meter coal as a Combined Heat and Power plant. I think this would be a money maker, if you were sited close enough to a railroad or mine. <br><br>I mean long term you wouldn't want a community to rely on coal, but what if in the short term keep things financially afloat and hedge against oil pricing?<br><br><a href=#c4374897983866248393 title="comment permalink">4/1/10, 3:40 PM</a><br><br>

However, I had the privilege of seeing it in action and participating in it last weekend on a working bee up at a small not-for-profit skifield in the mountains of New Zealand. This place runs on 1930s-era lift technology that you would have found in the United States when skiing first began, plus a good degree of more modern throw-away machinery. <br><br>The fascinating thing is that these places continue to thrive here (there are about 8 of them), and can normally find a good supply of volunteer labour to keep them ticking over.

I tend to see it as one of the unfortunate side effects of the myth of progress: when people believe that history has to get better by definition, they don't put as much effort into making it better. <br><br>Kabir, coal has some pretty substantial drawbacks, and unless you happen to live close to the mine you're putting yourself at the mercy of the transportation network. Why not concentrate instead on using local diffuse energy sources, such as sunlight, and accept the higher cost as part of the price of resilience? <br><br>BrightSpark, you'll find Mumford's discussion of the machine all through both volumes of <i>The Myth of the Machine</i>. It's a valuable insight, and as your example points out, it doesn't have to be used in an oppressive manner. <br><br>Brad, my guess is that the process of moving people out of the formal economy into various local underground economies will happen by itself, as the formal economy contracts in real terms (no matter what its measures of abstract wealth do). There's already a very substantial underclass, and the implosion of state budgets will put a lot more people into it fairly soon; a lot of what will happen in the next century or so can probably be read once it's clear what that enlarged underclass chooses to do.<br><br><a href=#c6383992369417949451 title="comment permalink">4/1/10, 4:56 PM</a><br><br>

There are a number of countries that that are not US allies, yet have per capita incomes in the same range as the US. Switzerland, Sweden, Finland, Ireland, and maybe some others. In comparing their incomes to US income, you need to take into account the fact that these countries generally choose to take some of their prosperity in the form of more leisure, rather than more material consumption.<br><br>Note that none of these countries is now or ever was an empire (except maybe Sweden). <br><br>The tribute economy concept can explain a high US income but not the relatively high income of these other countries. So I don't find it convincing.<br><br>I remember that somewhere in George Orwell's essays he says that if it weren't for the Empire's exploitation of Asian peasants, the Brits would be very poor indeed.(He of course said it more pithily.) Well, the British lost their empire, and they are still a lot richer than most of the Asian countries they once exploited.<br><br>I don't think anyone has come up with a fully satisfactory explanation of why countries differ in per capita incomes.

I just felt like once again an historian had anthropocentrified a tendency that belongs to evolution, not humanity. Any form of centrism tends to really annoy me. The big ones being anthropocentrism and Eurocentrism. I'm sure most of the time is an unthinking variety of these that occurs, and that perhaps they don't intend superiority to be intrinsic in their statement but so often it is.<br><br>And speaking of people just wanting to make the world better for themselves and this striving being an innate trait. I also see the tendency where many to want to be the best they can at what they do. Unfortunately when you look at the roles that society has to offer (some recent inventions, others from that blurry background from which we came) it is possible for people to excel at jobs that spindoctor, discriminate and destroy. It's not a new thing, but it's definitely still a very real problem. <br><br>JMG, I spent quite a bit of my youth watching insects and birds do their thing. I watched ants work from morning til night and watched spiders build their webs from scratch. <br><br>I once followed a hornet(similar to a wasp if you don't know)around as it made its mud home. I watched as it went to the edge of a puddle and rolled up a ball of mud and then flew back to its worksite and using its own saliva a binder it then built its nest. <br>I would watch peachfaces weave their nests from grass and palm fronds; stripping fat leaves into smaller workable pieces and tucking them into their feathers before flying up to their nest.<br><br>And we'd crawl under the bush where the bower bird had made his love nest with all the bits of broken glass stacked up on the bed at the end of his amazing little tunnel of love.<br><br>These watchings taught me at a young age the intelligence of all life, whether it is on par with ours or not, it deserves much credit. You can put it down to instinct if you like but sometimes that just seems like saying that "I don't want to think about it any more"<br>And as I got older and thought more about our ancestors and how observation was the key to survival, I can't help but think that mimicry is what gave us the ability to move forward into a sedentry lifestyle (sounds like a contradiction in terms)<br><br>And growing up in close range to many indigenous people at home I have seen that their ways were absolutely about knowing the world around them: supreme naturalists.<br><br>I have heard stories about kids being taken after school (probably in about the 1950's)to the river to learn to recognise insect footprints from replicas made by an elder in the dirt with a stick.<br><br><a href=#c4543010578906403276 title="comment permalink">4/1/10, 8:14 PM</a><br><br>

Yes, that's a crucial point. All machines are simply reflections of nature, most often reflections of bits of the human body and mind. <br><br>Hugger, racism isn't outside the box. It's among the most shopworn notions of mainstream Western culture. I take it, though, that you aren't aware that I come from a multiracial background and a multicultural family, and I have very little patience with the cheap racial mythologies that you and so many others are purveying these days. <br><br>Sgage, good. If a product actually satisfies a need, that need can no longer be used to sell another product. <br><br>Don, the myth of the machine is a central theme of Tolkien's work -- and it's something he explores with a great deal more subtlety than most of his Sixties fans grasped. <br><br>Cathy, thanks for the link!<br><br>Kabir, yes, we're going to have some food shortfalls. One of the things I'm proposing as a way to start dealing with that is to start small -- backyard gardens and the like -- and focus either on noncommercial farming or on production for farmers markets and the like, so you're not competing directly with petroleum farmers. <br><br>Jack, of course there are several ways a nation can prosper, and some of the nations you've named are examples. All of them except Britain accepted a tacit bargain with the US at the end of the Second World War, agreeing not to challenge US hegemony in exchange for trade benefits and the very large financial gain of having no more than a token military to support; Britain, for its part, is one of the inner circle of US allies, and traded us its empire in exchange for a very sizable cut of the proceeds. <br><br>T, I'm quite aware that a great many people, in and out of the seats of power, will do absolutely anything to keep things going more or less the way they are now. That doesn't give them the power to overturn the laws of physics or conjure concentrated energy out of twinkle dust -- nor, of course, will it spare them the consequences of their own bad decisions. As for my biases, that's always an easy argument to make; are you sure you're not drawing your conclusions on the basis of biases of your own?<br><br>Jack, fair enough.

Well, i live here, and Irelands wealth was ( yes, past tense) predicated upon its unquestioning kow-towing to low regulation unfettered Banksterism. Our 'wealth' wasnt even built upon the illusion of sand. We basically played Monopoly for the last 15 years, and have recently woken up to reality. Now, we have a beautifully indentured future to which we can look forward. All in the name of maintaining 'confidence' in Ireland Inc. so that International Investors and Government Bond-Holders arent scared off. We should have done an Iceland, instead we ( the taxpayer/ citizen / consumer ? ) have bowed to the mighty Gods of Wall street. So yeah, I agree totally that we are part of the tribute economy, and must pay homage to the naked Emperors. <br><br>Finally, I have oft wondered where our advanced societies will end up.<br>We used to think about how we can raise Africa to first World standards.

If there was one poster child for the so-called global economy it was Ireland, and the basis of Ireland's status was/is based on it mutually parasitic relationship with corporate and government USA. We provide tax avoidance structures for US Corporations (and some EU corps) in return for solicitor, accounting and back office banking jobs. We also provide job skills as well as tax avoidance for many US pharamceutical companies (the US legistlation on health care will be positive for Ireland). In return for jobs, we accept the US way of doing business, and we provide the US military with full use of Shannon airport without any undue restriction. We also assist in arms manufacture.<br><br>As regard GNP/GDP per capita data, you should also consider that Ireland has income disparity in line with US standards. The working people, outside of US concerns, are being roasted alive. Our GDP has fallen by over 10% and wage cuts of up to 15-20% are the norm. Immigration is rampant again.<br><br>If ever there was a vassal country paying tribute then Ireland fits the bill every 17th of March when our leadership flies over to the US with sham shamrock in hand to pay symbolic tribute in lieu of the daily machinsations which constitute Ireland's meagre position vis a vis its US benefactors.<br><br>I don't necessarily disagree with your thesis, but Ireland was a bad example mate. gl<br><br><a href=#c7543373562364214807 title="comment permalink">4/1/10, 10:41 PM</a><br><br>

Until I saw her comment, I was going to link to it myself. Reading through these comments, there seems to be a theme of "what if" or "when" slavery will happen, and treating it as some historical anachronism that's been done away with. I believe you pointed out, JMG, that slavery exists today on three continents. In fact, it's more widespread than that. It's here in the States, even if you set aside those forced into the sex industry. I recall reading a few years ago about a tomato grower in Florida who was using physical force to prevent migrant laborers from walking off the job, and in the Carolinas, farmers were mistreating and refusing to pay illegal immigrants, then threatening to turn them over to Immigration if they tried to leave or seek help.<br><br>Two things I found interesting in the video may prove relevant: Bale found a correlation between slavery and industries that are destroying the environment the fastest. If slavery becomes more widespread, then, perhaps this would contribute to the acceleration of catabolic collapse.<br><br>The other thing was that slavery is most prolific in places that have weak or corrupted enforcement of law. I find this especially disturbing, as part of the collapse is the dismantling of government services. Particularly if those last few powers able to influence government have an interest in letting slavery happen, I don't think we'll be able to rely on traditional law enforcement agencies to protect us much against slavery. <br><br>Indeed, given how the prison labor industry has grown in this country over the last couple decades, I expect that what remains of police agencies may essentially end up being slavers. Nobody cares about convicts being put to work until they or their loved ones are convicted of frivolous charges so they can be put to work, and by then it's too late.<br><br><a href=#c3999357110341372581 title="comment permalink">4/1/10, 10:59 PM</a><br><br>

This desire seems to cut across most spectrums of politics here regardless of the actual carrying capacity of the environment. Still all in all, if you take oil out of the equation, it should fall back to a sustainable equilibrium? Our basic lack here is reliable water and top soil.<br><br>The other thing that comes to mind from your essay is that to my mind globalisation is simply another form of slavery. People may argue relativisms between countries and cultures but they are dressing up the situation. <br><br>To our shame in Australia, slavery operates here and now. There are people who are brought in from overseas by unscrupulous individuals for fruit and vegetable picking and basic agricultural work even in rural areas with unemployment. They aren't paid much and the conditions are not so good. Often if an employer doesn't want to pay them, they tip off the Immigration Department. Other enterprises that come to mind are illegal brothels. It's happening now although it is most definitely against the law.<br><br>Australia was settled by the British Empire for strategic and resource exploitation reasons using none other than convict labour which was little better than slavery. What do you do with the excess unemployed, n'er do well part of the population? Send them somewhere else! It would have been the equivalent of travelling to Mars today. Few if any of them (convicts or colonists) were ever able to return from whence they came.

Sweden, Switzerland, and Finland all spend from 1%-2% of their GDP on their military, which is substantial, when you consider that the US only spends about 4%. And they, unlike the US, have compulsory military service, imposing a significant nonmonetary burden. Relative to their resources, their they have much more than token military forces. <br><br>One other problem with your tribute theory is that China is a major source of the "tribute."

Witness the recent bailouts to see who is holding who by the short hairs. Even the angry worker seems to understand that if the government (state or Fed) starts to push back at a multi-national, they just move offshore.<br><br>But I think we need to keep crying “Peak Oil” in the wilderness, as much as some did with climate change, which is, at least, finally on most people’s radar, though they are still trying to deny it. There was a news article today accusing speculators of running up the price of oil “while it is in ample supply for the next year” – as if short term were the only yardstick. It did mention the almost 19 billion barrels per day that the US uses… but in no way tried to put that in context for the mainstream reader. That’s somehow what those of us in communications fields need to try and do: create a mental picture that is irrefutable (I’m thinking about doing a comic book) showing mainstream America that it’s “use it AND lose it”, rather than “use it or lose it”. <br><br>My personal feeling is that Obama opened up off-shore drilling because he realizes we can’t hold the Middle East much longer; without being able to say it, I think his administration is scrambling desperately closer to home, because that’s all we’ll have left soon.

Of course that works out to a modest amount of the US economy, since it's exactly my point that the US economy is being massively inflated by tribute. As for China, empires don't just get tribute from their allies! I've also discussed more than once the role of globalization in all this, and China's done very well in that context. <br><br>Aaron, of course agriculture appeared in different places, but the eastern Mediterranean was the heartland of Old World agriculture and there's plenty of evidence for stimulus diffusion from there as a major role for the other Old World agricultural seedbeds. (The New World, of course, had its own agricultural revolution several millennia later.) None of that invalidates my point, which is that climatic stress forced people to downshift from hunter-gatherer lifestyles in a relatively wet climate to farming methods that could keep going in drought conditions. As for slavery among the Native Americas, I gather you didn't actually read what I wrote, because the native peoples of the West Coast -- which were the ones I mentioned -- were in fact hunter-gatherers right up to the point of European contact, and they had a lively slave trade.<br><br>Cathy, my guess is that Obama opened up the coasts to oil drilling because it's beginning to sink in that the Dems are heading for a massive hit in the midterm elections, and he's trying to take as many debating points away from the GOP as he can.

One of the things that characterises human beings above other animals are the number of relationships we have with other species. Typically we refer to this as domestication because we see ourselves as somehow superior to our symbiont's. But the key word is symbiosis. There is a principle in cybernetics called “the law of requisite variety” essentially this states that “the controlling system must be more adaptable than the controlled system”. So reindeer don't follow Laplanders, Laplanders follow reindeer. The Laplanders are capable of more variety in their behaviour than the reindeer are and have adapted to the habits of the animals that they “control”.<br>Back in the mists of time this principle surely held true when people began to associate with canines. That is those of us who first associated with dogs learned to behave more like dogs. We integrated with a pack hunting carnivore. And those of us who first associated with goats learned to behave like goats. I wonder what it was like the first time dog people met goat people? And I wonder how many of the fruits of this human-human pack herd relationship are still with us today?<br><br><a href=#c838310555252874794 title="comment permalink">4/2/10, 1:45 PM</a><br><br>

What gives his work its power is the depth to which it pursues the psychological and spiritual dimensions of its analysis. Think of what Treebeard says about Saruman: "He has a mind of metal and wheels." When you become obsessed with the kind of power a machine gives you, in other words -- "wheels without wheels, with cogs tyrannic moving by compulsion each other," in Blake's phrase -- you begin to lose the capacity for any more human kind of interaction, and you slip into a very particular kind of stupidity that can't grasp the possibility that anybody else can see the world in another way.<br><br>Have you read the astonishing essay comparing the psychology of Morgoth and Sauron in <i>Morgoth's Ring</i>, one of the last volumes of his collected writings? It's an utterly unforgiving autopsy of the spiritual pathologies of industrial culture. You're right that it's something worth writing about, but I don't see any way to do that at less than book length -- not and make the thing worth doing -- and that'll depend on finding a publisher willing to contract the thing in advance. <br><br>Chris, that's good. I've been known to suggest that people who don't get the point you're making ought to push a car for 35 miles, and then remember that they've just exerted the effort contained in one gallon of gasoline -- but the soft drink can metaphor is in some ways even better. <br><br>Wordek, I've lost the reference, but quite a few years ago I read a comparison of human and wolf societies as an example of convergent evolution. Both species have much the same kind of hierarchy, with an alpha male usually in charge and other members of the pack sorted out below via a rough and constantly renegotiated pyramid of relative status. It's probably for this reason that canids were the first animals human beings ever domesticated, by many thousands of years: our pack rules and theirs were close enough that it didn't take much work to become members of a common pack. Inspiration from goats and the like may have played a role later on, as you suggest, but I suspect the basic pattern goes way back in hominid history. <br><br>Mageprof, thank you for the reference -- I read that book years ago, and haven't been able to find the reference since. <br><br>Francis, thank you!<br><br><a href=#c2484410500623519884 title="comment permalink">4/2/10, 3:37 PM</a><br><br>

Sometimes, when I think about peak oil, I just kind of scratch my head and think, you know, it's really not that bad -- spread the population around, give everyone a bit of land, and just get serious with biointensive food-growing and land improvement methods. (Something I'm going to start looking into soon is Eliot Coleman's four-seasons farming methods.)

As far as food production per acre, permaculture techniques produce far more food. Monocropping is incredibly inefficient in that respect. The main issue preventing permaculture type techniques from taking off is that they require a whole lot more human labor. They are quite intensive. In a future where labor is once again cheap, I don't see that being an issue. The issue will then most likely be that when the techniques are needed and viable, there won't be enough people with the necessary experience.

My family's ancestry covers five continents between my wife and children, and as such it seems to me that returning to Hawaii (big island specifically, which still has a smaller population than in pre-contact Hawaiian times, so population pressure isn't much of an issue) would be the safest as far as avoiding exploding racial tensions go. <br><br>What are your thoughts on the role of racial scapegoating in the upcoming predicament?

It's affordable for many people, it gives people the chance to work through the hard part of the learning curve, and it can make a very substantial contribution in crisis situations -- think Victory Gardens and the little garden plots that kept most of Russia fed when the Soviet economy collapsed. Ernest Thompson Seton's mantra -- "where you are, with what you have, right now" -- has rarely been so applicable. <br><br>Joan, no argument there. <br><br>Justin, see my comment to Matt. As for the racial issue, I look white, and something like a quarter of white Americans have, as I do, some First Nations ancestry, so I don't expect it to be a problem. My mixed cultural background -- I grew up with a Japanese stepmother and a flurry of relatives -- is even less visible at a glance, for that matter.<br><br>More generally, the once-frozen racial divides in this country are becoming increasingly fluid. Here in Cumberland, in what has historically been a part of the country with hard racial lines, I see a lot of mixed-race couples, and even more mixed-race groups of kids hanging out and playing together. I was interested to hear a few years back that Confederate heritage groups are now welcoming the descendants of black soldiers who fought for the Stars and Bars -- and yes, there were a fair number of those.

Although I am integrated into both a rural and urban community (not as a 9 to 5 commuter though) few if any people (only one other - who also put me onto this blog - Hi Ben!) I know express concerns for the issues that you raise.<br>It's interesting in a rural environment as most large scale farmers I talk with seem to think oil and super phosphates will go on forever. They don't take organics or permaculturalists very seriously at all and indeed they are no commercial threat. The advantage of the fossil fuel subsidy is that they can produce and transport their produce cheaper. Oh well.<br>Back to slavery though, I think that it is within human nature of some people to take advantage of others. There was a famous shipwreck off the coast of Western Australia in the 17th century called the Batavia. It is a good example of what can happen with group dynamics and psychopaths. Not nice... Getting back to the point though, there are enough of these nutters around to cause trouble for the rest of the population. Another example is the bush rangers that used to roam around this part of the forest not that long ago.<br>The only way out of this predicament for people in remote areas is to make yourself useful in some manner, such as what you suggested with the skilled practitioners from the Caribbean piracy era. It may work with slavers as well? Who knows?<br>PS Have you ever read "The Mabinogion" by Evangeline Walton? I'm looking forward to starting "Engine Summer" by John Crowley.

It's harder to explain their role in the system but I think it's less one-sided than the US and more of a mix - Japan and Germany (and even Sweden to some extent) are still manufacturing nations producing cars and hi-tech that people want; others such as the UK and Australia participate actively in the American Empire and are effectively an extension of it. Of course all these countries have some mix of both going on, just in different proportions.<br><br>Regarding Ireland and Iceland, I say as an Icelander that the countries behaved very similarly in the past 15 years and have seen very similar economic and social consequences from it. I wish our nations had a closer relationship because we have plenty of common interests, such as countering English predation and defending our common wish to be independent and sovereign islands (in every sense).<br><br>@Tigerbaby: "We should have done an Iceland" - yes you should, although I'm not yet sure if Iceland itself is managing "an Iceland"!

Under natural conditions, they travel and hunt in family groups. Research that noted alpha-male and pack behaviors was done with wolves in captivity, who were essentially trying to form a family group with random individuals. When the big pack was released into Yellowstone a few years back, it gradually disintegrated into smaller sub-groups. Hmmm...<br><br>Justin, I was touched by your thought about returning to Hawaii to avoid racial static. I experienced plenty of racial static there as a white person; I don't think there's a place on earth without these shadows lurking in the background. Are they the most profound reason upon which to base a decision to relocate?<br><br>The collapse problem on the islands, as I see it, was nailed in your previous paragraph: "The issue will then most likely be that when the techniques are needed and viable, there won't be enough people with the necessary experience. As with any craft, intensive agriculture takes a great deal of time to master..."<br><br>When Hawaii was a permaculture paradise, territories were divided between ocean and mountain, because every zone had its goodies, from the sea-weeds to the forests with growing fields in between. Now that nearly all foodstuffs are imported, the forests are gone, and resorts choke the beaches, it's going to be dicey to get everyone to snap out of tourist dollar mode, and gather down at the taro patch.<br><br>But now is the time to act and get yourself to where you NEED to be. Ultimately, after weighing all the criteria we think is important; land, water, population density, racial static, etc., it really comes down to one question: Where is my true Home? It's time to be Home, and if Hawaii is home, then pack up your canoe! <br><br>Now to tie three apparently disparate threads together: I was thrilled to see Mageprofs reference to "Musclar Bonding" - "...the intense pleasure that is naturally felt by people in groups who use their big muscles briskly and in unison."<br><br>This phrase describes exactly my experience dancing hula. Yes, Hawaiian hula, though not the kitschy Hollywood, grass skirt cliche, but the ancient kahiko style for men. Every movement tells part of a story, and the whole group moves in unison, at our best, like a school of tropical fish. Sometimes I am inexplicably moved to tears by the synchronicity and grace of our otherwise clutzy group of geezers. But the local hula dancers in town now number well over 100, men, women and children, and we all love each other somehow; we've become a community without really trying. <br><br>I find myself describing hula as a vigorous work-out for body, mind, and spirit, like tai-chi with better music, but the truth is closer to this: we are practicing social permaculture, learning how to emulate the bees without realizing it, while getting in all kinds of good shape, building invisible resiliency.<br><br>But "muscular bonding" doesn't come close to describing it, "the world's oldest machine" even less. We can't reverse engineer the impulse to become re-indiginous to our homes. Machines were modeled after human movements, so perhaps we might try picking up where that left off? There's more Mystery than Mechanics in all of this.<br><br>For those curious, this next week is the Olympics of hula, the Merrie Monarch Festival, where the best hula dancers in the world gather to compete (video streaming online).

A meaningful response to your question would take at least a post by itself, but the short form is that the interface between the metaphysical and the historical exists wholly within the individual; it can and does reshape individual destinies, but hoping that it will fix the world for us is one of history's classic recipes for disaster. <br><br>As for the event at Four Quarters, thanks for the heads up!

Mumford harshly criticized the rise of the ancient Megamachine during what he called the Pyramid Age in Egypt. He believed that Ancient Pharaonic Egypt was the prototype for what we now call totalitarianism.<br><br>The ancient Machine was an incredibly brutal form of social organization, relying upon social regimentation, human slavery, and constant wars of extermination. Opposition was intolerable. Kings were divine, or descendants of divinity, and resistance to their rule was not only treasonous but also an absolute evil. Hence all of the savage tortures and executions used by kings, pharaohs, and emperors.<br><br>Mumford wrote that the <i>ancient</i> Megamachine was revived and revised in 16th-century Europe as the <i>modern</i> Megamachine. The modern Megamachine now relies heavily upon non-human machines -- our inanimate technology using fossil and radioactive energy sources (well, hydroelectric power, also).<br><br>But the terrible <i>myth</i> of the machine, Mumford writes, is a largely unconscious stew of "demonic compulsions" within the human mind, which is now allied with modern <i>megatechnics</i>, giving our 21st-century Divine Kings nightmarish and monstrous powers.<br><br>We're all living <i>inside of</i> the modern Megamachine. As environmental degradation and resource depletion continue, the <i>modern</i> Megamachine will eventually collapse. Or it will "devolve" back into the ancient human machine. But I certainly don't want to live inside the ancient model anymore than I want to live in the modern one.<br><br>Mumford condemned the use of the machine myth or the mechanical world-view as a basis for human societies. Apparently he hoped that a new form of society was emerging out of resistance to the Machine in the sixties and seventies, something he called <i>biotechnics</i>. Mumford could be vague in his descriptions, but I interpret biotechnics to mean human society and technology centered around human life and needs. These cannot be separated materially, and therefore sanely and non-destructively, from the lives and needs of non-human organisms.<br><br>I do foresee a return to the ancient model of the Megamachine, the old human machine, unfortunately. It will be resurrected by Those In Charge for the stated goal of collective survival. I don't know how well it will succeed. I would prefer that humanity seek to recreate other forms of community.<br><br><a href=#c6895155221324769266 title="comment permalink">4/3/10, 9:07 PM</a><br><br>

A nap has done wonders for my mental clarity)<br><br>@Bill - I am not really a big fan of the term permaculture, as I don't agree with the decision to trademark the term and charge hundreds of dollars for classes and certifications. I chose the term (actually, I think I said "permaculture type techniques) to simply differentiate a more mindful style of farming from the thinly veiled industrial mono-cropping that is called "organic" these days. Unfortunately for your first question, all the controlled studies I've seen only pit mono-cropped, extensive industrial agriculture with mono-cropped "organic" extensive industrial agriculture, with predictably poor results. I can give you all kinds of anecdotal evidence of what is possible with layered food forests and waste recycling in every aspect of planning a garden (etc), but I have a feeling you already agree with me, but took issue with my choice of words. Please suggest a better word to express this type of gardening.<br><br>As far as the racism in appalachia, I guess I was extrapolating from my experiences in the midwest. I am glad to hear that it is better out there, though it doesn't make me to proud of Illinois. Suffice to say the rural midwest isn't nearly as progressive as out there. From time spent out in SC visiting my wife's family, I would hazard a guess that the deep south may be worse. At least, I've never had so many evil stares with my mixed family than I had around Charleston.<br><br>@hawlkeye <br><br>I agree that there is some racial static towards whites in HI, but it is far easier to avoid in my experience (I'm white). A deep appreciation of Hawaiian/local culture and having local friends goes a long way. On the other hand, in some rural areas on the mainland, such as the town I grew up in, there is no way to avoid hatred if you're black. KKK literature was passed out on my school bus in high school, and I've seen incredible displays of bigotry. I don't think that would be a safe environment for an extremely mixed family if law an order start to break down. I believe something like 2/3 of Hawaiian marriages are inter-racial, so it is a complete non-issue.<br><br>On the other hand, I'd want to be in Hawaii even if that wasn't an issue. It is ridiculously easy to grow food, and shelter consists of a roof to keep rain off. Unlike most other lush tropical locations, you don't have to deal with a horde of tropical diseases, poisonous animals and language/cultural barriers (not to mention the armed death squads that pop-up from time to time throughout latin america and africa).<br><br>I can live easily (though not pleasantly) off the land if need be, which is certainly not the case on the mainland. I do plan on returning, but my income would cease, so I'd like to get a bit of money for land together first. I am in the process of developing back-up plans if things move to quickly and I can't afford to return, hence my interest in appalachia.<br><br><a href=#c4784882328366244517 title="comment permalink">4/4/10, 1:50 PM</a><br><br>

It's more the marketing hype, and the extent to which providing training seems to have become an end in itself in the US permaculture scene; I've seen very, very few people here putting the techniques to work in more than a demonstration-model context. If that continues, the US branch of the movement at least may end up turning into a multilevel marketing scheme in which you get trained for the purpose of being able to provide trainings, rather than for the purpose of doing anything with the training. <br><br>David, one of the places where I disagree with Mumford is precisely his characterization of the primal machine as inherently demonic. McNeil's book is a good counter to Mumford's overly dualistic thinking in this case (and some others). The primal machine doesn't require or, really, even benefit that much from a totalitarian ethos; a quilting bee or a bucket brigade putting out a fire is as good an example of it as a slave-worked plantation. What defines it is the ability of human beings to coordinate their actions down to a very fine level under a common intention. <br><br>Shiva, thanks for clarifying! I'm not at all sure what to say, other than that my experience differs from yours. I hear a lot of talk about changing consciousness, veiling a lot of thinking and action that dresses up the same old nonsense in pseudomystical drag. I'd be a good deal more hopeful if I saw more evidence that people were willing to reconsider their belief that the universe exists to keep them happy and comfortable! Still, I remain willing to be wrong. As for Four Quarters, I've been there -- a very pleasant place. <br><br>Er, Wordek, Montgolfier did live 150 years later; his name was Robert Goddard, and his principle of levity put rockets into orbit. I'm no fan of the mess that's been made of public education, but I find it hard to justify the claim that it's stopped free inquiry in its tracks. <br><br>Tristan, nah, the ring that can be made these days was the one Wagner talked about... <br><br>"As its gold gave me might without measure;<br>Now may its magic bring death to the one who wears it!<br>It shall gladden no happy man;<br>Its gleam shall light on no one lucky.<br>Who has it shall be consumed with care,<br>Who has it not shall be gnawed by envy.<br>Each shall be greedy for its goodness, <br>But none shall find any use in it!<br>Uselessly its lord shall guard it,<br>For it will bring him his executioner!<br>Given over to death, he shall be fettered by fear; <br>All his life he shall long for death;<br>The Ring's master shall be a slave to the Ring!" <br><br>...but that's a topic for another post. <br><br>Librarian, bingo. The Hobbits replanting trees all over the Shire are as much an example of the primal machine as Sauron's armies. One of the places where I quarrel with Tolkien, as it happens, is his tendency to make his villains' spear carriers incapable of being anything better. If elves can fall, why can't orcs rise -- as their equivalents in the real world do routinely? But again, that's a topic for a different post. <br><br>Xhmko, fair enough. <br><br>Justin, duly deleted!<br><br><a href=#c7076460141326118898 title="comment permalink">4/4/10, 3:52 PM</a><br><br>

Since this will never happen please feel free to criticise it from any angle you choose. Here it is:<br><br>If every school student at say the age of thirteen as part of that single school year chose one energy system to study, over the course of 30 years or so the “residual echo” of that knowledge throughout the wider culture will largely solve the power generation and storage problems.<br><br>I suggest this is a wacky proposal because the crux of the problem isn’t so much that other sources of energy aren’t practicable, its that civilisation has become almost entirely dependent on one form of energy. And it isn’t even that this was “chosen” because its the best and most easily available source of energy. None of us can go out to our fuel wells with a bucket and fill up our cars. Ironically oil as a popular power source made its way into popular use primarily because it is not widely available or easily converted into energy. This proposal will never be implemented because the primary question which has always driven the resources given to technical development around energy exploitation has never been:<br><br>A) How can we produce energy into the future….. its<br><br>B) How can I get rich off the rubes<br><br>And oil fits that bill very nicely<br><br>Lets be honest, the list of energy sources tucked away in natures nooks and crannys is almost endless: Methane caltrates – thermo-generation seebeck stirling etc – RTG Strontium-90 Plutonium-238 etc – Thorium reactors – hydrogen – hydro including tidal, wave etc – geothermal – solar – coal – wind – wood – and all the other stuff I don’t know about.<br><br>But hydrogen has never made it through development for commercial use not because its scarce or the technology is too difficult, but because of its ubiquitousness; a child can produce it with nothing more than a lemon and a stick of zinc. High efficiency devices or engines face developmental roadblocks precisely because they are resource efficient . Any paradigm involving distributed power generation gets throttled because its ongoing production is not able to be centrally exploited. The energy required to plant a thousand trees, can be measured on the fingers of one hand, where the energy unit measure is tomato sandwiches!<br><br>Why are there power lines to your house? Not to supply you with easy power, they are there to supply others with easy access to your wallet.<br><br>Many people have noted that in a sense humanity is a giant computer (42?). But careless and deliberate application of the garbage in garbage out principle (i.e.: Brittney Spears &gt;&gt; My neighbours daughter – Happy clapper type religion, political fear-mongering etc ad nauseum) ensures that most of the rubes will always be little more than low grade resources in this “machine”. And indeed its not their role to put back, only to consume. This was the real roadblock, we had every opportunity to become more than we were and blew it by being so easily convinced that its our right and our place to magically become some version or another of the gods eternal children.<br><br>I’m sure you recognise some exceptions to, and over-generalizations in this commentary. I certainly do. But the principle is sound. We could have easily had a low power high efficiency economy instead of the one we have now. But at those many points in history where the vital choices were made B always trumped A and still does.<br><br>I still maintain that some places will be lucky though. Will they be like us? I believe not. How will their culture evolve? Who knows. Will their internal system make its way out to influence some wider civilisation?

You have to use more energy to produce the hydrogen than you get from burning the hydrogen, and so if you want to launch a hydrogen economy, you have to have an energy source to produce all that hydrogen -- not to mention all the infrastructure needed to produce, distribute, and use the hydrogen. <br><br>As for "lots of energy in nature's crannies..." Er, did you read last week's post? The raw quantity of energy doesn't mean a thing; what matters is how much you have once you finish extracting it and concentrating it to a useful form, and with the vast majority of the energy available to us, that amounts to "not much." That's the heart of our predicament. It's very comforting, granted, to blame that predicament on the machinations of the rich and powerful (or some other scapegoat), but thinking in those terms doesn't help us deal with what we're facing.<br><br><a href=#c5537737007572105502 title="comment permalink">4/4/10, 9:08 PM</a><br><br>

These are reasonable, if over generalized and a bit dogmatic; they are however for the most part not new. Permaculture is a nice compendium of practices and ideas that have been around in some cases since prehistory. The problem is with the packaging, "jargonification," and merchandising. In that way is has become far too similar (for my tastes) to the pervasive turn-of-the-millenium madison avenue - corporate speak frame of mind, which is antithetical to the goals it is supposed to be striving towards. As for right and wrong, my world doesn't deal in those terms, at least not in the big picture. Dualistic thinking is another of those unhelpful habits we humans like to get stuck in. <br><br>I live in a Transition Town (tm) and a hotbed of Financial Permaculture (tm). It was neither of these things when I first moved here, being just an isolated hillbilly town (a term the locals apply to themselves proudly, it's not an insult) with an unemployment problem, ideal climate, friendly atmosphere, and cheap real estate. Back in those long ago days (i.e. 2002) I was very interested in and sympathetic towards Permaculture when I was learning of it purely from books. As I gained more direct exposure to the Permaculture Movement (tm), however, my opinion shifted. The recent advent of Financial Permaculture (tm) has turned me rather firmly against it. When I go to the Financial Permaculture (tm) websites the corporate speak and jargon are layered on so thick I can scarcely decode what they are actually talking about. Jargon is almost always an attempt to cloak ideas that are either old or dubious in an aura of new and shiny. <br><br>I also notice that with some notable exceptions, most Permaculture advocates talk and plan much, but actually implement surprisingly little. Meanwhile the hillbillies in coveralls, baseball caps, and accents straight from "Hee Haw" are resurrecting small-scale local agriculture, raising and selling tens of thousands of eggs and tons of local produce, all through existing channels and without polysyllabic jargonomics. <br><br>Justin -- the South, like any other region, is culturally far less homogeneous than most think. Charleston SC is socially one of the most conservative cities in the region. In Atlanta, or even Nashville, no one would hardly notice anything unusual about your family. If you are thinking of relocating ANYWHERE I recommend you throw all regional generalizations away, chose specific locations, and become familiar with their particular social attitudes. There are all kinds of people everywhere you go. I was in line at our local post office once as the clerk and a customer were trying to determine if a parcel destined for the PR of China was correctly addressed. The clerk chuckled and said "We're just a bunch of simple small town hillbillies here!" I commented "Yeah, but we've got people living in this town from all over the world." She nodded and agreed "That is the truth!"<br><br><a href=#c8988696483682081162 title="comment permalink">4/4/10, 9:19 PM</a><br><br>

Just go to a local library or a bookstore as people have already gone to the hassle of diseminating that information. The same goes for organic or non organic gardening. Even better, head out and meet people who are actually putting it into practice, they're usually more than happy to swap notes, answer questions etc. <br><br>It's best to glean information from all sorts of sources so that you can form your own opinion based on the reality that you are faced with.<br><br>As you quite rightly pointed out there does seem to be quite a lot more talking about local food production than what seems to be actually happening. We have a few hundred varities of fruit trees and are often scoffed at by the local farmers, but in any season here with the variability in our climate (a foretaste of what the rest of the world may soon be faced with because of global wierding), it's the only way to ensure you get at least some production.<br><br>Putting information into practice is one of the best ways to learn and is a very different method than what is taught in formal education (primary, secondary and university).<br><br>If you look at most religions there is no end of various groups, sects, permutations etc. It might get back to the fact that people are tribal in their nature and just want to belong to a group. The whole organic, permaculture, biodynamic thing is no different. From my point of view they have more in common than what separates them. I only hope that people understand the why of things and actually get out and practice it before it's too late.<br>Good luck and thanks again for an awesome blog!<br><br><a href=#c7634776277226690218 title="comment permalink">4/5/10, 1:15 AM</a><br><br>

I'll have to look into the whole "financial permaculture" (tm) business, too; in my experience, whenever the jargon starts flying fast and thick, what's under it is usually some kind of Ponzi scheme. But we'll see. <br><br>Wordek, of course hydrogen is a potential energy storage medium; the problem is purely where to get the energy to store. As for independence, no argument there; the problem with most energy sources in the universe is that they take so much technology to extract that independence becomes impossible -- you have to depend on a technostructure. Thus my suggestion that human muscles may be the best option we've got. <br><br>Cherokee, I hope permaculture doesn't complete the process of turning into a Ponzi scheme! It would be a pity to lose the positive things in the system. You're doubtless right that tribal loyalties are involved; a lot of alternative movements function primarily as a surrogate for community, a place to park loyalties that society as a whole no longer retains. <br><br>Oskar, my guess is that so many people are trying to reinvent Nature because that way it belongs to them. I mentioned earlier an essay by Tolkien about the psychology of his two Dark Lords, Morgoth and Sauron; according to him, what drove Morgoth -- and by implication, much of industrial humanity -- is a rage at the world for daring to exist as something separate from ego, something with its own origins and history and destiny, that can't simply be subsumed into the projected images of ego. Thus you could say that Morgoth was the first New Ager, insisting that the only reality is the one he creates for himself -- but he's also the iconic figure of the industrial-age consciousness of which the New Age is a late and extreme form.<br><br><a href=#c8245118467838469072 title="comment permalink">4/5/10, 6:52 AM</a><br><br>

The idea that the "oil lobby" is super-powerful and able to keep a whole planet of 7 billion people using an obsoleted fuel in the face of ubiquitous and easily accessible alternatives<br><br>Thats not quite an accurate description of my position. Think of the energy infrastructure as lantana or old mans beard or --insert your local pervasive weed plant here--. Other plants cant compete against it until the weed is cleared. Big oil is happy for alternative energy fans to do their thing. No one can really compete during the product development or implementation phases against the prices of such a well established industry in the “free” (read efficient not resilient -Tks JMG) market. Sure alternative energy has gained a tiny fingerhold by creating a “green market” through moral rather than economic appeal. But keep in mind that its not just the energy source thats the problem but that the whole infrastructure is built around massive waste. For instance cross country power lines will go. Too lossy. Massive fluctuations in oil prices for 15 years or so might incentivise action towards some mitigation of the impact here and there, But whatever happens its just all too little too late for “the system” as a whole to adjust gradually to a low energy locally focused paradigm. We have to look out for ourselves and what that ends up looking like will depend on your little patch of the world.<br><br><a href=#c5211111957620225007 title="comment permalink">4/5/10, 9:12 AM</a><br><br>

ADF takes a reconstructionist approach, emphasizing archaeological and literary evidence of the practices and beliefs of pre-christian Indoeuropean pagan societies. It is solidly within the Reconstructionist sphere of contemporary Neopaganism. Isaac stresses scholarly research into historic and prehistoric pagan cultures as a foundation of belief and practice. In contrast, AODA is a revival of a syncretist/eclectic movement that dates back only a few hundred years. It encompasses elements from many traditions, and under JMG's leadership is expanding into contemporary environmentalism. Personally I value both approaches; they appeal differently to different people. Both are living, evolving, contemporary American religions, with generally compatible values, morals, and ethical systems as they pertain to living on earth amongst fellow beings, human and otherwise. And, unlike many other religions large and small, both are completely honest and forthcoming about their origins, foundation, rational, and history.<br><br><a href=#c2165944143596027179 title="comment permalink">4/5/10, 2:33 PM</a><br><br>

It forecast that world production would peak in 2014 around 79 mbpd.<br><br>… On March 22, another bombshell exploded in the press as former UK chief scientist David King and researchers from Oxford University released a paper claiming that the world's oil reserves had been "exaggerated by up to a third," principally by OPEC….
