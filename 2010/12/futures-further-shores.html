Last week’s post on the future of the peak oil movement seems to have been timely. In and around the unraveling of global economic and political structures that accounts for a growing share of the evening news – Eliot’s “cracks and reforms and bursts in the violet air” have plenty of equivalents just now – quite a few figures in the peak oil scene have begun reorienting themselves to a world in which the coming of peak oil has stopped being a preoccupation of the fringe and become one of the simple and inescapable realities of our time.<br><br>This is not to say that all these reorientations are well advised. Sharon Astyk, for example, <a href=http://www.energybulletin.net/stories/2010-12-06/reaping-whirlwinds-peak-oil-and-climate-change-new-political-climate>has proposed</a> aligning the peak oil movement with climate activism; in the abstract, this is a logical idea, but in the real world it’s an invitation to disaster. The climate change movement has science solidly on its side, to be sure, but it’s proven hopelessly inept in dealing with the decidedly unscientific worlds of public relations and politics; climate activists have time and again allowed their opponents to define the terms of the debate, and relied on the prestige of science to make their case at a time when that prestige, already at a low ebb, is continuing to wane. Their opponents have not exactly been slow to take advantage of these missteps.<br><br>At this point we’re thus probably going to have to wait for the first major climate catastrophe to hit the industrial world before any of the world’s major polluting nations will be willing to change their ways. Aligning peak oil with the failing climate activism movement won’t change that, but will make it easier for the political establishments of the world’s nations to ignore peak oil for another few years; worse still, it might teach peak oil activists the same bad habits that have scuppered what was once a formidable climate activism movement, and produce similar results a second time around.<br><br>Rather more disturbing is Michael Brownlee’s <a href=http://www.energybulletin.net/stories/2010-11-26/evolution-transition-us>recent manifesto</a> calling for a new "Deep Transition" movement unique to the United States. Now of course the label "deep," when applied to any set of ideas, is a not very subtle way of calling the competition shallow, but there’s more going on here that that bit of one-upsmanship. Those of my readers who are familiar with the current flutter in alternative dovecotes around the rollover of the Mayan calendar in 2012 may notice a recognizable flavor in Brownlee’s prose; from the hammering on apocalyptic imagery to the sweeping vagueness of its proposed response – not omitting references to "the Sacred," that convenient catchall for the religious irreligiosity of our age – there’s nothing in it that would be out of place in the writings of yet another millennarian New Age sect.<br><br>Regular readers of this blog are aware that I have serious doubts about the Transition movement, but it has at least an even chance of doing some good as the industrial world stumbles through the opening decades of its decline and fall. Those mass movements for collective redemption that sociologists call "revitalization movements" are another matter, for the only thing that exceeds their emotional appeal in times of collective crisis is their futility in practice. Rob Hopkins’ <a href=http://transitionculture.org/2010/12/06/a-critical-response-to-michael-brownlees-call-for-deep-transition/ >measured response</a> to Brownlee’s manifesto made the same point in a typically understated way; it’s to be hoped that people involved in Transition here in the US will listen.<br><br>I’m glad to say, though, that not all the reorientations under way are as misdirected as the ones I’ve just cited. A much more promising example is under way at <a href=http://www.theoildrum.com/ >The Oil Drum</a>, which seems to be waking up to the fact that it’s become the de facto go-to place for quality peak oil information, and is adjusting its public presence in response. I find it particularly interesting to watch that adjustment in action, because one of the things the TOD community appears to be distancing itself from is me.<br><br>Witness the discussion in <a href=http://www.theoildrum.com/node/7185>the Drumbeat comments </a> a week ago, where a number of TOD regulars weighed in at some length about their discomfort with the phrase "green wizard." That’s exactly the sort of thinking TOD needs right now. In the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster, during which it provided what was quite literally the world’s best media coverage of the crisis and response, the Drum has a reputation to maintain and a global audience to address. I would not be the least surprised if ten years from now, the premier peak oil journal in print – the sort of peer-reviewed quarterly that every serious thinker in the field has to have on his or her bookshelf – is published by the nonprofit that runs TOD, and draws some of its best authors from the stable of bloggers that currently keeps TOD stocked with cutting-edge analyses and up-to-date information.<br><br>That isn’t the kind of project that would benefit from being associated with an archdruid who promotes green wizardry. Still, as one of the participants in the discussion pointed out, neither my audience nor my strategy are the same as theirs. A viable movement responding to the crisis of peak oil needs its sober websites packed with facts and figures, phrased and presented in terms both acceptable and compelling to the political and business elites who wield so much influence nowadays; still, that’s not the only thing it needs. It also needs a broad penumbra of individuals and small groups who are willing to explore those possibilities that don’t happen to appeal to men in business suits. The benefits that respectability brings to The Oil Drum would be wasted there; what’s needed, rather, is a willingness to pursue options outside the fashionable ideas of the moment. In a trajectory of that kind, a desire for respectability is a hindrance, and the wry embrace of an identity society as a whole rejects – for example, "wizard" – has quite commonly helped.<br><br>I’m pretty much restricted to such an approach, as it happens. It still surprises me how many people think I use the term "archdruid" as some sort of marketing gimmick, when it’s not exactly a secret that Archdruid is my job title, as head of one of the several dozen organizations that emerged from the 18th century revival of Druid nature spirituality. I try to wear my religion lightly in contexts where it’s not specifically relevant, such as this one, but it doesn’t take much searching on the internet to figure out that some of the beliefs I hold are not going to qualify me for respectability any time in this age of the world. The fact that <i>The Archdruid Report</i> was originally started with the intention of talking about peak oil and the future of industrial society to other members of the Druid community just adds spice to the resulting stew.<br><br>Still, a strategy of dissensus – the deliberate pursuit of radically different and even contradictory possibilities – is not simply a counsel of convenience for those who don’t have any other choice. If we’re to meet the crises ahead with even the smallest hope of something other than total failure, the options that need to be explored cannot be limited to those that the current political and business elites – the people whose decisions by and large got us into this mess, remember – happen to find acceptable. The resources that those elites can bring to bear are important, and need to be directed into anything that can be made acceptable to them – the rebuilding of the US rail system comes to mind as a very good start – but the options that can be made acceptable to today’s elites will only contain a small fraction of the options that need to be put to work.<br><br>That assertion doesn’t require belief in any deliberate conspiratorial intention on the part of those elites, by the way. The elites that mostly run today’s industrial societies, like their equivalents in every other human society, have a deeply conservative streak under whatever surface layer of fashionable radicalism may be popular at any given time. They have the positions of influence that they do because they have the educations, hold the opinions, and think the thoughts that their peers, and more particularly the immediately prior generation of their peers, considered suitable to their roles. In a society that’s more or less sustainable, this is a powerful source of stability; in one that’s stumbled into an unsustainable human ecology, these same pressures for elite conformity can make it next to impossible for anyone in charge to think about the world in any way other than the one that’s making disaster inevitable.<br><br>This is where dissensus and the deliberate encouragement of the eccentric, the improbable and the rejected come into their own. We are far past the point at which an organized, society-wide program to deal with the crisis of industrial civilization is possible – as the Hirsch report pointed out five years ago, that had to start twenty years before the peak of petroleum production, which puts that hope a good quarter century into the realm of might-have-beens – and even if the option still existed, the political will to make it happen simply isn’t there. That means that aiming for flexible ad hoc responses cobbled together out of whatever resources come to hand is probably the best option we’ve got. Focusing on those possibilities that can be done on a shoestring, and maximizing the total number of these that get tested in the immediate future, is therefore a crucially important strategy right now. Even if most of those efforts fail, this approach will likely yield the largest number of useful options to mitigate the crisis in the short run and manage some degree of recovery later on.<br><br>This logic has at least one implication that probably won’t sit well with many of my readers: that people should be encouraged to pursue projects that, according to the best current evidence, have little apparent chance of succeeding. That’s a necessary consequence of a dissensus-based approach, though; as Charles Fort used to say, "It is by thinking things that schoolboys know better than to think that discoveries are made." The one caveat that has to be added, though, is that anyone advocating any such project actually needs to be doing something about it.<br><br>The Bussard fusion reactor makes a good example. It’s a modest variation on the Farnsworth fusor, an interesting laboratory curiosity dating from the 1950s;. It’s fairly consistently proven able to fuse small numbers of hydrogen nuclei into helium, but there’s no good reason to think it can produce anything like as much energy as it uses up. For several years now the Bussard reactor has nonetheless been cited over and over again by people on internet forums as a reason not to worry about peak oil – that is, to use a terminology suggested in an earlier post, as a lullaby.<br><br>Still, there are a modest number of people – according to recent media reports, around a dozen – who have built Bussard-style devices in their basements and achieved nuclear fusion, confirmed by neutron detectors. None of them are producing net positive energy at this point, or anything close to it. Still, I have the utmost respect for these people; they’re putting their money, as well as their time and energy, where their mouths are. If there’s any chance that Bussard was right, this is how we’ll find out.<br><br>The flip side of this is simple enough: if people want to come to a peak oil blog (or anywhere else, for that matter) and insist that the Bussard reactor is going to save us all, the appropriate response is, "Are you building one?" If they are, well and good; if they’re chipping in as much as they can afford to help cover the expenses of someone who’s building one, that will pass; otherwise, they’re singing lullabies and may be disregarded.<br><br>The same principle can be applied to any other proposed response to the crisis of industrial society. If it’s viable as a basement-workshop project, then anybody who intends to promote it online or elsewhere had better be building one. If it’s too large, complex, and expensive for a basement workshop, it’s probably going to be too large, complex, and expensive for a civilization caught in the jaws of fossil fuel depletion, climate instability, and economic unraveling. There are some exceptions – again, the rebuilding of America’s rail system comes to mind – but in that case there are still ways to contribute, at least to the extent of the cost of a round trip ticket now and then.<br><br>This is one of the reasons why I’ve limited my focus in these posts on green wizardry to things that I do myself, or have done in the past and am gearing up to do in the future as soon as funds and time permit. The kind of SUV environmentalism that waxes rhapsodic about all the things everybody else ought to do for the environment, while doing few or none of them, is not a viable response to the crisis of our time. I’m willing to open my mouth about energy conservation and organic gardening, appropriate tech and antique tech, doing without and doing with less, because these are things that I do myself; I’d hardly offer myself as any kind of paragon of virtue – there’s much more that I could be doing – but I’m not going to advocate what I’m not willing to do.<br><br>On the other hand, if somebody’s actually out there putting some proposed response to the test, they ought to be given the benefit of the doubt, not to mention the respect due to anybody who’s trying to live up to their aspirations. I would extend that rule very far. The biodynamic agriculture devised most of a century ago by Austrian mystic Rudolf Steiner, for example, combines quite a few very sensible steps – Steiner’s the place where modern organic gardening got the idea of raised beds, for example – with some things, such as planting by astrological influences, that most people reject out of hand these days. I know people who use Steiner’s methods, and they seem to get good results; if planting by the stars and mixing weird herbal concoctions into their compost helps them grow organic food crops and keep people fed during the times to come, more power to ‘em.<br><br>In the weeks to come these posts will be transitioning from food, the first of three themes in the Green Wizard project, to heat, which is the second. While that’s happening, though, I’d like to offer a friendly challenge to my readers, and especially to those of them who are working with green wizardry: choose something improbable that you think might just offer a possible response to any of the aspects of the crisis of industrial society, and get to work on it. If that involves piecing together a Farnsworth fusor in the basement, good; if it involves learning planting by the Moon, good; if it involves – well, whatever it involves, if it appeals to you, get on with it. Don’t leave it to someone else; do it yourself, because that’s the only way it’s going to happen.<br><br>Passion can’t be legislated, and the sort of passion that led, for example, Gregor Mendel to spend years crossing pea plants to tease out the secrets of heredity is what we need right now. At worst, you’ll be able to draw a line under an unhelpful approach so that resources can go elsewhere; at best you may just provide the world with some small but valuable piece of the puzzle of survival. If we’re to reach the future’s further shores with any of the more useful legacies of the last three centuries intact, that willingness to take personal responsibility for making things happen is one of the things we need most right now.

Although I haven't agreed with everything you've said, I can say that you've influenced me quite a bit in the last couple of years from reading your blog and several of your books. In some cases you're writings have caused me to consider ideas I'd never thought of before, in other cases I had some of the same ideas but your perspective articulated them better than I had. So few people really think outside the box of cultural conditioning. For just a couple examples, I'm so sick of those self-proclaimed "skeptics" who have just as set belief system as a baptist preacher, and on the other hand of some new-agey types who won't even put up with any rational analysis of anything.<br><br><a href=#c8820517098896365577 title="comment permalink">12/8/10, 8:44 PM</a><br><br>

I have also observed the posturing for recognition, the usual vanity and much else. For this reason, my regular reading in this arena has pretty much been reduced to The Archdruid Report. To my mind, it is the only voice of sanity and balance left. I read it not so much for advice or because I want to be a "green wizard" (which for the most I already am). I read it as a weekly reprieve from the rest of the insanity that surrounds me.<br><br>But it also seems to me that my distaste for the bickering, which I also encounter in my own small community among the many dedicated "localization" advocates, indicates another more fundamental skill that needs to be added the green wizard's toolbox: the ability to get along with other human beings. This is the problem that I have been working on "in my basement" so-to-speak. If we don't learn how to get along with each other in our real geographically defined communities, I believe we are going to be toast. No set of technical skills is going to make up for that. <br><br>So, here's to encouraging some of you other "inventor" types out there. Maybe you could apply yourselves to this problem - at least, with some of your time and energy. It needs a lot of attention!<br><br>Wishing us all good luck in muddling through this mess!<br><br><a href=#c5756946495702192100 title="comment permalink">12/8/10, 10:19 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avtb a_61c74c" id=c5036991444442688070></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/02333438671130100114 rel=nofollow>Bill Pulliam</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Oy, I just tried to read Brownlee's "Deep Transition" essay... it is utterly hip-deep in newage, and seemingly devoid of any actual well-defined original thoughts, just a mish-mash of stuff that has been percolating for decades (which makes it a perfect mate to permaculture, I suppose!). The almost-incomprehensible Thomas Berry and the slightly-less-incomprehensible Michael Fox may be suitable foundations for a neo-secular-newage-spirituality, but not so much for a redesign of economy and society...<br><br>Here in out own little Tennessee Transition Town I think reality might be starting to settle in on the "green is gold," "financial permaculture" tack the Transition Initiative has taken. A depressed local economy, interestingly, remains just as depressed when you put the word "green" in front of it. The demonstration projects sit there doing not much, their booths at the street fairs are all about trying to sell things to people who don't have jobs. I won't be surprised to see stirrings of an evolution towards other directions. <br><br>What is going to motivate change at the individual and community level here is this local economic reality, not concerns about global phenomena. A flood or a drought may or may not be attributable to rising atmospheric CO2, but it does not make the immediate connection in people's guts: "Dang it's hot this summer. That makes me wanna drive less and ride my bicycle more, and turn my air conditioner off at home!" Not hardly. But energy that is either more expensive or less affordable because of building poverty (or both) makes the direct connection -- "Kids, turn that dang A/C down, we can't afford the electricity! Go ride them bikes down to the creek if y'all are too hot! No you can't take the 4-wheeler, we can't afford the gas for it either!" And these sorts of things will also directly push people towards community changes and responses. People do have an innate desire to help others, and when everyone is having trouble this makes people figure out how help everyone and each other out. This will happen regardless of how the Peak Oil Movement aligns and defines itself. <br><br>Re: The Oil Drum.. indeed I go there for data, analyses, and commentary based around trends, forecasts, and numbers. And I like seeing the "hard numbers" from a variety of directions, including various "informed, reliable, scientific" sources who reach antipodal conclusions. Those of us who have actually been active research scientists understand instinctively that this is where the interesting stuff happens -- in the places where we disagree, concerning the things we do not entirely understand, about which we still don't know much. Established facts are boring. The process of discovering and debating new information is the good stuff! <br><br>I hadn't noticed the comments in the drumbeat about your "branding" (yech). Actually they were nicer to you about that than I would have expected from such a techie and academic crowd, and they seemed quite positively disposed overall to your actual IDEAS. And even if they are going to address it as a "branding" issue, maybe they should look at box office receipts for the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy and the "Harry Potter" sept... er, octology versus those of "An Inconvenient Truth," and then re-evaluate where the minds of the great masses might come down on that issue...<br><br><a href=#c5036991444442688070 title="comment permalink">12/8/10, 10:29 PM</a><br><br>

I have home educated my children for almost 12 years. Our city has a relatively small group of families - over the years it has fluctuated between 80 and 120 families. We need critical mass to get things done but all we have in common is a desire to home educate. Almost everything else is a difference - we go from fundamentalist Christians through to atheists and beyond, we have different goals for our kids, we have different incomes, houses and eating habits but we have do a strong single purpose organisation. <br><br>I would like to share some comments from a parent who after 23 year of home educating gave her farewell to our group.<br><br>"Keep strong to the ideals, hopes and dreams that started you in this road in the first place. Remember that each child is unique - the 'path' and rate of progress will be different for each - try not to compare. Keep on regardless - it IS worth all the 'blood, sweat and tears' because along with these, there will be joys, successes and huge fulfillment. Over the years I have learned that it is important when you step back from<br>an active role in an organization, to take your hands off and not criticize the new ways and directions that emerge from new leadership. This is right<br>and what needs to happen in an organization. I have not been in an active leadership role for a number of years now. As I leave, I would really love to remind you all of a couple of fundamental principles that we had in our minds when we set up the group - and that I am certain are still relevant now. <br><br>We were pioneers and as such we all participated in organising events, our attitude was one of ; "I want this experience for my children, how can I go about setting this up and perhaps sharing it with others" Hold on to this attitude, it is great training for you and a good example for your children. It also spreads the load in the organization. <br>We worked really hard on building up our reputation in the community - with good behaviour, courtesy and manners - showing interest and asking intelligent questions, while in public. Organisations loved having homeschoolers visit because they could count on them being a pleasure to have - this is worth working hard on. We always focused on working together on our common ground. We have always been open to all homeschoolers and as a result, we are a very diverse group. We don't agree on many things and this is fine. But there is always some common ground to focus on and this is where our strength is. This has been a wonderful legacy left to us by our first coordinator. This principle has kept the unity in this sometimes wildly diverse group through the years - please keep hold of this.

I read last weeks comments with people in the US bemoaning fuel prices in excess of US$3.00 per gallon. Over here you'd pay $4.92 per gallon (3.785 litres at AU$1.30 per litre). I've seen prices at around AU$1.50 per litre (that's US$5.67 per gallon), yet we're still here, eating and driving.<br><br>So what are people doing? They're buying smaller vehicles, with smaller more efficient engines. They're also moving to the usage of diesel motors in larger vehicles. The European's have been at this game for longer than we have.<br><br>People are not rioting, they are adapting. Rioting may come later...<br><br>Sadly, few people here would even be aware of the concept of peak oil. It is still very much a fringe concern. That doesn't mean that it isn't happening or won't affect everyone, it's just that a haze of apathy has settled over the land.<br><br>I'm in the process of building an unusual low energy requiring house. It's an experiment, I don't know whether it will work or not, although it appears to be so far. The strange thing about the process is that when I initially sought advice from those who are in the alternative building fields, I was told that it would be a waste of time and materials. I pushed on regardless and am getting closer to completion.<br><br>When I look at a housing estate I wonder how well they'll survive peak oil. Not well I suspect as the houses are designed to be mechanically heated and cooled. I read last week that 70% of houses here have an air conditioning unit. I also read in a separate article that last summer, the electricity grid was at failure point as it had reached the limits of generation capacity.<br><br>Bill is spot on when he writes that it won't be until people can't pay their electricity bill (or don't have supply) that they'll consider doing something different.<br><br>One of the things that I learned from the design and building process is that cultural conditioning is very strong and it takes a great deal of persistence and effort to challenge or overcome - it is not for everybody.<br><br>My prediction is that it won't be until oil supply is drastically reduced or unaffordable that people will change their ways.<br><br>We should stop wasting time on energy sucking arguments, committees, work groups, plans etc. and get on with the task at hand. <br><br>Good luck!<br><br><a href=#c3982752823464818895 title="comment permalink">12/9/10, 3:47 AM</a><br><br>

I've often observed how the virtues of outward dissensus also apply internally. I am a graduate-level scientist and confirmed skeptic, and also a Neo-Pagan practitioner and shaman. There are plenty of inconsistencies between what I "believe" -- what makes rational sense to me -- and what I have experienced and am willing to work with as ad hoc reality in certain aspects of my life and activities. I try not to take either extreme too seriously, and if need be Joseph Campbell or Carl Jung can usually help me find a bridge.<br><br>One of my hats is as host/receptionist/cashier for a booth of tarot and palm readers at a Renaissance festival. Does tarot make rational sense to me? Not particularly, but I recognize the power of looking at things from unorthodox perspectives, and that sometimes, as Fritz Perls said, you have to be out of your mind to come to your senses. I think it's this loose engagement with fluid reality that allows me to sincerely and successfully "sell" divination to both skeptics and believers. I also think, to take up your challenge, I should learn more how to do tarot readings myself.<br><br>Many Rennies, SCAdians, and LARPers can relate to this approach. Rather than an escape from reality, it is a perspective on the multiplicity and complexity of reality, and how to effectively move through it.<br><br><a href=#c6401648676464644128 title="comment permalink">12/9/10, 5:29 AM</a><br><br>

Last week, I put in my resignation at my current place of employment, where I was making use of my B.S. in bioprocess chemical engineering by aiding in the industrial manufacture of clad metal plates used in oil and chemical production infrastructure. As a newly married 27 year old who over the past two years has been becoming fully aware of the various energetic, environmental, and financial limits that our global industrial economy is now bumping up against, and who has cobbled together a home-made nature-based spirituality from my Catholic roots, I faced a maddening cognitive dissonance going to my place of work every day. The feeling here is that whatever talents and skills I may possess would be better suited in working to some way help deal with the change that is coming rather than to help destroy ecosystems and hang on to the last threads of a dying system. <br>I had to put together a 30-slide powerpoint presentation about the limits to growth and sit my parents down in front of the computer to convince them that there is legitimate reason to believe the world is changing, and that leaving my cushy engineering job is not insane - thankfully they came around. So, I’ve got my parents’ 75 acre farm, a strong background in the physical sciences, a library of nearly 50 books about a wide range of topics from natural building techniques to forest gardening and biointensive agriculture, a passion for working outdoors within nature, and a desire to learn about, experiment with, and spread the word about local, ecologically sane, fossil-fuel free, and democratic ways of obtaining life’s necessities. I haven’t the slightest idea where this will take me, or if I’ll make a difference or succeed, but I can say that I’m looking forward to the adventure! <br>So, I’ve already taken up your challenge to walk the talk, and I’m excited to get to work. <br>(NOTE: With having some money in the bank, a wife who holds a teaching job and who understands and shares my passions, and essentially free land, I realize that I’m in a unique position to devote a great deal of my time to this type of work, and I’m extremely grateful.)<br><br><a href=#c6470927155552606771 title="comment permalink">12/9/10, 7:08 AM</a><br><br>

Then I laughed. I think so much of successful adaptation is accepting and embracing change, and worrying too much about one's image gets in the way of that. If we keep thinking and acting the way we always did, the way social forces push us, then how do we change?<br><br>At this point we desperately need to seek other paths and different ideas - not to say we accept them blindly, but rather give them careful consideration. If the idea of reading the thoughts of a Grand Archdruid or sharing ideas with some Green Wizards makes you feel uncomfortable, that is just because society is pulling you back toward that limited range of behaviors and actions that are deemed "acceptable". And down that road is only more of the same.<br><br>I have tried to intentionally cultivate a habit of thinking differently, of living differently (sometimes only in small ways), of being able to give fair hearing to ideas that are not sanctioned by society.

First, your discussion of "men in suits" is of course relevant to all of my friends criticizing Obama from the left because he caved on the tax cut debate. While his spinelessness is evident, I am not so sure he cares about helping the poorest people in America MORE than he wants to get reelected (which seems insanely unlikely today, but I digress). More important is the larger topic: Although I've read your thoughts on dissensus before, I had always couched it (in my mind) in political terms. I was prepared to tell another commenter not to "waste her time" with homeopathy, because my brain rejects it completely. But re-reading your post and seeing YOUR response to her shook me into greater wakefulness. We need dissensus both WITHIN and ACROSS systems. My notions of science, reason, truth, etc. need to be challenged both by others, AND BY ME. So, while there are many reasons to ACT NOW, and stop just talking and talking, one of the reasons is that thinking TOO HARD about what will be more likely to succeed (what is the MOST PRODUCTIVE use of my time?) leads to self-editing, doubt, and paralysis. Scientists told us for years to eat our meat and potatoes, then margarine instead of butter, then to eat bread instead of fat. They were "wrong," but who knows what we'll be told 10 years from now (besides, head for the hills, I mean). Scientific truth has huge value in our world, but it has real limits, and other kinds of truth (spiritual, moral, personal, anecdotal) have to count as well, especially since I am not an expert in all areas of scientific thought, but mainly because scientific "truth" (as opposed to actual truth) got us into this mess, so our trusting it exclusively to get us out of the mess will get us more of the same, and we will deserve it. I keep meaning to get to your book on polytheism (free time is another commodity that would appear to have already "peaked"), as I suspect it would shake me loose from my quasi-religious attachment to the scientific method once and for all. Plus, witnessing you and Sharon Astyk interact playfully is always fun.<br><br><a href=#c6423161695891234349 title="comment permalink">12/9/10, 8:26 AM</a><br><br>

Herewith a riff:<br><br>Having never been able to join movements, and having difficulty thinking in categories, because more of a "weaver," or associative thinker, I tend to think of our predicament in terms of "all of the above." Peak oil/climate change/biodiversity loss/overpopulation are interrelated parts of a whole (duh!), so I read around, widely, and try to understand different modes of thought and worldviews--official and non-official. So much is about competing views of reality--a bunch of blind persons touching different parts of an elephant.<br><br>Educating oneself, pursuing green wizardry projects, reducing one's own carbon footprint, getting to know neighbors, forming a strong social network--these together work on everything at once. <br><br>Of course, if we lived with proper attention to what our role should be as part of the biotic community, "all of the above" wouldn't be so much of a problem. So it's being forced on us, or will be. <br><br>Haven't read Brownlee. Don't have much patience with ideological arguments. Don't know much about Druidry and will look it up.<br><br>For me as a Quaker, the question of how one lives, or how one should live in relation to the material world inevitably takes on a spiritual/ethical/philosophical dimension. Friends have a long history of accomplishing things from outside the mainstream--which isn't to say we haven't got our own mainstream and also conflicts, being human and living in the world as we do.<br><br>There continues for me a strong feeling of existing in several realities simultaneously. For example, sometimes I'll see an ad for a car, or hear on the news that--yay!--car sales are up, or hear people discussing the relative merits of various car brands...oh no, I'm behind the looking glass again.<br><br>As Czeslaw Milosz wrote at the end of "A Song on the End of the World,"<br><br>"...As long as the sun and the moon are above,<br>As long as the bumblebee visits a rose,<br>As long as rosy infants are born<br>No one believes it is happening now.<br><br>Only a white-haired old man, who would be a prophet<br>Yet is not a prophet, for he’s much too busy,<br>Repeats while he binds his tomatoes:<br>There will be no other end of the world,<br>There will be no other end of the world."<br><br>I sometimes use this poem in class when discussing climate change and peak oil. <br><br>Hope this isn't too long.<br><br><a href=#c2615611132637720317 title="comment permalink">12/9/10, 8:47 AM</a><br><br>

It occurs to me that many of us today are singing "lullabies" in that regard, and "living on the internet" as a "ritual" to avoid that fact, in much the same way as we use hybrid cars as a ritual to reassure ourselves that we're saving the world. Many of us want to believe that we can have a perfect community, and only associate with people who are like us, and think we can do it by spending our time in a virtual community.<br><br>Much as it would be fun to fantasize about living in a beautiful village powered by sustainable agriculture and populated only with the regular readers of this blog, its not going to happen, and even then we wouldn't all get along. I can't resist quoting Wendell Berry from a 1973 interview in Mother Earth News. When asked why he decided to move back to his small hometown, and how he decided it was a suitable community, this was his response: "...no community is suitable. There's plenty wrong with them all. I could construct an airtight argument for not settling in my own community. [But] the fact is that I'm spending my life constructing an argument for being here."<br><br>Again and again, it keeps coming back to the same fundamental reality--peak oil and its associated problems aren't technical in nature, they're cultural. Gandhi said the earth has enough for man's need, but not for man's greed. What more needs to be said?<br><br><a href=#c1493469317693751055 title="comment permalink">12/9/10, 10:05 AM</a><br><br>

Two notes struck me: it is valuable to get along in one's community. That doesn't mean unanimity about the situation, but gathering into small-like minded enclaves tends to close out new ideas and even encourage violence. Counter-vailing opinions help me clarify my own thinking, even when it doesn't change my conclusion, and they avoid a self-reinforcing eventually bitter cycle of resentment and exclusiveness. <br><br>The trash truck driver was at my door, angry this morning. I had called asking why the trash had not been picked up in about six weeks, and he complained that the bin wasn't [quite] full, and that it's inconvenient to drive out here to pick it up. Angry because I had asked why I was paying for non-existent pickup. I was angry in return, which is not constructive. I'd like peace, even with people with whom I don't agree. Can't always get it, but my anger doesn't make it better. I'd have done better to listen empathically.<br><br>I agree that we can't ally effectively with the Climate Change movement, and that they have been terribly ineffective in spite of solid science. Science is misunderstood (doesn't science produce iPad's?) and not believed by our uneducated American public.

The only reason so many people compare leadership in the alternative scene to herding cats is that they haven't learned how you herd cats. <br><br>How do you herd cats? You get to the place you want them to go, carrying an electric can opener and a #10 can of tuna. Once the sound of the can opener is heard and the odor of tuna spreads, you'll have your herd of cats right where you want them -- but that presupposes that you're willing to go there first and deliver the goods, which is of course what a lot of would-be leaders aren't willing to do...<br><br>Jason, excellent! I wonder if it's occurred to you, though, that one of the reasons I chose the hokey term is precisely because it's too hokey to make a respectable slogan, and so will force people who wand a respectable slogan to coin one of their own. Dissensus...<br><br>Jim, excellent. Unlike most skeptics, you've grasped that the questions "does X occur" and "why does X occur" are of different logical types, and that it's a fallacy to insist, as so many people do these days, that if the cause isn't known, the effect didn't happen!

I'd encourage everyone to copy down the mailing address of the <a href=http://www.culturalconservers.org rel=nofollow>Cultural Conservers Foundation</a> -- POB 914, Cumberland MD 21501 -- which will be the contact point for post-internet Green Wizardry, at least to start with; that way if the net goes down unexpectedly, we've got a fallback.

I'm reminded of the quote from Marshal Lyautey; when he instructed his gardener to put in a row of oaks along one of the drives on his estate, and the gardener reminded him that the oaks would take 200 years to reach maturity, the marshal said, "Then there is no time to waste; you must plant them this very afternoon." <br><br>Lorax, you're in an excellent position to get some serious work done.

There's plenty of weirdness to look into; a fair amount of it is almost certainly crap, but it's nearly impossible to figure out which is the good stuff without putting it to the test. That's why I recommend the utterly unscientific approach of looking for something that ignites your interest and your passion, and going at it whole hog. <br><br>Bob, excellent. I certainly don't want to dissuade you from looking at the world according to the views of scientific materialism; that's also a piece in the puzzle, and the sciences themselves teach crucial skills that can be of use in a very wide (though of course not limitless) range of endeavors. Still, it's worth remembering -- as you point out -- that scientific notions change constantly, and the established truth of one decade fairly often becomes the outworn dogma of the next; it's also worth remembering, as I suggested to Jim above, that a phenomenon can occur even if the traditional folk theories concerning its causes don't happen to be accurate. <br><br>Adrian, I hear from a lot of people who are having the experience of inhabiting a couple of parallel worlds right now -- hard to avoid when so many people are living in what amounts to la-la land right now.

I did want to challenge one of your ideas, here, though. I agree that an "alliance" between Peak Oildom and the climate change camp wouldn't work for various reasons. But I think the Peak Oil Community ignores them at their own peril. I think the Peak Oil people are primed to make exactly the same mistakes that the global warming people did. They are putting a lot of stock in the fact that they are right and all the facts align in their favor, and now that those facts are fully "public" and incontrovertible the powers that be will have to deal with it. I think they even expect to get some credit for being ahead of the curve on things, and maybe even be granted some influence on ways forward! Yes, the Climate Change people failed (with all those same "advantages" listed above), but now there is a set of scientist-activists that have come out of that crucible who are far more sophisticated about what it means to contradict the fossil fuel status quo. I think they can be a crucial resource if the kind of thinking that underlay the Peak Oil movement is going to have its say.<br><br><a href=#c6637979332513584962 title="comment permalink">12/9/10, 11:43 AM</a><br><br>

That puts it within one's reach. <br><br>It seems to me you're proposing quite a different sort of activity than hitherto. As best I recall, your prior suggestions generally involve individuals mastering proven, tried-and-true traditional crafts or skills that will enable them to survive economic collapse: gardening, carpentry, leather working, and so forth. But building reactors in one's basement or working on other experimental responses to energy shortage is not the sort of activity that guarantees survival to the one doing it. It's a long shot which, if successful, will benefit a local community or even society at large, but if it fails will have cost someone dear to no purpose from their point of view, other than the process of elimination of potential solutions that you have indicated. <br><br>Even if pursued by a group of people pooling their means, it implies a substantial surplus of time and resources beyond what is needed for mere survival, the sort of surplus that is likely to become ever scarcer as economies contract. So if people want grand solutions, or even modest ones, time would seem to be a critical factor: as you've reminded us often before, of course. <br><br>In the movie "What the Bleep" a string theory / membrane physicist <br>rhetorically poses the question "Can you build a universe in your basement?" His answer is that given the proper conditions Yes, you can. This may be encouraging to those back yard tinkers engaged in constructing Bussard reactors or other somewhat less ambitious tasks.

If you look at housing estates they are designed to isolate the individuals and families. Look at the fences between neighbours, people not knowing (or talking to) their neighbours, people working long distances from their place of residence. You could go on, but it simply lacks social cohesion.<br><br>The majority of people must like it this way though as it is quite a common way to live in Western society. People see their neighbours as an intrusion into their quiet enjoyment.<br><br>Yet, such a divided community has no voice. It's an old tactic to promote division as people become more easily manipulated and controlled. It's the downfall of committees and community groups too. <br><br>It's easily done through a consumer culture because you're busy collecting stuff, showing it off and hoarding it. These actions do not promote a culture of community cohesion.<br><br>Should Western society break down, the majority of our housing stock will be useless and most likely recycled by enterprising individuals or groups. Something approximating a village or small town will be a viable community. You'll have no choice but to get to know your neighbours and learn to get along with them.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><a href=#c8187497444019902266 title="comment permalink">12/9/10, 11:29 PM</a><br><br>

Unlike some here, I think the term "Green Wizzard" is great. It's more positive than "Grim Wise Man", and lends appropriate trappings to what is, when stripped bare, very much the technical process of weaning ourselves, our culture, from the empty rewards of technological complexity.<br><br>As a former deepwater sailor, it occured to me that sailors always give names to their ships, always refer to them as "Her", "She", and having endured more than a few awsome storms at sea I understand why. While a boat is merely a technological construct, when built and well crewed, a ship becomes a living entity that cannot survive the storm without the capable, and indeed caring handling of Her crew. She is the only thing between them and a watery grave. Therefore, She must have a name.<br><br>There was a time when rail locomotives were works of art as well as engineering marvels. Their builders and engineers gave them names as well.<br><br>My woodstove is an hierloom, beautiful soapstone, and has warmed my family for decades. It occurs to me that it should have a name. "Greer" perhaps ;-)<br><br>My point is that we are long past the point where we take our most critical technology for granted. We use it up then throw it away. Our relationship to all of our resources has become sterile. I posted on TOD a few months ago that, by the time it heats my house, I have handled each piece of firewood at least six times. I often think of the tree it came from as I load my little cart with wood on cold winter evenings. Each bit of wood is placed carefully into the stove (Greer?) with a bit of reverence. This connection to the warmth provided, what is technically a source of fuel, has importance. When these things become only a check to be written, a barrel of oil or a kilowatt of electriciy from far away, they become neccessary evils; little more. This is the "inappropriate" result of the sterile relationship we have developed with the gifts that Mother Earth has provided. As it always has, history is witnessing the consequences.<br><br>....so JMG, thanks for providing context, the sort of trappings we will need to reconnect with what matters. Only when we begin to tell better stories and give better names to all things that sustain us will we become a capable crew for Spaceship Earth.<br><br><a href=#c2112591014269490810 title="comment permalink">12/10/10, 7:38 AM</a><br><br>

There is plenty of disagreement within the climate scientists themselves about all the effects of climate change, one example is James Hansen saying the IPCC estimate of sea level rise is much too low. The arctic sea ice has been melting faster than the models predicted a few years ago.<br><br>I tend to put more stake in paleoclimate findings as they're at least a state that the climate has been in before and not just a theoretical state. However even they are not a guarantee of what will happen this time, and the transition period that has stared and will last until the climate eventually settles into a new semi-stable state (likely past the lifespan of anyone now) is likely the trickiest of all to predict. While I am pretty convinced of certain things, such as the Earth as a whole getting warmer (although it's possible that changes in weather patterns could cool certain areas), downpours getting heavier, and the sea level rising, but even these it's very unclear how they'll turn out and what unexpected outcomes could happen.<br><br>It seems many in the climate change movement want to convince people they're pretty sure of the outcome because admitting uncertainty in they're view gives credence to the deniers.

Over the 20th Century people became more dependent on their employers and less dependent on their physical neighbors and local community, hence social isolation grew. It's not that people necessarily WANT to know and be known by all their neighbors, but under most circumstances, where the nuclear household is simply not viable, you HAVE to know and be known by your neighbors and community whether you like it or not. Hence the construction of all these social conventions that defuse, bury, and isolate tensions so peace can be maintained and work can get done. I know all my neighbors, they all know me, we all know each others business. I actually rather dislike one of them, and I suspect he outright hates me. But we get along. It's an inevitability when your life is lived close to home rather than in some separate urban economic hub. <br><br>Like so many things, it matters not one bit whether people WANT to know and learn to get along with their neighbors and local community. It's just like people who say "Ew, all that sweaty dirty manual labor doesn't sound like fun, I wouldn't enjoy that at all." So what?

Along those lines, the Royal Society (the world's oldest scientific body) recently published a special issue on "4 Degrees [Celsius] and Beyond", which was all about the likelihood (great) of 4C+ climate change, and its impacts. They also found that, under business-as-usual, that level of warming was likely as soon as 2060.

Thank you. <br><br>Planner, paleoclimatic data suggest that climate feedback loops routinely drive sudden, drastic changes in temperature -- check out the beginning and end of the Younger Dryas phase at the end of the last ice age around 11,500 BCE, when global temperatures dropped 15 degrees F. in less than a decade, stayed in the deep freeze for a thousand years, then slammed back up even further in another decade or so and launched the great melting of the continental glaciers. <br><br>Hit modern industrial civilization with a 15 degree F. change and its consequences, and it will collapse like a punctured whoopee cushion -- but you'll notice that the biosphere shed some megafauna, regrouped, and went chugging right along.

This is a very important lesson -- some regions can see much more drastic change and even in different directions. Last winter with the Arctic Dipole Anomaly (wiki it for details) was rather similar to the Dryas pattern - sudden dramatic cold focused on eastern North America and western Europe, triggered by a new atmospheric circulation pattern never before seen in the historical record. Meanwhile the rest of the globe remained hot and getting hotter. <br><br>The biosphere as a whole survives rapid climate change, but many individual pieces of it do not. In the "punctuated equilibrium" concept of evolution, long periods of relative stability are separated by short periods of rapid change. In these "punctuations" both evolution and extinction get kicked into high gear -- some things go extinct, others change and diversify rapidly, setting the evolution of new species in motion. Rapid climate changes are some of these punctuation events.<br><br><a href=#c6939881388786281483 title="comment permalink">12/11/10, 5:14 AM</a><br><br>

The Peak Oil Movement is full of people who believe that wealth comes from resources, not production. Its a belief that lost ground in the outcome of the civil war. I understand what you are saying regarding the politics behind TOD's distancing from you- however, I have to say that while I highly respect your intelligence, your ability to write, your critical analysis skills, and your insight, I think your premise is that without the resource of oil, we have no wealth. I've rad your past posts on the guy falling to an island with millions in his brief case and heard you ask the question, Where is his wealth now? As long as the people within the Peak Oil movement subscribe to this rhetoric, they will always be without much effect. Whether you like it or not, the people making decisions don't frame the problem of oil in the context of the isolated desert island scenario. They frame it in a scenario that looks at what is available around us and asks, how can human ingenuity process these resources to meet our needs. The needs aren't questioned because they are perceived as real. And as long as you don't perceive them as real yourself, the impact that you have will be severely limited (which is essentially your position, right? Don't find something else to take oils place, change your lifestyle and reduce your material needs.

First, describing climate modeling as "guessing" is totally incorrect. Granted that scientists don't know close to everything about natural law, but they know a heck of a lot more than the average Joe -- so they're making educated guesses ;-). Which is definitely different. Climate models are based on our most current understanding about how the monstrously complex climate system works.

I can think of many more enjoyable ways to spend one's time than sitting in artificially-lit rooms staring at computer monitors and trying to figure out just how much we've screwed up our environment. Not to mention being called before Congressional nincompoops every few months. Furthermore, and by way of example, the whole IPCC process is run by volunteers.

It doesn't matter that the dinosaurs lived in a much hotter climate. <i>We</i>, and every other species presently alive, are adapted to the climate of today. The rate of change of temperature is currently something like +0.2C per decade, which is around 10x faster than the rate at which most species can adapt. So, <i>most species</i> will go extinct under business-as-usual. And, in fact, it is widely recognized that we are in the midst of a mass extinction. In a few million years, I've no doubt that new species will evolve in concert with whatever climate exists then. But that is irrelevant.<br><br>Regarding water vapor as the primary greenhouse gas, it is true that H2O is much more powerful than CO2, but CO2 is still the "control knob" of the climate, as <a href=http://climateprogress.org/2010/10/18/carbon-dioxide-thermostat-controls-earth-temperature/ rel=nofollow>this paper</a> discusses. H2O is highly variable year-to-year (not to mention day-to-day), while CO2 can persist in the atmosphere for thousands of years. To quote from that article:<br><br><i>CO2 is the key atmospheric gas that exerts principal control (80% of the non-condensing GHG forcing) over the strength of the terrestrial greenhouse effect.

What I reconstruct from his essay is that he and his little cohort based on a farm in New Jersey have knitted together Thomas Berry's Great Work, Brian Swimme's Universe Story, ecopsychology, and several other influences and come up with something that is, in all but name, a religion. Brownlee is a convert to that religion, a True Believer, with all a convert's zeal, and he really thinks that this new not-a-religion will reach people that Transition and Green Wizardry and Orlov's New Age of Sail and all the rest have not, because it will give them a spiritual high better than the high they get from either the Abrahamic myth of being created to "be fruitful and multiply, fill the earth and conquer it" or the secular myth of Progress. Maybe he's right but, to me, the whole thing smells a little too much of Unitarian Jihad to have really broad appeal.

Speaking as someone who’s been gardening for the past two decades and is presently being humbled by the new soil/microclimate I’ve moved to, I think urgency and 10 years-still-networked isn’t a contradiction. <br><br>Also, I’d like to stick my two cents in about Nonviolent Communication (NVC) – while I agree with the theory that finger pointing doesn’t work as well as speaking more gently about one’s own experience &amp; perception, I strongly disagree with the statement of the founder that this method works “on everyone”. I have had many experiences, using and watching NVC being tried on narcissists and those who are in fact not being truthful – it will not work on such people! (As I wrote somewhere else – imagine using NVC on some of our more egregious politicians and pundits – I self-censored on who I had in mind). The point being that if people want to understand each other and come to some shared perspectives, and are willing to be honest, then NVC can help lower the emotional charge to enable discussion. But if someone lacks empathy or is deliberately deceitful, what is the point of telling them “When you do X, I feel Y”? They don’t give a *darn*! And also, most of the discussion on this blog would be “ruled out” by NVC rules… apparently the stating of facts have to be couched by the statement that it is simply your perspective… and as a strong believer in data, I reject that requirement. So anyway, it’s something to be aware of.<br><br><a href=#c8719862286876171016 title="comment permalink">12/14/10, 4:34 PM</a><br><br>

There's a difference, though, between the science and the advocacy that's grown up around it; the advocacy has been so inept, and so readily defeated, that the peak oil movement would be wise to keep its distance. <br><br>By the way, the ice age tipping point isn't an internet meme; I read about it in some detail in the late 1970s. The global climate is unstable in both directions, after all. <br><br>Gsanford, by all means follow your own dissensus! I may (and do) disagree, but Voltaire's comment remains apropos: "I disagree with what you say but will defend to the death your right to say it." <br><br>Bill, that seems like a fair assessment, especially when it's remembered that to produce a proxy reading in the 15 degrees F. range, while the southern hemisphere was apparently stable, the temperature drop in the North Atlantic region must have been phenomenal. An equivalent event now would be an unparalleled cataclysm. <br><br>Sofistek, journals were being printed here in North America 250 years ago, at a time when a well-made oxcart counted as advanced transportation technology. Ten years from now, we're not going to be working with a pre-1760 technological basis, and there will still be a point to publishing facts and figures -- thus my suggestion about the future of TOD. <br><br>Zach, that's the one. I don't know the specific source; White's Law, which is what the principle was called, was much discussed when I was taking classes at the Huxley College of Environmental Studies in Bellingham, WA back in the very early 1980s. <br><br>Sofistek, there are surveys, and there's also the interesting point that the number of office visits each year to alternative medical practitioners in the US is significantly greater than the number of visits to practitioners of scientific medicine -- this even though alternative health care is pretty thoroughly persecuted in the US these days. As for the Younger Dryas, I'm not saying an equivalent crisis won't be a problem -- quite the contrary; I'm just pointing out that the biosphere will get through it just fine. <br><br>Joan, well, you put things a bit more strongly than I would, but I'm not at all inclined to disagree in terms of content. <br><br>Sophie, you don't sound nuts at all. Might be worth researching some of the ways that letters were used to connect groups of people in pre-internet times. <br><br>Cathy, that's fascinating. I've never really looked into NVC or its various equivalents -- I have a deep-seated dislike for attempts to restructure the organic process of human language in the service of some set of abstract ideals -- but your analysis certainly makes sense of some of the more unproductive features of the cant current in today's progressive scene.<br><br>Ric, thanks for the link!<br><br>Youth, no kidding.

I remember reading something in the early 90's to the effect that the climatic state of the last couple million years or so (sorry I don't have precise numbers; could be off by a lot), that is the oscillation of glacial and interglacial periods, is a result of plate tectonics. To wit, the current location of Antarctica straddling the South Pole, and her separation from South America, allowed a novel and very strong South Circumpolar Current, which has many major influences on global ocean circulation and also allows the massive accumulation of continental ice. The melting or breaking of this ice would also have major effects, most obviously a dramatic sea-level rise. I don't remember all the feedback mechanisms, but it did talk about possible tipping point scenarios related to the Antarctic ice and to the circumpolar current.
