These days, the news coming out of America’s political and financial centers evokes the same sort of horrified fascination that draws onlookers to the scene of any other catastrophe. Investors spooked by the Fed’s willingness to pay for deficit spending by printing money are backing away from US debt, and the interest the US government has to pay on its bonds has accordingly gone up, gaining a full percentage point in the last month and putting pressure on other interest rates across the board. <p></p> <p class=MsoNormal> </p> <p class=MsoNormal>In the teeth of this stinging vote of no confidence from the bond market, the Obama administration and its Republican allies in Congress – chew on that concept for a moment – are pushing through another round of spending increases and tax cuts that the government doesn’t have the money to pay for.<span style=""> </span>The ratings agency Moody’s has warned that if the current spending bill is passed, it will have to consider downgrading the once-sacrosanct AAA rating on US government debt.<span style=""> </span>Exactly how the endgame is going to be played is still anybody’s guess – runaway stagflation, a hyperinflationary currency collapse, and a flat-out default by the US government on its gargantuan public debt are all possible – but there’s no way that it’s going to end well. </p> <p class=MsoNormal> </p> <p class=MsoNormal>All this makes the topic of this week’s post particularly timely.<span style=""> </span>Across the industrial world, people have come to assume that they ought to be able to buy ripe strawberries in December and fresh oysters in May, and more generally food in vast quantity and variety on demand, irrespective of season. That assumption relies on using wildly extravagant amounts of energy to ship and process foodstuffs, and that by itself renders the eating habits of the recent past an arrangement without a future, but these same habits also depend on a baroque global financial system founded on the US dollar. As that comes unraveled, an old necessity most of our grandmothers grew up with – home processing and storage of seasonal foods – will become necessary once again, at least for those who don’t find scurvy and other dietary deficiency diseases to their taste. </p> <p class=MsoNormal> </p> <p class=MsoNormal>Food storage is a subject that calls up strong and often contradictory emotions, and sometimes inspires actions that don’t necessarily make much sense.<span style=""> </span>Rumors are flying just now in some corners of the peak oil community, for example, that the sales freeze-dried food has spiked so sharply in recent months that suppliers are unable to keep up with the demand.<span style=""> </span>This may well be true, but if so, it shows a certain lack of common sense; unless you plan on living out of a backpack during a financial crash – and this is arguably not a good idea – there are many better and cheaper ways to make sure you have some food put by to cope with breaks in the supply chain. </p> <p class=MsoNormal> </p> <p class=MsoNormal>Nor is food storage really about stashing food in a cellar in order to ride out a crisis.<span style=""> </span>A century ago, nearly everybody in America processed food at home for storage if they could possibly do so, for reasons much more down to earth than expectations of catastrophe.<span style=""> </span>They did it primarily because the foods available year round in a temperate climate typically don’t provide a balanced diet, much less an inviting one.<span style=""> </span>Absent the energy and financial systems that make it look reasonable to fly fresh food from around the world to stock supermarkets in the United States throughout the year, good sources of vitamin C are mostly to be had in the summer and fall, meat tends to show up in a lump at slaughtering time in October and November, and so on; if you want these things the rest of the year, and you don’t have a functioning industrial economy to take care of that matter for you, you learn how to prepare foods for storage in season, and keep them safely stored until wanted later on. </p> <p class=MsoNormal> </p> <p class=MsoNormal>The ways that this can be done, interestingly enough, make a very good lesson in practical ecology.<span style=""> </span>To keep food in edible condition, you have to engage in what ecologists call competitive exclusion – that is, you have to prevent other living things from eating it before you do.<span style=""> </span>Your main competitors are bacteria and other microorganisms, and you exclude them by changing the habitat provided by the food until it no longer provides the competition with the resources it needs to survive. </p> <p class=MsoNormal> </p> <p class=MsoNormal>You can do that by changing just about every ecological variable you can think of. You can make food too cold for bacteria to survive; that’s freezing.<span style=""> </span>You can make food too hot, and keep it enclosed in a container that won’t let the bacteria back in when the food cools down; that’s canning. You can make food too dry; that’s drying.<span style=""> </span>You can change the chemical balance of food to make it indigestible to bacteria, but not to you; that’s salting, brining, smoking, corning, and pickling, among other things.<span style=""> </span>You can get sneaky and keep food alive, so that its own immune system will prevent bacteria from getting a foothold; that’s root cellaring, and a variety of other tricks commonly used with cold-hardy vegetables.<span style=""> </span>Alternatively, you can get even sneakier and beat the bacteria to the punch by deliberately infecting food with a microorganism of your choice, which will crowd out other microbes and change the food in ways that will leave it in edible condition for you; that’s fermentation.<span style=""> </span></p> <p class=MsoNormal> </p> <p class=MsoNormal>Which of these is the best option?<span style=""> </span>Wrong question.<span style=""> </span>Depending on where you are, what foodstuffs and other resources you have to hand, and how long you expect it to take for various parts of the current order of things to come unraveled, almost any mix of options might be a good choice.<span style=""> </span>It will almost certainly have to be a mix, since no one preservation method works best for everything, and in many cases there’s one or another method that’s the best or only option. </p> <p class=MsoNormal> </p> <p class=MsoNormal>It’s also wise to have a mix, because methods of preserving food differ among themselves in another way:<span style=""> </span>some are much more functional in a time of energy shortages than others.<span style=""> </span>If your food storage plans revolve around having a working freezer, you had better hope that the electricity remains on in the area where you live, or you need to make sure you have a backup that will function over the long term – and no, a diesel generator in the basement and a tank of fuel doesn’t count, not after the first few weeks of fuel shortage.<span style=""> </span>That doesn’t mean that blanching and freezing some of your homegrown garden produce is a bad idea; it means you need to have something in place to power the freezer well before the brownouts start to happen, or you need to be prepared to shift to another preservation method in a hurry, or both. </p> <p class=MsoNormal> </p> <p class=MsoNormal>This points to a second good lesson in practical ecology that can be learned from food storage, though this one’s a lesson in practical <i>human</i> ecology.<span style=""> </span>Technologies – all technologies, everywhere – vary in their dependence on larger systems.<span style=""> </span>When comparing two technologies that do the same thing, the impact of their relative dependence on different systems needs to be included in the comparison; if technology A and B both provide a given service, and technology A is cheaper, easier, and more effective than technology B under ordinary conditions, technology B can still be the wiser choice if technology A is wholly dependent on an unstable system while technology B lacks that vulnerability. </p> <p class=MsoNormal> </p> <p class=MsoNormal>This much should be obvious, though all too often it isn’t.<span style=""> </span>It’s embarrassing, in point of fact, to see how often a brittle, complex and vulnerable technology dependent on highly questionable systems is touted as “more efficient” than some simpler, more reliable and more independent equivalent, simply because the former works somewhat better on those occasions when it can be made to work at all. Just as you don’t actually know how to use a tool until you can instantly name three ways to misuse it and three things it can’t do at all, it’s a waste of time and resources to buy into any technology unless you have a pretty good idea in advance of its vulnerabilities and the ways it tends to fail.</p> <p class=MsoNormal> </p> <p class=MsoNormal>This sort of thinking can and should be applied throughout the green wizardry we’ve been discussing in the last five months or so of posts, but food storage is a very good place to start.<span style=""> </span>Let’s say you’ve decided to blanch and freeze some of the vegetables from your backyard garden.<span style=""> </span>That can be a good choice, at least if you can expect your electricity supply to remain stable for the next year or two; still, you owe it to yourself and your freezer bags of Romano beans to take a moment to work out the downside. What are the main sources of electricity in your service area, and how will they be affected by likely changes in fossil fuel prices over the next couple of years?<span style=""> </span>How does electricity get to you from the grid, and is that connection vulnerable?<span style=""> </span>When does your service area tend to suffer blackouts, and how long do they tend to last?<span style=""> </span>Are there ways you can keep a freezer powered for the duration of a longer than average blackout?<span style=""> </span>Does one of those ways seem like a sensible investment, or would it be smarter to shift to a less vulnerable method of storage? </p> <p class=MsoNormal> </p> <p class=MsoNormal>More complexities slip in when you remember that there’s often more than one way to power the same process.<span style=""> </span>You can dry food, for example, in an electric dehydrator, but in any climate that isn’t too humid, you can also dry food in a solar dehydrator.<span style=""> </span>This is basically a black box with small holes in the top and bottom, covered with fine mesh to keep out insects, and trays of screen-door screening stretched on wooden frames inside, with the food spaced on the trays to allow air circulation.<span style=""> </span>The sun heats the box, air flows in through the bottom and carries moisture away through the top, and the food dries with no other source of power.<span style=""> </span>When you’ve got adequate and reliable electricity, an electric dehydrator is more convenient and reliable; when you have reason to think that electricity will be expensive, intermittent, or not available at all, the solar dehydrator is usually the better plan. </p> <p class=MsoNormal> </p> <p class=MsoNormal>In many cases like this last, though, the best option of all is to have and use both – the more convenient and reliable technology while you’re still on the learning curve and the larger system that supports it is still there; the more resilient and independent system in a small way all along, so that you learn its quirks and can shift over to it full time once the more complex technology becomes nonfunctional. In the same way, it can make a good deal of sense to blanch and freeze garden produce while you’re still learning your way around using home-dried foods, or to can your pickles in a hot water bath while you’re still getting the knack of older pickling methods that don’t require airtight containers.</p> <p class=MsoNormal> </p> <p class=MsoNormal>In a time of faltering energy supplies – not to mention the spectacular self-destruction of national finances – this sort of thinking can be applied very broadly indeed.<span style=""> </span>The strategy of a staged disconnection from failing technologies, made on the basis of local conditions and personal, family, and community needs, offers a pragmatic alternative to the forced choice between total dependence on a crumbling industrial system, on the one hand, or the usually unreachable ideal of complete personal or community independence on the other.<span style=""> </span>The backyard-garden methods discussed in earlier posts are founded on that strategy, and most of the energy conservation and homescale renewable energy production methods that will be central to the first few months’ worth of posts next year rely on it as well.<span style=""> </span></p> <p class=MsoNormal> </p> <p class=MsoNormal>There’s a reason for this ubiquity:<span style=""> </span>the strategy of staged disconnection is the constructive alternative to catabolic collapse.<span style=""> </span>A society in catabolic collapse, running short of necessary resources, cannibalizes its own productive assets to replace resource flows, and ends up consuming itself.<span style=""> </span>The strategy of staged disconnection is not catabolic but metabolic; it taps into existing resource flows <i>before</i> shortages become severe, and uses them to bridge the gap between existing systems that are likely to fail and enduring systems that have not yet been built. At the same time, if it’s done right, it doesn’t draw heavily enough on existing systems to cause them to fail before they have to. </p> <p class=MsoNormal> </p> <p class=MsoNormal>That’s what could have happened if the industrial world had pursued the promising initiatives of the 1970s, instead of taking a thirty-year vacation from reality that cost us the chance of a smooth transition to a sustainable future.<span style=""> </span>On the collective scale, that’s water under the bridge at this point, but it can still be done on the smaller scale of individuals, families, and communities. </p> <p class=MsoNormal> </p> <p class=MsoNormal><span style=font-size:130%>Resources</span></p> <p class=MsoNormal> </p> <p class=MsoNormal>Food preservation and storage are among the few subsets of green wizardry where old information can land you in a world of hurt.<span style=""> </span>If you intend to take up canning, in particular, you need up-to-date information; for example, the relative proportions of sugar and acid in today’s tomato varieties, as compared to those fifty years ago, are so different that recipes that were safe then can land you with botulism poisoning, i.e., quite possibly dead, if you use them today.<span style=""> </span>Your county extension service can point you toward accurate information on safe canning, and so can the current edition of the Ball <i>Blue Book</i><span style="font-style: normal">. </span></p> <p class=MsoNormal> </p> <span style=';font-family:";font-size:100%'>Not all methods of food preservation are as volatile as canning.<span style=""> </span>Though it’s always wise to check for updated information, some of the classics are still well worth reading.<span style=""> </span>My library includes Mike and Nancy Bubel’s <i>Root Cellaring</i>, Grace Firth’s <i>Stillroom Cookery</i>, Phyllis Hobson’s <i>Making and Using Dried Foods</i>, Carol Hupping’s <i>Stocking Up III</i>,<span style=""> </span>and Stanley Schuler and Elizabeth Meriwether Schuler’s <i>Preserving the Fruits of the Earth</i>. </span>

Thank you.<br><br>Please shoot a few hole through my thinking here. I have lived off grid for over 8 years utilizing a small solar array, a 1000w. wind generator, and a small battery bank. The energy mainly runs a refrigerator and an Envirolet composting toilet, along with assorted compact fluorescents, a laptop, etc. I make more energy than I consume and could charge the batteries of an electric vehicle to get myself around over short distances. If I shift to an outhouse (which I already have) and add a freezer, I would not alter the energy use pattern. I have a propane backup generator for the winter doldrums (fog and no wind), and so can skate through those times<br><br>I know that the batteries and the propane are the weak links over time. I can manufacture methane in a digester to replace the propane, but would need a compressor to put the methane under pressure, but with excess electricity, I don't see that being a problem.

What counts as "ordinary" these days is the wildly non-ordinary situation of vast amounts of cheap abundant energy; when that goes away, and of course it's going right now, "ordinary" changes for keeps. <br><br>Hal, excellent! A solar dryer might be a good next step, if you don't have one already; that way you can dry things in the summer, when you probably don't want to be heating up the kitchen but some of the best vegetables for drying are in season.<br><br><a href=two-lessons-in-practical-ecology.html#c5888176939758292056 title="comment permalink">12/15/10, 10:11 PM</a><br><br>

It is a reasonable action to take during precarious economic times. When I have the money to buy certain items in bulk (beans and rice, for example), I buy 100-200 pounds and repackage. <br>Easiest and most economical way to repackage:<br>2 liter bottles<br>Scald out bottles and let them dry completely.<br>Get some bay leaves and put a couple in each bottle (one in the bottom and one on top after filling). Get an appropriate sized funnel and fill those bottles with rice or beans and put the cap on tight. Store in a closet, a pantry, under your bed, where ever.<br>I also dehydrate foods (many of which can be stored in 2 liter bottles with O2 absorbers and bay leaves), I can foods, I use lacto-fermentation...right now have a couple of gallons of kimchi bubbling away in the pantry. I root cellar as well.<br>So many ways to store away food for future use! <br>With the economy the way it is right now, EVERYONE should have 3 months worth of food storage---just in case!<br><br><a href=two-lessons-in-practical-ecology.html#c4303330136008657774 title="comment permalink">12/16/10, 1:15 AM</a><br><br>

I wouldn't want to ship them around the world though as I pick them too ripe for flavour, unlike most fruit these days and as such they wouldn't travel well. <br><br>You see cherries here in early June which always disturbs me as they're flown from who knows where in the Northern hemisphere.<br><br>Good point about using different techniques. To rely on one would be a disaster, especially when so much information and technology is available.<br><br>You put me in mind of the various systems for heating water in my house. There are three choices all linked, yet no one system is the controller, yet each will provide a different result. There is:<br><br>Roof mounted solar hot water panels which only pump water when it is warmer in the panel than the reservoir tank - Unlimited;<br><br>LPG (liquified petroleum gas) hot water booster for when it's been cloudy or I can't be bothered starting a fire - Limited to the amount stored in gas bottles (about 12 months); and<br><br>Wood for when you want to get the water really hot - Unlimited there is a lot of hardwood up here.<br><br>Much like preserving, each system has it's own quirks and hassles. None is as simple as flicking a switch to access power generated elsewhere and all have their various limitations.<br><br>People who are connected upto the mainstream systems do not realise how vulnerable they are to supply shortages.<br><br>Food is exactly the same. If it's not local, then you've got a problem. For the past few years I've tried very hard to learn what is in season and what isn't. It doesn't get that cold here that things stop growing over winter (although it slows down a lot), I can't imagine what you lot in cooler climes have to provide for.<br><br>Is there a druid presence in Australia?<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><a href=two-lessons-in-practical-ecology.html#c4609519941976183532 title="comment permalink">12/16/10, 2:51 AM</a><br><br>

I am afraid to eat my smelly stuff and am buying kim chi and kraut from stores where it is legal to sell (in New Hampshire.) Right now I would consider starvation as a reasonable response to my sauerkraut.<br>Making hard cheese from our goat's milk is surprisingly easy - but it takes some serious time and reading of the directions in the cheese books. Extensive cheesemaking will have to wait until there is no more work in the FIRE economy.<br>What I would like to know from all of you is: which of these methods produces the most nutritious foods?

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c829412724758381563></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/10923413814725602687 rel=nofollow>Yupped</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>We've been working through food preservation and storage decisions these last few months. For our family, a fairly typical unit of consumption until a couple of years ago, the biggest challenge has been reframing what we need to eat (as opposed to want to eat). <br><br>The "doey" projects are attractive: getting a root cellar functioning, organizing a deep pantry, learning to can, doing some drying, etc. But we pretty quickly had to get serious and stop dabbling and address a few basics: how much of our food do will we grow ourselves, how much will we store vs buy over the winter, how many months of supplies do we need on hand, and how much of all this can we realistically get three American teenagers to eat anyway? <br><br>It's more difficult to tackle these questions when we're still in this sort of interim period (something real bad's coming but we don't quite know when, meanwhile the frog is simmering along...). Necessity being the mother of invention, and all that. But we've found it helpful to set some goals, and go for them with a fair amount of focus. In earlier lives my wife and I were "management consultants" (many apologies, Universe), so we like goals and numbers and stuff.

It is readily available all year in most any temperate climate, and with a little forethought many sources can be kept available even in the midst of winter.<br><br>Most notably, all the members of the Pine family, which includes Spruces, Firs, Hemlocks as well as the various Pines, contain Vitamin C in their needles. This is most concentrated in new shoots in the spring... I quite enjoyed nibbling on hemlock (I should note this is the tree Tsuga spp. and has nothing to do with the poisonous herbaceous plant of the same name) this past spring and look forward to doing so again in the spring. But even today, as it ices away outside and barely gets above 20, I could (and probably will) go gather a bundle of pine needles and cold steep a tea for some Vitamin C.<br><br>Countless wild foods contain vitamin C and in most any season some source can be collected from the wild -- right now Rosehips, Chickweed, Pine Needles for me -- which isn't to say folks should not store foods and herbs for this purpose, only to know that there are often backups if you cultivate the ability to read the landscape.<br><br>And count me among those who use a freezer. Since I live alone and am new to putting up food, it's really easy to get in from a few hours of picking blackberries and just throw them in the freezer and deal with them later. But I do see the day when I unplug it (from a useless outlet perhaps) and move it down to the root cellar to use as a rodent-proof seed storage/stratification box.<br><br>Banging together a solar food dehydrator is on the winter to-do based on the design from a nearby university that has a concentration in "Appropriate Technology" (!) of all things, and yet I sigh when I see how that has translated into work primarily focused on utility-scale wind research, biodiesel, and other nonsense. Occasionally it seems they do something that actually fits within my understanding of Appropriate Tech, but goodness if only they gave that subject more care and attention, what a resource they could be.

Our town is making a sustainability plan (independent of the transition town movement), which includes community gardens, local food-processing centers for residents to access and renewable energy on a community basis. No woodlots around here. I've been maintaining friendships with people who have different practical skill sets than my own.<br><br>I agree with hawkleye about cooking, which, without "convenience" foods takes a lot of time.

We live in a society where we have to worry the opposite, since food is everywhere and we want to cut calories.<br><br>But if TSHTF, you need to think about calories, to help stay warm and to fuel all that manual labor. Most veggies just aren't that loaded with them and most of us don't have room for sufficient grains. So keep things like potatoes, squash, and yams/sweet potatoes in mind too. They supply calories in bad times.<br><br>By the same reasoning, if TSHTF, you will be doing a 180 on fats too: animal/bird/fish, and the few veggies that have some, like avocado, nuts/seeds (not many grow here in Montana), or get yourself an oil press set-up for flax, etc. A guy on JMG's cultural conserver group made a homemade hydraulic press. Fats also serve for salves and medicines, fuel for small lamps, etc. We dis fats because we have a lot of food and eat too much, but in bad times, they are gold. Once I got dumped in an icy river when my canoe overturned, all my clothes got wet and I lost my fire stuff (temporarily) so I wrapped myself in plastic and had a tin of sardines in oil (I was shivering too hard to get the fire started). I drank the oil and it warmed me up so I could wade out and get my fire stuff from the canoe.<br><br><a href=two-lessons-in-practical-ecology.html#c3709072566306239278 title="comment permalink">12/16/10, 8:38 AM</a><br><br>

Last summer I made some very good deer jerky (if I do say so myself) by cutting some metal rack material I had down to size, sticking them in the bottom of some soft drink crates (the stackable kind you find in abundance behind convenience stores), placing the strips on the racks, and then wrapping it all up in some plastic screem material I had salvaged from who knows where. Only took a few hours on one of our hottest days of the year. It's actually slower in the oven, unless you risk cooking the meat instead of jerking it.<br><br>What I'm not sure of is what to do with the product. So far, I haven't made enough in a batch to have the problem, but I noticed that jerky collects a lot of moisture in the frige. Vacuum sealing with a desiccant pkg is the commercial norm, but that sounds like more technology than I want to deal with.<br><br>Canning meat is something I want to try, but I know it's not nearly as easy as fruits and vegetables. Right now, the freezer gets me through from one deer season to the next.<br><br><a href=two-lessons-in-practical-ecology.html#c3875563266888573046 title="comment permalink">12/16/10, 8:55 AM</a><br><br>

In my discussions with the mainstream, it is telling how few people take food security seriously.<br><br>I was fortunate enough to build my own house and one priority was a modernized root cellar/food safe. Whe built it from poured concrete off of the back of the kitchen utility area which is below grade. It is functioning as a root cellar should, and is rodent proof (unless a little buggar sneaks in while the door is open). Its steal door is hidden behind a set of movable shelves, more for space utilization than out of paranoia.<br><br>When my mother died I inherited hundreds of canning jars and all of the equipment. Thanks, Mom! I can often, even off-season (leftover soups and stews, etc.)<br><br>One preservation method not mentioned is vacuum packing. I found a nice vacuum packer with the hose attachment that had a bad motor. I replaced the small motor with a 12DC brushless that works well and can be run solar direct from a 75 watt panel. Another find was a box of 100 small tire valves. I drilled holes in regular canning lids and installed the valves (upside down). We fill jars with dried fruits, veggies and grains, then pull a vacuum on them. This extends the storage life dramatically. Those "As Seen on TV" vacuum storage bags (for clothes, etc.) work well for storing large bags of flour and grain, as well as bags of salt and sugar. They should last for years and can be evacuated using a hand pump.<br><br>Anything that can be run PV direct is a plus. Water pumps and brushless DC fans are examples. Many computer fans are 12VDC and can be powered directly from a PV panel. Adding a small fan to a solar dehydrator can cut drying time alot. A little techy, I know, but I always look for small advantages that might make a difference. Another use for a small fan like this is to ventilate a root cellar on cold sunny days, get the temp down earlier in the fall.<br><br>My next project is a larger smoker built from an old water heater. Being able to smoke large quanities of meats and sausages in less time seems important. Get'em smoked and hanging in the root cellar. <br><br>I've discovered that time management is critical when foods are ready for preservation. Be prepared before you harvest. Stockpile jar lids, salt, sugar, citric acid and vinegar for use until you can find local sources. Reusable canning lids are available. <br><br>Just some JMG inspired thoughts.

Enjoy that leg of lamb!<br><br>Lance, neither one -- it's the change in the chemistry of the vegetables themselves, many of which have been bred to have much more sugar and less acid. Canning tomatoes in a hot water bath was safe when tomatoes were a high-acid food, but a lot of tomatoes these days are so sweet that bacteria can thrive in them that couldn't touch them in the old days. <br><br>Adrian, I'll be talking quite a bit about cooking soon.

The reason people eat tiny portions of rabbit food these days -- well, aside from the stark gibbering terror of fat that obsesses so many people nowadays -- is that most of us have completely sedentary lives. Start working with your muscles and walking a couple of miles a day, and those old-fashioned farmhouse breakfasts -- steak and eggs, pancakes, fried apples, hash browns, and toast with plenty of butter, and yes, this is all one meal -- start to make a lot more sense. <br><br>Orange Sky, we've got a cold frame going for the first time this winter, with kale, radishes, turnips, and snow peas -- definitely a pleasant thing. As for rose hips, you want one of the old varieties, dog rose, sweetbriar, or apothecary rose -- we've got two of the latter in the back yard, and plan on harvesting hips as well as making our own rose water.<br><br>Hal, I'd try putting it in glass canning jars on a dry day and then fridging it. <br><br>Dragonfly, thank you!

Winter in cold climates demands (it doesn't ask politely) extra calories - meat and fat, milk (cheese, butter) and eggs, and higher-calorie foods such as berries (jam), honey, nuts, fish oils and starches will all become critically important once you can no longer drive down to the local store. Most of us have no idea what it means to become truly hungry, and when the temperature drops, fat for the brain is essential for proper decision-making as well. The indigenous populations well knew the value and life-saving properties of fat. There is a term, "rabbit starvation" that illustrates perfectly the dietary disaster of eating too much protein (low-fat rabbits) without the fat necessary for our biology.

First, it is possible even in the most humid climates to build a solar food dehydrator that will get you dry, rather than moldy food. There's a great model at www.manytracks.com in their homesteading section. I have one like it and it works extraordinarily well, even during the summer we had 40+ inches of rain.<br><br>Second, there are actually two answers to Lance's question. First, we have bred some borderline fruits into lower acidity, which raises the risk of botulism, particularly in tomatoes. But that's not the only reason. The other reason is that we know more about the chemistry of food preservation, and we know, for example, that tiny bits of mold in an imperfect seal, say under a lid that had some food on the rim, for example, can lower the acidity of marginal products to unsafe levels. The reality is that once upon a time, now and again someone dropped dead horribly from botulism.

You've really hit on a wonderful point, one so anethema to modernism that one rarely encounters it. The essence of your post is to emphasize the importance of plurality, in a practical but also a philosophical sense. <br><br>This opens an important door. A great number of people recognize the predicament our civilization is in but can't convincingly visualize a way forward. That visualization is really important, because without it, our situation is a desparate combination of psychological stress and functional paralysis. A breeding ground for despair, violence, and disease.<br><br>The way forward, though, is not a single way but rather many ways in concert.<br><br>The modern intellectual approach is not at all about plurality. It is monolithic, and this goes a long way toward explaining both its astounding successes and its fragility. Within the confines of its definition, a monolithic, focused system can achieve potent results such as putting a man on the moon, splitting the atom, or near instantaneous global communications. The ultimate apology for modernism is look at all the wonderful things that would not have been otherwise possible. <br><br>However, this focus and power has come at a cost. These achievements have required defining narrower bounds for operations than those presented by the natural world at large. Within an artificially closed system, energy can be made practically free as long as we define the system's boundary to keep out the "externalities" of environmental degradation and don't look so far into the future that sustainability rears its ugly head. With nearly free energy, of course, come our civilization's crowning achievments.<br><br>Another way of looking at this is that the monolithic system is intriniscally wasteful. The economists won't tell you this, but the common word for their externalities is waste. (I believe this will sound familiar to those versed in the exemplary writings of Wendell Berry.) <br><br>By contrast, a system sufficiently pluralistic to encompass the entire natural reality is traditional rather than modern. It has no wastes, since each output is also an input, and it is manifest in a network of adaptations to specific local circumstances rather than a single homegenous procedure applied at all levels. <br><br>It's no wonder the plural arrangement is the one that emerged from the physical conditions on this planet. Modernism is clearly exceptional. <br><br>I'm not setting up my own hard and fast dichotomy. The focused and monolithic activity has always had a place in human enterprise; the only new and truly dysfunctional thing is the idea that it can totally replace the plural, the custom-fit, and the compromise that are an essential part of connected natural systems. One day we'll be able to let go of that prejudice, and return to a healthy flexibility.<br><br><a href=two-lessons-in-practical-ecology.html#c8310889190412722046 title="comment permalink">12/16/10, 4:19 PM</a><br><br>

You have it the wrong way around. You need a large battery bank as the life of the battery bank can only be extended when you don't draw down on them very much. If you have all that generating capacity and no where to store it, it's a pointless system. Even worse, batteries being a chemical reaction, they don't store energy the same way a water tank stores water which will keep filling up at maximum supply until it is full. What I mean, is that as you near or exceed 85% capacity of stored energy in the batteries the systems charge controllers do not accept anywhere near the full generating capacity of the system to reduce the possibility of off gassing hydrogen (and I use sealed lead acid gel batteries which recombine the gas into the mixture).<br><br>A 1,000w wind turbine will also require a dump load to absorb all of the excess generating capacity that your batteries charge controller rejects. If you do not have this, the turbine may self destruct - this is not such a problem with a smaller capacity wind turbine generator.<br><br>Any off grid electrical system comes at the end of a long and technical industrial process. It can't be muddled through. The whole system is vulnerable from the regulators, to the fuses, to the inverter - not to mention the batteries themselves.<br><br>An electric vehicle consumes 300w of energy to travel 1km (apologies for the metric units). A sealed lead acid battery containing enough energy to travel 10km weighs around 100kg. The batteries I use in my house have 30,000w of energy (about 10 days supply for me) and weigh 1,200kg. This weight is more than the weight of either of my petrol driven vehicles. With this power and not taking the weight into consideration, I could only travel 100km. The most efficient vehicle I have uses 6 litres of petrol to perform the same magic of travelling 100km.<br><br>We use 240 volt wiring in Australia. My understanding of the commercially available electric vehicles here is that they require a 15amp socket and take upwards of 8 hours to charge (or I think about 1 to 2 hours for an 80% charge). My off grid system which is considered to be pretty good, could only power this for about half an hour before shutting down due to overload. <br><br>Given the price of electricity (and it's cheap here because of the use of brown coal), it still makes very little sense to have an electric vehicle.<br><br>Electric vehicles are not a good idea for the sort of commuting that people do on a daily basis.<br><br>I'd stick to growing fruit and vegetables as a sensible precaution.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><a href=two-lessons-in-practical-ecology.html#c7319425544882525715 title="comment permalink">12/16/10, 11:02 PM</a><br><br>

Living without meat can be done and it has been done. Helen and Scott Nearing lived this way for over 50 years in rural Vermont, then Maine. And they worked outside with their hands---building stone houses, chopping wood, etc. You can read about it in their book "The Good Life." <br><br>They ate some dairy and traded long-distance for things like olive oil and avocados, and they remained quite healthy, all within a low energy context, off-the-grid. I'm sure there are some out there who would argue endlessly about how living entirely without meat is unsustainable, uneconomical, or undesirable for a number of reasons, and I wouldn't disagree with them, on many points. Meat has great utility, to be sure. My point is not that eliminating meat *should* be done, but merely that it *can* be done, even in a cold-climate, heavy-manual-labor, low-fossil-fuel context. <br><br>Anyone who's read The Good Life would be quick to point out that the Nearings were fanatics, and didn't even own pets because they considered it exploitation. But hey, I'm sure this blog's readership has its fair share of fanatics, too. A couple readers have cited sources from Sally Fallon of the--arguably fanatical anti-soy and anti-vegetarian--Weston A. Price movement. I would say this: please be wary of anyone who says "you have to eat meat."

There is little cost and great benefit to "over-canning." Recommended times and pressures are <b>minima</b> for safe canning. I always pressure can tomatoes, even though boiling water is still considered safe in some circles. The cost: a bit of extra fuel, a bit more excess heat in the house (though this can be nice at the end of the season when the big pre-freeze harvest comes in just before the first good cold snap!), perhaps a very slight additional loss of color and texture. The benefit: vastly greater peace of mind whenever you use your canned goods.<br><br>When canning mixed foods (e.g. salsa), can to the longest requirement of anything in the mix. So if your salsa has peppers and onions in it, pressure can it for the longest time recommended for any individual ingredient, even thought it might be 90% tomatoes. <br><br>There is no reason to skimp on canning. If you can't afford the fuel to run the pressure canner, better to solar dry the food than take an elevated risk of poisoning. Dried home-grown tomatoes are also fantastically delicious!<br><br><a href=two-lessons-in-practical-ecology.html#c3770363801104546765 title="comment permalink">12/17/10, 3:24 PM</a><br><br>

To be totally PC, you should have all the hardware from the back of the fridge carefully removed, with special attention to bleeding out the coolant. Clean and disinfect the inside of the fridge. Dig a hole in the dirt floor and bury the fridge on its back so that the level of the dirt comes to within an inch or two of the doors. Now start piling in the root vegies. At the end, you need a candle with its wick trimmed good and short so when you light it you get a small not-too-hot flame. Ideally it should be inside an old tin can or glass jar to prevent it touching something or dripping wax on the produce. Last thing before you close up your new root cellar, light the candle and set it inside. It will use up all the oxygen in the sealed space and then go out harmlessly. Every time you get something out of the root cellar, light the candle last thing, just like the first time. <br><br>This arrangement works great for beets and cabbage family roots. I have not tried it for other roots (such as potatoes or sunchokes) or above-ground storage vegies such as cabbage.<br><br><a href=two-lessons-in-practical-ecology.html#c6283908558433061051 title="comment permalink">12/17/10, 6:12 PM</a><br><br>

Here fresh local produce consists of radishes, turnips, kale, and snow peas from the cold frame. <br><br>Hawlkeye, security's also an issue -- it's amused me to watch how fast the people who mocked Jim Kunstler for warning of piracy in <i>The Long Emergency</i> shut up when Somali pirates hit the news. Still, if transportation costs mean that a dinner made from imported food costs twice (or fifteen times) as much as one made from local produce, there isn't going to be much of a market for anything but the things you plan to get off the boat. (Me, I want good tea from China!) <br><br>Blue Sun, if eating a vegetarian diet works for you, great. It certainly doesn't work for everyone, but then neither does any other diet. <br><br>Ric, you need to talk to some old-fashioned astrologers -- the kind who casts charts by hand instead of using a computer program. They don't need Legos to predict eclipses and tell you when the evening star is going to appear next! Mind you, the Antikythera mechanism is a lovely bit of technology, and hand-cranked, too, but Legos may be in short supply in a deindustrial future...<br><br>Matt and Jess, you can certainly use modern methods to can heirloom vegetables -- my spouse and I have done it with good results, and so have most of the other home canners we know. <br><br>DIYer, hmm -- you'd want to make sure the plastic wouldn't leach anything unwelcome into your food, just to start with. Still, an interesting concept. <br><br>Sarah, I agree with you in general -- I don't do at all well on a vegetarian diet, and I know people who have ruined their health trying to follow one -- but I'm going to draw a line at this point beneath the whole topic of meat vs. meatless diets, because it very quickly tends to degenerate into anger on both sides. Darwin will settle who's right!<br><br>Bill, I certainly agree about drying. We can pickles, jams, and other high-acid foods that can be done in a boiling water bath, but that's about it -- all the extra tomatoes from this year's harvest went into the food dryer, and we'll be enjoying the results all winter long. <br><br>Mary, thanks for the link!<br><br>Joan, nice.

If you completely exclude oxygen from it, it will die and rot. A live potato, if stored in a cool location, has mechanisms shared by other living things to protect it from oxygen damage. Of course its storage life is limited, and it's best if kept cool and dry, but not too dry. <br><br>A can of tomatoes is not alive, and oxygen can only degrade it. <br><br>Oh, and thanks to Sharon and others for mentioning botulism -- no laughing matter.

Don't overbuy." Too often, the new owner will look for an experienced and talented hunter-jumper, racer, and rodeo star. At a cheap price. <br><br>The reality is - don't buy a horse suited to do what you will take a year or two learning. First, by the time you reach that skill level, your interests will have developed as well - and that 'perfect' horse won't likely be what you need at that time. Second, if the horse is a highly skilled performer - the new owner doesn't have the skill to keep the horse in productive discipline or how to even ride the horse safely, since the horse expects professional skill levels from his rider. And, lastly, spending too much for the horse often means that there isn't enough money left to provide adequate care.<br><br>The most important tool is one that you know how to use well.<br><br>Rather than buy or build your destination setup, start with what you are ready to use now.

And it states that commecial oxygen absorbers are in polymer (plastic) packaging. Furthermore, it suggests putting the iron wool oxygen scavenger in a paper towel (paper that could have been bleached with chlorine or sulfur dioxide). Also note that steel wool you buy from the hardware store is probably treated with a bit of machine oil to slow down the rusting process. So you'll run into traces of various chemicals everywhere. <br><br>In fact, I see a flaw in storing the absorbers in freezer bags. As I mentioned in my first post, oxygen will be pulled right through the bag and the steel will continue to rust in that environment. <br><br>As for the novel idea of using oxygen absorbers in canning, it probably does have some details to be ironed out. In pressure-canning, the air should be driven out by steam anyway, so residual oxygen isn't a big problem. <br><br>I see from a web search that these absorbers are typically used for dry foods. Might be an interesting exercise to calculate how much iron you need to remove all residual oxygen from a glass jar of dry nuts sealed in air at room temperature.

The problem with doing this is that the population may in turn, ask for something to be done about it. <br><br>The difficulty comes when the reality is that for anything constructive to be achieved, the standard of living must (for the general population itself) be reduced.

If your food is properly dried, it will keep whether the oxygen is there or not. If it is incompletely dried, it will ferment away just fine even in a completely anoxic environment. In fact, that is part of how black tea is made -- the undried green tea leaves are rolled tightly to make an anaerobic environment, where they ferment. Similarly, the real way that canning works is by sterilizing the food and sealing it to keep microbes out, not so much by keeping the oxygen out. Again, if the food is sterile but there is still oxygen in the sealed jar, it won't spoil (it might brown a bit as the residual oxygen reacts with the food until it is used up, but that is not dangerous). But if the food is not sterilized, even if it is completely anoxic it will still spoil and possibly grow a big fat crop of botulism. <br><br>Given this, where exactly do the oxygen absorbers fit in to this picture?<br><br><a href=two-lessons-in-practical-ecology.html#c8438880451187030721 title="comment permalink">12/20/10, 6:28 AM</a><br><br>

This can be a problem especially with foods high in polyunsaturated fats, where oxidation can lead to chain reactions which can cause the whole lot to go rancid. If you've smelled improperly stored peanut butter or whole wheat flour you'll understand. Also oxidation of vitamins will gradually degrade the food value. Storing grains and beans in their whole raw state slows down the process because, as others have said, the living dormant tissues have structures which protect the oils, but once cooked or ground all bets are off.<br><br><a href=two-lessons-in-practical-ecology.html#c3275254187137481669 title="comment permalink">12/23/10, 5:25 AM</a><br><br>
