One of the advantages of being a Druid is that you get to open your holiday presents four days early. Sara and I had a very pleasant Solstice yesterday, with a ceremony welcoming the newborn sun, gifts by turns practical and silly, the little traditions every family evolves for its celebrations, and of course a large and tasty Solstice dinner. With that under my belt, I’m feeling ready to tackle one of the most loaded questions any peak oil writer can face.<br><br>No, I’m not going to join in the all-but-shooting war over the portrayal of women in James Howard Kunstler’s latest peak oil novel, <i>The Witch of Hebron</i> – not yet, anyway, though I do plan on reviewing the book down the road a bit. I don’t propose to discuss the role of firearms and organized violence in preparing for the arrival of deindustrial society just now, either, and despite the entreaties of several of my regular readers – I’ll leave their motivations an open question – I don’t intend to talk about whether or not hemp is the wonder plant that will save us from peak oil. I plan instead on addressing an American obsession, one that has baffled, annoyed, and amused foreigners and tied the brains of Americans in square knots since colonial times and shows no sign of letting up any time soon.<br><br>That is to say, it’s time to talk about food.<br><br>That doesn’t mean, I hasten to add, that I’m going to speak out either for or against any of the current crop of fad diets, or for that matter any of their countless equivalents from the past. Fad diets are a fact of life in America, and there’s an interesting reason for that: changing your diet makes you feel better. It actually doesn’t matter how you change your diet. There’s a guy who made headlines on the bottom-feeder end of the media not long ago by doing a diet consisting entirely of junk food, and who lost fifteen pounds and feels much better since he started that diet; there’s another guy who ate nothing but potatoes for thirty days and had his health improve noticeably. Based on my observations, the effect of taking up a new fad diet lasts for six to eight months on average, and then you end up feeling pretty much the way you did before. Those among us who start a new fad diet every January, and drift out of it sometime later in the year, may actually have the right idea.<br><br>Still, that’s not a way of thinking that Americans find congenial, and the reasons for this reach back, I’m convinced, to our nation’s Puritan heritage. Puritanism has been usefully defined as the profound and inescapable fear that somebody, somewhere is having a good time, but it also has a very distinctive relationship to the concept of evil. Evil, to a Puritan, is a concrete reality capable of precise physical location; it lurks around you, ready to jump out at you from the shadows at any moment; but if you can identify it, hate it, and cast it out, then you’re good and you go to Heaven.<br><br>This is essentially the way most Americans think about food. Each of the fad diets in circulation these days identifies some particular component of food as Satan incarnate, and insists that if you hate it loudly enough and cast it out of your diet, then you’re good and you go to whatever secular equivalent of heaven contemporary fashion happens to be offering at the moment. (A century ago Americans dieted to gain weight; now they diet to lose weight; doubtless the pendulum will swing back the other way in due time, and people will once again panic over being too thin.) Whether the Satan in your diet of choice is meat, fat, carbohydrate, salt, sugar, too much cholesterol, not enough cholesterol, the wrong kind of cholesterol, or what have you, there’s some street corner preacher ready to urge you to renounce your dietary sins and get right with Good Digestion.<br><br>Druidry doesn’t tend to foster street corner preachers, though, and the wars between contending fad diets don’t really have that much to offer the Green Wizard project with which the current series of posts here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i> is mostly concerned. No, I want to talk about something a good deal more basic: the awkward fact that the food you can produce in your backyard garden, or acquire in any other way likely in a deindustrializing world, does not magically appear in the forms that most Americans are used to consuming. A nation used to eating factory-breaded chicken tenders and JoJos to go is going to face some interesting traumas when food once again consists of live chickens, raw turnips, and fifty-pound sacks of dry navy beans.<br><br>It’s easy as well as entertaining to poke fun at America along these lines, but the difficulties involved are very real. A very large fraction of today’s Americans, provided with a plucked chicken, a market basket of fresh vegetables, and that fifty-pound sack of navy beans, would be completely at a loss if asked to convert them into something tasty and nourishing to eat. The torrent of cheap fossil fuel energy that has so completely transformed the rest of life in the industrial world has worked overtime on America’s food system, and this isn’t just a matter of how many miles a meal has traveled – how many <i>factories</i> has it and its ingredients passed through on the way to your plate?<br><br>As the age of cheap energy winds down, it will stop being economically viable to process food in huge centralized facilities and then to ship it hundreds of miles in refrigerated trucks to far-flung stores for just-in-time distribution to commuters shopping for dinner on their drive home from work. As that stops being economically viable, those people who know how to produce good meals by some less energy-intensive method will be a lot better off than those who don’t. Most people who have had any significant contact with the concept of peak oil will admit this, but all too often a curious thing happens next; they sigh, and talk wistfully about how nice it would be if they had the vast amounts of spare time and the demanding technical skills that cooking meals from scratch requires, but they don’t, of course, so it’s chicken tenders for dinner again.<br><br>You may be thinking something similar, dear reader. You may be thinking that it’s all very well to praise home-cooked meals produced from raw materials, but cooking that way is a very time-consuming process, not to mention one that involves a vast amount of hard work. You’ve seen the gyrations that actors in chef hats go through in cooking programs on TV, you’ve glanced over the forbidding pages full of exotic ingredients and bizarre processes that make today’s gourmet cookbooks read like so many tomes of dire enchantment out of bad fantasy fiction, you’ve seen racks of women’s magazines that treat elaborate timewasting exercises disguised as cooking instructions as a goal every family ought to emulate, and you’ve unconsciously absorbed the legacy of most of a century of saturation advertising meant to convince you that cooking things for yourself from scratch is an exercise in the worst sort of protracted drudgery, and probably gives you radioactive halitosis and ring around the collar to boot, so you really ought to give it up and go buy whatever nice product the nice man from the nice company is trying to sell you.<br><br>If all this has convinced you that you don’t have time to cook, dear reader, you have been had.<br><br>Maybe it’s that my grandfather retired after twenty years in the Aberdeen, WA fire department with a reputation as the best firehouse cook in Grays Harbor County; maybe it’s because my stepmother, who taught me how to cook, grew up eating the Tokyo working class equivalent of down home cooking in the years during and after the Second World War; or maybe it’s because when I left home and settled into my first tiny apartment, two rooms, shared bath, the two cookbooks I had to get me started were the original edition of <i>Tassajara Cooking</i> and <i>The New Cookbook for Poor Poets</i> – whatever the reason, the programming somehow failed to rub off on me. I’ve always believed in cooking from raw materials; I’ve always believed that making a good meal should take no more of my time – that is, no more time in which I actually have to do something, as distinct from any amount of time the food spends cooking off by itself – than the fifteen minutes or so it takes me to eat the result; and I’ve never encountered the least difficulty reconciling those two beliefs.<br><br>In other words, by the time you’ve gotten off the freeway on the way home from work, fought your way through congested surface streets to the grocery store, found a parking place, done the breast stroke through the crowds between you and the deli counter, caught the attention of a clerk, waited for your order of chicken tenders and Jo-Jos to be heaped into a couple of plastic containers, stood in line again to check out, escaped from the parking lot, fought your way back through those same congested surface streets, and staggered home, I’ve cooked a homemade meal from scratch and am setting it out on the table. Now of course the plum glaze on the pork chops was put up in an orgy of canning two years ago, the vegetable bean soup took ten minutes of knife work and eight hours in a fireless cooker over the weekend and is being parcelled out of the fridge a couple of bowls at a time, and it took me a couple of minutes this morning to pick the makings of the salad out of the cold frame, but if we count an appropriate fraction of those activities in my time, then we probably also need to count the half hour or so you had to work to pay for the difference between the cost of your dinner and the cost of mine.<br><br>All this is meant to suggest that there’s an entire world of cooking that has nothing to do with elaborate gourmet dishes, on the one hand, or takeout food and plastic packages on the other. A great deal of today’s cultural dialogue about food has done its level best to obscure that fact. I have a soft spot for the current “Slow Food” movement, but the very choice of that movement’s name points out that it’s unlikely ever to be anything more than an affectation of the leisured well-to-do. People who work all day, whether at a job or at home, don’t generally have time for slow food, and it doesn’t do them any good at all to reinforce a set of assumptions that insist that the only alternative to slow food is the prefabricated industrial product that passes these days for fast food.<br><br>What’s needed, really, is the revival of the sort of cooking that working class people used to do for themselves back in the days before cheap energy made the current food system possible: good food cooked in a way that doesn’t place unreasonable demands on the time or energy of people who have many other things to do. The phrase “down home cooking” can be translated into pretty much every language on Earth, and refers to different raw materials and recipes in almost every one of them, so I don’t propose to get into specifics here; you, dear reader, probably have a fair idea of the kinds of food you like to eat, and that rather than random suggestions from archdruids should be your guide. <i>De gustibus non disputandum est</i>; which is to say that in food choices, above all else, dissensus rules.<br><br>In place of a specific resource list, then, I’d like to recommend those of my readers who are pursuing the green wizardry project to take a look at the resources for down home recipes they have available to them, perhaps in their families, perhaps in their communities, perhaps through other channels. The recipes to look for aren’t the fancy ones you’ll find in glossy recent cookbooks that are meant to gaze scornfully down from the bookshelf and overawe the guests; the recipes you want, rather, are the ones that Grandma Mildred used to make when it was just her and Grandpa George sitting down to dinner on a Monday night when the rest of the work week was still ahead, the ones that old Uncle Benny remembers from his days in the fire department or the merchant marine, or the ones that an elderly lady in the church your great-grandmother attended wrote out longhand in blue ink to give to your great-grandmother as a wedding gift. You might find them in old mimeographed Grange cookbooks with spiral bindings, or stuffed in the back of the recipe box you got from somebody in the family and never really sorted through, or – well, you get the idea. See what you can find.<br><br>One way or another, the sort of cooking I’ve discussed here will stage a comeback in the age after petroleum. The huge industrial infrastructure that undergirds today’s food system is not going to survive the end of the energy surpluses that created it, and when it unravels – perhaps slowly, perhaps in one vast JoJodammerung, a Twilight of the Chicken Tenders on a Wagnerian scale – people are still going to need to eat. The more people there are who have taken the time to learn the not unduly difficult skills of producing good food quickly, cheaply, and easily, the more time and energy will be available to tackle the many other challenges that we’re going to face as the age of cheap energy stumbles toward its end.

Often that "meal from scratch" includes ingredients that were canned by me at other times of the year, but all things considered, the homemade meal is just as fast, and it's by far tastier.<br><br>And that's the other thing I discovered - that I may find a take-out meal that will fill my belly, but I have not bought a prepared meal from the grocery store or a restaurant that tastes better than what I can make here at home ;). Which is saying a lot, because I'm not a terribly talented (or creative) cook :).<br><br>The final lesson that I've learned is that cooking at home is considerably cheaper than buying a ready-made meal. Even if the ingredients include the slightly more expensive locally grown organic produce or home-grown chicken we presserved during the summer. We've saved thousands of dollars per year by eating our home-prepared food rather than eating out and the food is more tasty and better for us. <br><br>Once I figured all of that out, I didn't need any convincing to cook at home. Now, my family has a hard time convincing me to eat out ;).<br><br><a href=#c5104594779501972455 title="comment permalink">12/22/10, 8:13 PM</a><br><br>

We have less cabbage and more collards, for example. The solar dryers spend a long summer waiting for the apples and tomatoes, and we've learned to dry foliage (collards, kale, chard, spinach, beet greens, turnip greens) and crumble it up to make our own "spices" which go great in breads or soups or with duck eggs and Yukon Gold spuds. Good recipes with these ingredients just happen -- I don't think we've ever written one down, except as blog narratives. We forage a lot, too.<br><br>Our parents went the other way -- canned biscuits, TV dinners, the whole devolution of food after WWII. And my grandparents were from the deep South and the recipes were HEAVY with lard and such. So I'm happy we started over.<br><br>There is something we don't eat often which we grow a lot of: sunchokes. They are an acquired taste we never quite acquired, but could live with. We call it the TEOTWAWKI patch: what to eat if we run out of spuds not reserved for seed.<br><br><a href=#c1323542534019456522 title="comment permalink">12/22/10, 8:22 PM</a><br><br>

Good!<br><br>Risa, do you have livestock other than ducks at Stony Run? Goats in particular are mighty fond of sunchokes, and thrive on them. As for the dried greens, excellent! I've done that sometimes as a replacement for the dried seaweed I grew up using in soups and the like; it does fairly well.<br><br><a href=#c8008570648353291578 title="comment permalink">12/22/10, 8:36 PM</a><br><br>

Working people's food. No haute cuisine. I learned a lot from my grandparents from the Depression (dad's side) and my Mom whose mother had a homecooking restaurant where everything was made from scratch in the 1930s and 1940s. Biscuits and gravy. Trout in cornmeal. Today for lunch we made leftover soup from ham on the bone, with beans and cabbage. We don't eat out, no money for it, and homecooking tastes better and better for you too. Pies, bread, whatever you have from scratch. Soups, meat broth. Lots of water to drink. Buffalo roast slow-cooked with potatoes. Beets and greens. Moose my dad shot. Last summer, salad of greens from lambsquarters, dandelion and violets.<br><br>For a few years, when I was working at a fulltime job and had money and no time, the junkfood was predominant. Eating out was de rigeur. Now though it's all back to how it was when I was growing up. That's the good side of being poor and underemployed, you have to get creative and you have the time to do it. <br><br>For those who might not have seen it, his 91-year-old lady cooks some tasty and solid inexpensive food from the Great Depression, while reminiscing of how it was to raise food, eat meals, cook in those days, and just live:<br>http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=depression+cooking&amp;aq=f<br><br><a href=#c6740910757318784878 title="comment permalink">12/22/10, 9:08 PM</a><br><br>

I'm pretty sure I had a couple do-it-myself recipes under my belt by the time I was seven. I've gone on to try fermentation, and I plan for my next foray to be those fireless cookers you mentioned. <br><br>Incidentally, at first I interpreted "chicken tenders" as "ones who tend chickens".<br><br><a href=#c666615322236091360 title="comment permalink">12/22/10, 9:10 PM</a><br><br>

A few things I've learned:<br><br>* Plan ahead, or keep something around that prepares quickly. The time to start a pot of soup or a loaf of bread is well before you start to feel hungry. I keep store-bought cheese and tortillas around to paper over my mistakes.<br><br>* Management of the leftovers has become an important consideration.<br><br>* My refrigerator is much larger than I need now.<br><br><a href=#c5240373147630578880 title="comment permalink">12/22/10, 9:14 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avtb a_856ab8" id=c4629120411302707613></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/03393289177690725145 rel=nofollow>Cathy McGuire</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt><i>A very large fraction of today’s Americans, provided with a plucked chicken, a market basket of fresh vegetables, and that fifty-pound sack of navy beans, would be completely at a loss </i><br>Oh, no - if you pluck the chicken, I'll do fine! ;-) I've cooked from scratch for decades; I agree with Wendy that processed food doesn't taste nearly as good as my own cooking - and mine is much cheaper! I rely a lot on the crockpot, but will definitely try the fireless cooker some day. And spices can help you vary the menu quite a lot, even with the same basic ingredients! So basic doesn't have to be boring.<br><br>But I agree with you that fewer people know -- or want to know -- how to cook, and I guess I wasn't paying attention when all my friends and family shifted to this pre-processed crap. It's so sad to visit them! In fact, I'm spending Christmas with a friend, who is ordering in the whole dinner (for 8) like she's done for years. I don't judge my friends; they all have crammed lives, but I would be depressed if I couldn't cook meals from scratch. <br><br>However, unlike Risa, my problem is learning to eat what I grow. Never been much of a greens person, but I'm trying hard to eat what grows (figuring that being able to grow my meals is too much of a benefit to pass up). Slowly, I'm adding veggie recipes to the usual casseroles and roasts. Right now it's practice; later I might be very glad I have the know-how. And since I got chickens, I can feed them the greens I don't get to (actually, they help themselves) so I don't feel as guilty. (Unfortunately, people are so germ-phobic, they won't eat bug-holed greens, so I can't even donate them).<br><br><a href=#c4629120411302707613 title="comment permalink">12/22/10, 9:37 PM</a><br><br>

We did gardening in the summers and in the fall my mother would can up a storm. Beans, pickles, pickled vegetables, jams and jellies.<br><br>On weekends she would make big pots of home made soups or stews from whatever leftovers were around supplemented by some fresh veggies and it would usually involve a boiled chicken (which I was then charged with boning and cutting up).<br><br>This past year after far too many years of eating prepared foods and eating out, I've headed back to that old style of cooking. Sadly I don't have any of our old family recipes since they were all in my mother's head, but I learned enough helping her and watching to have the basics.<br><br>It really isn't that hard and the rewards are boundless.<br><br><a href=#c142800559496317223 title="comment permalink">12/22/10, 9:51 PM</a><br><br>

And of course that is a huge part of the modern problem! (I probaby have a sixth of the trash my friends toss out weekly) But the amount of denial it takes to do that on a regular basis (eat and toss, eat and toss) is mindblowing.<br><br><br>Secondly, a recent experience w/junk food: once every six months I get myself into the jammed space of needing to buy something fast in an unfamiliar neighborhood. This week, I stopped at a fast food place and ordered chili cheese fries (yes, it must have been temporary insanity)-- the first two bites were <b>horrible</b>; it was cardboard with recycled grizzle and orange glue. But then, something like a chemical reaction grabbed me and I couldn't stop eating them, in fact my taste buds shifted and they tasted - well, not good, but not disgusting, and weirdly addicting! Maybe it was MSG, but <b>something</b> hit my system and quickly made some physical change; I don't know how else to describe it. And I wonder if fast-food eaters have a similar reaction that causes them to crave those obviously non-nutritive substances.<br><br><a href=#c3463110212275593418 title="comment permalink">12/22/10, 10:00 PM</a><br><br>

I've always liked to play with my food, but this fall I got religious about stocking the cupboard with "fixings." I don't buy a lot of red meat, so hamburger for Thanksgiving was a big treat. I thought I was going to make little meatballs with mushroom soup and Amish style noodles, but when I checked what I had in the house I realized I had red wine and sour cream, too! Stroganoff! (Seasoned with some homemade vegetable stock from the freezer.) All I needed from the store was paprika.<br><br>I looked up contradictory recipes online and decided to wing it: It was fabulous ! I am still patting myself on the back. --But what really brought the lesson home? I have a little homeless guy in the neighborhood who has been dropping by once or twice a week. As a "producer" I can get him a hot meal in minutes.

My dad left when I was very young so I have always been involved with cooking from scratch and on a budget (out of necessity). It was fortunate really. My main resource is a well used and well loved textbook I picked up in school in year 8 back in the early 80's and it's called "Cooking the Australian Way". Everything is shown from scratch and it's all the sort of basic foods that you can eat every day.<br><br>Recently I've taken to making my own bread, foccacia's etc. and I'm not looking back. It's actually quicker, cheaper and uses less energy than going to the local bakery. I now know I've been conned all these years and I find purchased bread to be tasteless. You can even grow your own yeasts if you want - it's really easy. We've even done our own Christmas cake this year (heavy on the brandy unlike shop one's!).<br><br>I'm not sure what chicken tenders are but they don't sound good. We're getting our chickens + rooster next week after I complete the chook mansion and run over the next few days. Next project - what to do about the fox.<br><br>I find it strange that people say that they don't have time to cook. What are they doing with their time? Probably watching TV...<br><br>I have a favourite saying "people make time for the things they want to do". Kind of annoys people sometimes though.<br><br>Try home cooking from scratch - it's not hard.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><a href=#c5660358024321681641 title="comment permalink">12/23/10, 1:44 AM</a><br><br>

I wonder if our post industrial futures include more homegrown/killed meat, even if it is only once a year or so. I also wonder about healing foods, such as teas and beers, and whether there is a connection to particular foods and healing aside from the larger "change" sense to which you refer.

Long before I was aware of our current predicament, I had lengthy rants about such things as *pancake mix*. Really - how much time is saved by the manufacturer mixing the (inferior) flour and baking powder??!! You still have to add milk, oil and egg. Why not throw caution to the wind and mix the ingredients yourself? Ditto cornbread - and all the mixes. How hard is it to dump whole wheat flour and corn meal into a bowl instead of opening a box?! Oh dear, I can feel myself getting all worked up again .<br><br>I'm with you John - cooking need not take up that much time - 'conventional wisdom'says that shopping time is recreation and cooking time work, when I view that the other way around. <br><br>There are techniques to learn, though. Recently, I have reduced my dependence on canned beans by using my 20 year old pressure cooker for dry beans. After an all day soak (or an hour quick soak), it's only 6 minutes to beans for supper. Sometimes I even plan ahead, and get the chickpeas cooked tonight for tomorrow's hummus. <br><br>Risa - I really never though about drying the kale, but it would be very handy for soup etc. Thanks!<br>Also ditto for the sunchokes.

I didn't really cook at all, other than an odd job or two in my youth until I was in my late 30's, post divorce, and uprooted from my native culture. I found that I liked it and quickly became proficient at it, and if I can say so myself, actually pretty good.<br><br>I've since remarried, and food and cooking represent one of the major differences between my wife and I. She's a major proponent of the ready-made meal, while I'm a cook from scratch kind of guy. Admittedly, my wife does most of the day to day cooking because I work outside the home, while her active profession is currently taking care of our kids.<br><br>Still, frequently, I am at home watching the kids and making our meals. Fresh pasta, for example, with a few exceptions like raviolis or tortellinis can be made in quantities sufficient for a meal in about the same amount of time it takes a pot of water to come to a boil. The time required to prep and roast a whole chicken is no more than is required to defrost frozen chicken tenders and turn them into a far less healthy and satisfying meal, and the time that the chicken is in the oven can be used to mind and organize the kids with time left over for side dishes. It additionally yields the ingredients for two to three more meals requiring even less time.<br><br>Although it sometimes acts as a bone of contention in my marriage, my wife willingly yields the cooking for feast days over to me and proudly acts as hostess over a fare of scratch-cooked dishes.<br><br>An acquaintance of mine once quipped on the importance of food to survival 'Eat food or die'. Food is quite literally the stuff of life. As such, it is my belief that anything so important to existence is worthy of time and care, far more so than many things that are only incidental to life.<br><br>It isn't my intention to condemn those that don't scratch-cook - there are, after all, entire industries and branches of academia devoted to convincing them that their time is to precious to spend on such mundane tasks as ensuring their own well-being.

Also, Harold McGee's "Keys to Good Cooking" has no recipes, but offers a rational way to interpret other cookbooks (when it is important to follow a recipe exactly and when it isn't), and tips to save time and effort. I also have a deal with some friends to trade chickens when they stop laying, so we don't have to kill our own "pets."

The issue will be the production and transformation of raw materials into ingredients ready to cook. I have serious doubts that most people will be able to produce in their backyard enough calories efficiently to keep themselves alive. The backbone of agriculture is grain and pulse. In an agrarian society, meat and vegetables are mostly nutritional supplements. The calories come from the carbs, as wheat, rice or corn etc. The hitch is that the infrastructure for small scale production and transformation of cereals and pulses is gone in most locals. Better pray the Midwest and the Canadian prairies will still grow and ship grain reliably. Others important sources of calories are labor intensive. Shelling 50 pounds of beans manually is daunting, so is plucking, gutting and butchering 20-30 birds, much so any larger animals such as a goat or a pig. <br><br>So, I would think that one thing that people need to consider at the very top of their priorities is to source their grains and pulses as locally as possible. If we don't start making profitable for local small farmers and small mills to grow and process those staples, we will be in very serious troubles, no matter if we cook from scratch, have a garden and raise a few chickens. The 100 pounds flour bag was the big item in my grand-mother pantry, even if my grand-father had an orchard, a big garden and raised chickens. As well, dairies and small scale abattoirs have more or less been wiped out of the map. That's another challenge. <br><br>We growth and raise much of our foodstuff and honestly, by the time I am done all the outdoor work and some of the transformation (I can a lot and I butcher quite a few of my own animals, the rest I have done locally), that frozen pizza looks pretty darn convenient and tasty. That's how tired I am at the end of the day. Picking up a few greens from the garden is light work, not so growing, harvesting and lugging around 200-400 pounds of potatoes for winter storage.<br><br><a href=#c7119894495220659662 title="comment permalink">12/23/10, 6:20 AM</a><br><br>

I know that is not the normal term to use for going to a supermarket and picking up a bunch of microwaveable pre-processed packages of food, but essentially that is what we’ve done. <br><br>Outsourcing began in your home and eventually spread to other areas of the economy. Sure, there has always been some outsourcing of food production. Not every home in history raised meat or even enough vegetables for everyone. But the format of purchased food has changed significantly. Potatoes that were once grown at home were replaced with store-bought potatoes from the local shop, which in turn spurred the economies of scale as supermarkets sent small grocers to the trash heap of history. Real, fresh potatoes, with dirt still on them gave way to a myriad of pre-processed potatoes: tinned and peeled baby potatoes, washed bags of potatoes, frozen potatoes, pre-cut potatoes, bags of fries to be dropped into hot oil. We even have fries with the oil impregnated into the surface so they will cook in the oven. This outsourcing of the process of taking a vegetable out of the ground and making a meal out of it reached its apex with the powdered potato mix. Just add boiling water, maybe some butter, and stir.<br><br><a href=#c7618508990143252363 title="comment permalink">12/23/10, 9:33 AM</a><br><br>

Joy to all.<br><br>Yay homemade food! Every Sunday I put on music and start in to cooking, which helps for meals during the week. A good soup or my favorite lentil and barley stew may be quick to put together, but there is often a long simmering time; for sweet potato pie with cheese and sesame seed crust, by the time you make the crust, boil the sweet potatoes, mash them, assemble everything and bake, you're talking two hours--though the time-thrifty cook will be doing other food prep as well--again, best made ahead of time.

I agree, a well-stocked larder and cooking ahead are key for quick meals on busy days.<br><br>So many people aren't home enough hours at a time to put homemade bread through two risings or do other food prep tasks that, while not requiring actual hours of work, do require hours of being around.<br><br>I belong to a cooking and brewing extended family, so our get-togethers are bounteous.

I especially like "JoJoDammerung." Anyways, consider this: Right now a semi-trailer hauling 40,000 pounds of food 1500 miles (supposed US average) and getting 5 miles to a gallon has a cost for 300 gallons of diesel of about $1000 - based on $3.33 per gallon. This means all the food has a fuel cost of 2.5 cents per pound. Now, if the price of diesel DOUBLES, the fuel cost per pound is still only 5 cents per pound. This is insignificant if the load consists of such things as cornflakes which have 3 cents of corn in a $3.00 box. So, even if fossil fuels are rationed by price, the market will still be able to absorb an increased cost for fuel. Thus, all the whining we hear about fuel prices from the trucking and food industries are based on something else.<br><br>This something else is leveraging. In other words, the 2.5 cents is inflated in value during the transport, especially since the 1500 miles is in several segments. It is likely this 2.5 cents for fuel cost is leveraged into 25 cents or more by the time it gets to the consumer. However, this leveraging effect also provides a "cushion" that can be compressed. It is not outside the realm of probability that as fuel prices increase, there will still be plenty of food distributed through the global and national network. Shipping companies, whether by land or sea will likely be able to pass on their costs and STILL maintain their trade routes. There will be a shakeout, no doubt in those companies who are inefficient (in the modern business model sense), but those companies willing to take a 5% cut in profits should thrive.<br><br>I see peasant revolutions and catastrophic weather events in third-world countries having a greater impact on food distribution than the price of fuel. It pains me to say this, since I am a small-scale sustainable farmer, but the demographics of the situation dwarf all our good intentions.<br><br><a href=#c8064119772192315551 title="comment permalink">12/23/10, 10:36 AM</a><br><br>

So, like all these things, the most helpful approach is to be a part of your community in the large sense (not just the greenie subcommunity that is a small minority in the vast majority of the U.S.). As the need rises, the information will be sought out, and the knowledgeable people near at hand will help change the world... one skillet at a time. <br><br>What is thought of as traditional down-home food in these parts, however, has been HEAVILY contaminated by the long-persisting universal availability of fat and sugar that were once (and someday again will be) precious luxuries. There's hardly a single thing you can find in the "home cooking" spectrum here that is not loaded with butter and sugar (or margarine and corn syrup). It will be a bit of a shock for the "down home" flavor palettes here to adjust to the inherent tastes of food that are not piled deep under sugar, salt, fat, and bacon. I think people might mourn the loss of this almost as much as they will mourn the loss of their hugely overpowered pickups.<br><br><a href=#c4523394943137861534 title="comment permalink">12/23/10, 10:38 AM</a><br><br>

Some of you who cook from scratch, as I do, may find it useful.<br><br>The Rice Bowl as Metaphor 1-13-10<br><br>Asian meals can assume the properties of the “Rice Bowl”. This is traditionally seen as a bowl of steamed rice with a side dish laid on top and a garnish. For example a few slices of meat and a few slivers of green onion. A splash of soy sauce and you are good to go, a meal in a bowl.<br>As preppers we are concerned about nutrition but also about efficiency of food storage and food preparation. Also looming in the back of our minds is that elephant in the room: “appetite fatigue”.<br><br>With mostly beans and rice and maybe wheat stored in buckets piled to the ceiling we feel secure in our ability to feed ourselves and others until we can get our gardens, trees, flocks, &amp;c fully operational and self sustaining. But until then, there is, in the back of our minds that subtle tug of doubt that worries us a little about food variety if the moose finally sinks.<br><br>Sure we may have cans of sardines, tuna or smoked oysters by the dozen. But those cases of spam still stare dolefully down at you whenever you peruse your storage shelves. “How are you going to eat me?” they mutter, “You’ll get tired of me sooner or later!” You turn away in haste, turning out the light like some child running from a dark room.<br><br>Well, may I offer a gallant knight to help thwart the evil dragon we tend not to face; The Rice Bowl as Metaphor.<br><br>The rice bowl is a metaphor if we choose it to be. The rice in the bowl can be substituted out to be a multitude of things. Usually we think of starches, Steamed or fried potatoes, sprouted boiled wheat, bulgur (steamed cracked wheat), corn mush, broken crackers, boiled barley, boiled dry beans, fresh peas. You get the idea.<br>On top you can place almost anything that gives the meal a counterpoint, sometimes shaking hands with the underlying layer, sometimes fighting madly. It doesn’t need to be meat or fish, though that tends to be traditional. Sometimes you don’t have any meat or tofu. All you might have is some toasted root you experimented with, or a pickled something.<br>Remember, just like “three logs make a fire” “three counterpoints make a meal”. A few examples:<br>A bowl of cave beans (you have discovered cave beans haven’t you?) with two fried eggs and a braised scallion on top.<br>Boiled barley with a small fried fish or two and a scoop of steamed greens and a splash of soy and wine vinegar.<br>Rice and lentils with fried onion slices on top next to sliced pickled peppers.<br>Chopped bread in a bowl with sardines and shredded cabbage or sauerkraut on top. Drizzle with oil and vinegar.<br>Cold boiled potatoes with pickled beets and hard boiled eggs. Sprinkle with thyme or dill &amp;c.<br><br>Here is an interesting trick to add variety to your meals. Make three lists. On your first list write down as many things you can think of for your bowl’s “bulk” rice, barley &amp;c. For your second list write down your first counterpoint, anchovies, beef, cheese, &amp;c. Your third list should contain something more odd or flamboyant, your counterspice; onion or pepper or pickle. Let your imagination run wild. If you are adventurous (life, love and cooking should be approached with abandon), you can make a fourth list of adjuvants: sprinkles or sauces. Soy, various vinegars, oils, fruit juices (citrus, apple, prune) or shaved fruits (dried or fresh), crushed pan toasted nuts &amp;c.<br>Next take out dice and roll them. Or ask someone for a number between one and X, or put numbered slips of paper in a bag. The number that comes up is used to pick out the items on the list. Roll the dice for each list and see what dinner combination you come up with. The result is usually unique and often something you would never put together by thinking. Often it is delicious and a good discovery is made.<br><br><a href=#c407188798697323058 title="comment permalink">12/23/10, 11:27 AM</a><br><br>

Often, boxes of hay were used. Thus, the Wikipedia article noted below, “Haybox,” is the same thing as a “Fireless Cooker.”<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haybox<br><br>This is also discussed in older editions (perhaps up until 1950 or so) of the Girl Scout Handbook, which is available on Project Gutenberg. It was expected that a Girl Scout be able to construct a Fireless Cooker and prepare a meal with it (this is around page 112 in the Project Gutenberg edition), as well as other (mostly) lost arts of the old-time kitchen and home, such as the “Iceless Refrigerator” (page 116), which is an arrangement to keep food somewhat cool in the summer by way of damp cloths and evaporation.<br><br>We will likely need these skills again.<br><br>http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28490<br><br><a href=#c5607693995325083061 title="comment permalink">12/23/10, 12:43 PM</a><br><br>

I can't see doing it any other way. The only recent exception is when I've taught evening classes; then and only then have I relied on microwave-ready meals. When I have to do that, I try to get the best I can. The ones from Amy's Kitchen are about the best available, and they are bland-tasting, too.

Having someone to cook and to eat with goes a long, long way toward motivating one to 'eat in.' <br><br>My partner and I live about 2/3rds of the time in the middle of New York City and rarely go out to eat or get take-out. Cooking and eating together every night is a central pillar of our great relationship (as it was for my whole family most of the time growing up). Sure, the pressures on time and the ostensibly attractive 'alternatives' to eating-in in NYC are great, but it really doesn't take much to do a little planning in advance and cook every night. People say, "Well, I/we just don't have the time!" all the time to me. There is a simple answer- get rid of your TV- make cooking and eating together as a family the central part of each evening instead of staring dumbly at a flashing box.<br><br>My perennial cookbook recommendation is 'The Silver Spoon,' a tome of very, very simple yet usually very good classic Italian recipes. An easy, delicious recipe can be found in that book using nearly any vegetable, even the 'unusual' ones, that might be found in abundance at the farmer's market. Whenever we get a veg from our CSA and wonder, 'what the heck do we do with this?'

Thank you to all who posted about your own cooking from scratch; it's very encouraging to hear that I'm not a lone voice boiling beans in the wilderness, so to speak. Thanks also to those who recommended specific books! Given the flurry of responses, I trust nobody will mind if I limit my responses to those who had specific questions to ask or points to raise. <br><br>Cherokee, a "chicken tender" is a strip of chicken breast meat, sans skin and bone, breaded and deep fried at the factory and then shipped to food service establishments, where it can be heated up in a microwave or on a steam table. They're usually heavy on the salt and seasonings, to cover up the fact that they're basically tasteless chunks of vaguely meat-shaped plastic. <br><br>Luna, stand by for the next two posts. <br><br>Downshifting, spices were imported to medieval Europe by the time of the Crusades, so I'm guessing that some brave souls will get a spice trade going again fairly quickly if it stops at any point during the decline. Mind you, there are also some very good flavoring plants -- herbs, peppers, you name it -- that you can grow in your own garden, and it's a good thing to do!<br><br>H, I saw that. The idea that placebos are getting more effective over time has dizzying implications. <br><br>Marielar, I've been saying all along that bulk grains and legumes need to be grown in the kind of quantities that take significant acreage, and those who don't plan on becoming full time farmers need to have trades that will enable them to buy their grains and legumes from farmers. <br><br>Ivan, I was hoping somebody would notice that reference and ask. I'll be doing a post about fireless cookers next week, and will cover all the details then. <br><br>Karim, I think it's mostly an American bad habit to eat food that's produced in factories rather than the kitchen at home. Still, you've made a good point about local sources of food -- as things come apart, people in Mauritius and a lot of similar places are going to have to get local food production up and running in a hurry. <br><br>Ivy, next time one of them says that about sticking with you in the apocalypse, ask what useful skills they're prepared to offer to make them worth having around. The reaction may be interesting!<br><br>Walter, this is why purely economic factors are not a valid basis for decision making at this point -- they only price in short term costs. One of the points I've been trying to make is that green wizards (and others!) might want to consider spending that little bit more in order to support a local producer.<br><br><a href=#c7082030645593439492 title="comment permalink">12/23/10, 6:25 PM</a><br><br>

American cooking has been high on carbs and fats since colonial times, and there's a reason for that -- if you don't have those monster trucks, and have to put out a lot more muscular energy, fats and carbs make good fuel.<br><br>Jennie, excellent! If you can teach basic cooking skills to those who don't know how to do anything but microwave a plastic packet, a great deal of good could be done. <br><br>Emily, if I had Puritan tendencies, the nonsense that appears on the Food Channel would be one of my nominees for Satan incarnate. <br><br>Shiva, as mentioned in the post, I think fad diets are a great idea, since the human body benefits from changing its diet regularly. As for raw foods, most traditional cuisines include them; I grew up eating a certain amount of such delicacies as raw octopus sushi, for example, and I've enjoyed steak tartare as well as the more usual raw fruits, vegetables, etc. <br><br>Castanea, thank you for the Girl Scout Handbook reference! Yes, a fireless cooker is the same thing as a haybox, or rather a haybox is a relatively simple kind of fireless cooker. We'll be discussing those at great length in next week's post. <br><br>Robert, there's a great Russian proverb: "Don't let the perfect become the enemy of the possible." Most people don't have the option of slaughtering their own hogs -- though I do grow some of my own beans. As for the soup, it's not heatless at all; again, I'll be discussing fireless cookers next week. <br><br>Richard, now you've made me hungry -- not easy, after the very tasty shepherd's pie that was the centerpiece of tonight's dinner, but that grouse sounds good. As for your hunting technique, well, friends of mine have returned from deer camp more than once with the sheepish confession that the only deer they bagged was the one that mashed in the front grill of the pickup...<br><br>DaShui, er, first of all, Druids don't have popes, and if we did I wouldn't be it. As for the rest, well, I talk about the things I want to talk about when I want to talk about them; if you'd like to see a blog post about some other subject, I encourage you to start a blog of your own!<br><br><a href=#c1708853072709316579 title="comment permalink">12/23/10, 6:41 PM</a><br><br>

If Sally was fed tenders and jojos as a tot, wouldn't they still trigger a visceral comfort response, even if she grew up to value greens and beans?<br><br>Food is far more than nutrition, but a vehicle for love to get passed around the table. Really, all those plants and meals are sponges, soaking up our intentions and care (or not) which become another vital component of our fulfillment.<br><br>I learned this cooking at a more enlightened restaurant, ironically enough, which usually had a line out the door. One busy, crazy breakfast rush I became so visibly flustered that I was yanked off the line, pushed into the "safety area" and encouraged to chill out. Only good attitudes were allowed around the food; take a break and shift it, then try again. A revelation to me then...<br> <br>Life in the mad oil bubble has out-sourced more than nutriment; food has not only gained vast toxicity, but has largely been eliminated as a channel for strengthening mental and emotional health. Something we will need as surely as carbohydrates and spice as we mourn the losses of the day.<br><br>Good cooking IS good knitting; it's a thread that weaves your loved ones together into a deeper, stronger garment, one to warm both body and soul on a cold winter's night.<br><br><a href=#c4620146198887418037 title="comment permalink">12/24/10, 6:21 AM</a><br><br>

They carry a lot of air ("sailboat fuel") both inside the packaging and in the unoccupied trailer space. Plus that finished consumer good has travelled first from its international primary producer to the port, then from the port to the processing plant (where it is met by packaging that has followed a similarly circuitous route), then from the plant to the distribution center, then to the retail outlet, and finally from the retail outlet to the home in the private vehicle (that last leg, by the way, contributes about half the total fuel consumption of the entire trip). So fuel per pound of ready-to-eat food on the table is considerably higher than the back-of-the-envelope estimate based on full trucks hauling bulk commodities. <br><br>JMG -- re: fat and sugar, there has been a steady creep upward in the calorie density of the American diet over many decades; what is eaten now is much fattier and more sugared than what was eaten even a generation ago, thanks to ubiquitous corn and soybeans. Our "bread" is almost like the "cake" of a couple of generations ago. Combine that with the steady drop in physical activity, and no one should be surprised at the trends in obesity and its related health issues!<br><br>I have seen some historical movie footage shot in this town in the 1940s and 1950s.

There are: tractors; fertilisers; on farm vehicles; transport to markets and distribution centres; processing; cool storage; transport to the end retailer or market.

Make no mistake people, we are eating oil and coal.<br><br>Hi mistah charley,<br><br>Microwave ovens use less energy than an electric stove top however, it's not much less and I don't consider it to be efficient enough to use for more than a minute or two. I have a microwave oven rated at 700w output but when you look at the actual energy used it is closer to 2,000w because of the magnatrons inefficency. Being on off grid solar you keep an eye on everything in the household. <br><br>An electric stove top will use about the same amount of energy as the microwave oven, but you have the option of turning on more than one element which multiplies the load. They are usually connected up on their own heavy duty circuit.<br><br>It's a useful exercise to think of how you would cook without electricity, natural gas, lpg etc. We have a wood backup for everything.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><a href=#c7882305470760877074 title="comment permalink">12/25/10, 11:54 PM</a><br><br>

When faced with the problem of cooking fast and healthy and saving energy and money, the answer was simple - pressure cooker. Pressure cookers reduce cooking time to 30% of what is necessary in conventional cooking, and energy consumption to 25% of energy consumed in conventional cooking. These are massive savings whatever kind of energy you use: electricity, gas or wood. I have two preassure cookers, small one (2,5 liters) made of black cast iron and big one (7 liters) made of stainless steel. They are made by two well-known German companies but I shall not give the name of the companies because it is obvious to me that most of The Archdruid Report readers are from US and there is no need to buy imported products and make more people unemployed and homeless. I am sure there are dozens of companies in US that make pressure cookers. <br><br>Pressure cookers are great for any kind of soups. There is minimum quantity of liquid (one cup) necessary to produce pressure and maximum is about two thirds of net volume. When making dishes with meat you first cook meat for abour 20 minutes, than decompress the pot, add vegetables and cook 5 minutes more. With big pressure cooker that way you can cook dishes in quantities that you shall keep in cold and eat following day(s). Pressure cookers are great for Central European dishes like Hungarian Gulash, all kinds of chicken and turkey paprikash, thick soups, sauerkraut, etc. These dishes ususally taste better following day(s). For the simplest pudding (without added sugar) you can take cubes of the big orange colored pumpkin (I do not know how it is called in English) and in several minutes it is soft healthy delicious dessert. Otherwise you need to bake pumpking for a long time in the oven.<br><br>There is one drawback of the pressure cooker. It relies on some kind of rubber gasket and springs to keep pressure inside. These parts have finite life and unless you are sure that spares will be available for many years you better buy quantity of spares with the pressure cooker itself. <br><br>If you have more money to invest and do not want cookware with spare parts to replace there is ultimate in simplicity, reliability, durability and energy efficiency, particulary for the people living in US. Company named Calphalon manufacture infused anodized aluminum cookware. The pot is made of several milimeters thick aluminium. Infused anodization is what makes it more expensive. Aluminium conducts heat so well that walls of the pot contribute to heating just as much as the bottom. I suggest bit (8 qt.) stockpot because it allows you to cook bulky vegetables like cabbage.<br><br>Now that I know what fireless cooker is I can not see reason why I should not save energy both during heating of the pot and after heating by putting it inside fireless cooker.<br><br><a href=#c1000091918886278306 title="comment permalink">12/26/10, 3:16 AM</a><br><br>

To make it, you first have to bake a pan of cornbread -- then you crumble that up with sauteed onions and celery and such, and bake it again. Anyway, that recipe makes sense in a society that eats a lot of cornbread -- it's a way of using up leftover cornbread. Much the same is true of the pain perdu and bread pudding of my native Louisiana; they're ways of using up leftover French bread in a society that's always eating a lot of it. And of course, boiling bones and scraps for soup stock is a very common way of getting a good meal out of the leavings of another good meal. . .<br><br>A number of down-home recipes originated as ways to make use of the leftovers and byproducts from other down-home recipes. They make the most sense, not as something you might knock together once a year, but as a sort of byproduct of cooking with a region's traditional ingredients every day. All the more reason to cook that way every day, if possible.<br><br><a href=#c5236501886169255909 title="comment permalink">12/26/10, 11:58 AM</a><br><br>

Guy</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>John, your belief "...that making a good meal should take no more of my time ... than the fifteen minutes or so it takes me to eat the result..." was refreshing to see from another mind. I've said similar to family and friends to be met with questioning of the soundness of my reasoning and sometimes even confrontation as if I had thus insulted some fundamental value of decent humanity (as if it were necessary for the well-being of a civilized human to spend at least a multiple of the time it may take to eat a meal, in its preparation)<br>You bring to my mind the cooking adventures I've grown from the images left over in my mind of things read or observed over the years and almost never informed by recipes written down or passed by word of mouth. I may think that I remembered seeing someone cook something a certain way once and as long as it seems like it won't make me sick then off I go to try it. The most enduring of my personal adventures, and also the most varying, has been abandoning soup as a specific list of ingredients cooked in a specific way for a specific time and redefining it for myself as "edible things prepared in water commonly eaten with a spoon". My largest pot finds itself almost perpetually filled with this kind of soup. The soup does not get completely eaten in a meal and is added to for the next. Friends have asked "What's for dinner?" then "What kind of soup" and the only thorough answer is to dip a bowl from the pot and fish around in it to see what you've got but I can say with certainly that it is dominated by legumes, potatoes, rice or similar and if I happened to have beets on hand it will be a deep red. If other vegetables are hard to come by affordably it may find itself dominated by sauerkraut. If it has been a while since the sauerkraut was last added then I find that an unprepared palate will call it bland regardless of the array of flavors provided by things like radish greens, dandelion leaves or any strongly flavored vegetables. At times it may even appear little more than deep colored thickened water with leaves and bits of meat and mushy beans settled in it but the flavor is there, rich and varying. The bean paste I enjoy, simple dried beans kept in water and heated on occasion until they turn to mush just by stirring them then built up with a few spices or whatever else seems good at the time, is also called bland by members of my family who have grown up on the industrial diet and follow after it unquestionedly because the ingredients of a jar of industrially manufactured bean dip product seem not unusual in listing 7% daily sodium intake (2,000 calorie diet) for two tablespoons.<br><br><a href=#c8388158252880195649 title="comment permalink">12/27/10, 8:01 AM</a><br><br>

Its relative ease, enormous everyday practicality - most people eat three meals in a day - and great potential for creativity has helped keep it relevant and even fashionable at a time when other skills have been forgotten. <br><br>Which is not to say that peak oil won't impact the way we cook. Of course it will. It already is - offal is reappearing in mainstream supermarkets (at least where I live) and the menus in restaurants and pubs up and down the country are changing as the transport and supply costs of food hit their profit margins. But I submit that the arts of cooking are remembered and used by a great enough percentage of the population that it's a living, not dying, skill.<br><br>I personally really like cooking because it's one of the few things we still learn as a <i>skill</i>, not some hopelessly over-analysed academic torture exercise. Novice cooks aren't drilled in the different oven temperatures for birds or for biscuits; no one tries to explain how to make jam with pictures of its microscopic structure. You're given raw ingredients and you work them with simple tools not much different - mostly - to those used two hundred years ago, or two thousand. You stir and flip and poke your makings, you experiment with herbs and sauces and seasonings, and the end result may be delightful, or may be horrific, but it's always individual. <br><br>I am not convinced that the fading of the industrial world will be particularly good for people's diets, or the art of cooking as a whole. We're lucky enough to live in a time of unimaginable abundance and variety, and while certainly overindulgence has caused some people illness, there's also been a real explosion of creativity in cooking. Nowadays we have the luxury of eating the things we <i>choose</i> to eat, rather than what's available or affordable. Most peasants - and in a non-industrial world, most people will be peasants - live on much poorer and blander fare, with cooking and recipes aimed at maximising calories, not delighting the tastebuds.<br><br><a href=#c5926041957498280622 title="comment permalink">12/27/10, 1:50 PM</a><br><br>

It is a better resource than any I've seen on how to adjust to the ingredients, fuel, and especially time available, and it produces better bread with less work than Tassajara recipes or any from my family. Partly, this is because Robertson drew on very deep traditions, including apprenticeships in rural France, but has gracefully adapted them to his own time and place. I decided not to buy the book, but I got a lot out of reading it; I hope there's a paperback edition in the works, with more memoir/how-to spirit, and less coffee table book/intimidating gourmet attitude.<br><br>A great how-to on cuisine-building is Carol Deppe's latest book, <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Resilient-Gardener-Production-Self-Reliance-Uncertain/dp/160358031X/ rel=nofollow>The Resilient Gardener</a>. She has gone so far as to breed vegetables for less time- and energy-intensive preparation, but a good third of the book focuses on attitudes toward cooking and food storage that would be helpful even for those who live in studio apartments.<br><br>Last, there are a lot of good web log resources on this topic. An ongoing feature I enjoy is the "Bean Fest" series at &lt;a href="http://www.homegrownevolution.com/search/label/bean%20fest&gt;Homegrown Evolution&lt;/a&gt;.

I still say that the time I spent as a cook during my collegiate years may have been just as important as the degree I earned from the institution of higher education. In the end knowing how to use a knife, boil, bake, grill, sauté, and stew are but a few of the important culinary survival skills required for what lies ahead. <br><br>My wife and I cook all of our food from scratch, and while we try our best to produce as much as we can through our gardens, fruit trees, bees, and chickens, the limits of our 1 acre property require us to purchase items that we simply do not have the space to grow. While we have had excellent luck with sourcing local meat, dairy, and produce, we have had some difficulty with finding local grains. Luckily I think we have found the solution to that as well and will be going up to Pennsylvania tomorrow to investigate (we live in extreme northern MD, about 1.5 miles from the MD/PA border). Being avid hikers, we have tried to source our food to farms and producers that are no greater than a two-day hike from our home. This way we only need our legs, a backpack, and a good sturdy pair of boots to get what we need in the event of system failure. Thinking ahead we even have winter foot travel taken care of as we both gave each other snowshoes, among other homemade items, for our Yule/Alban Arthuan celebration this year!<br><br>I think the points being made about alternate cooking sources are important as well. We have been experimenting with a solar cooker and have started to achieve excellent results with recipes that one would traditionally place into a crock pot or pressure cooker. While you have to plan ahead a bit with it because of increased cooking time, it allows you to prepare a meal in a few minutes, set it out into the sun, and pretty much forget about it until it is time to eat. The nice thing about the solar oven is that it will not burn the food so you can go away all day long and come home to a piping hot meal. <br><br>As for old recipe books, my favorite is the one I inherited from my great grandmother, who remains one of my main inspirations for my sustainability desires, simple lifestyle, and believe it or not, my Druid path. This amazing woman, who grew up during the Depression years, taught me, among other things, the arts of canning, cooking, pickling, and gardening to name but a few. Even as she was getting up into her early nineties, I still fondly recall her out in her garden, speaking to her plants and working with the earth. The cookbook she left me has tattered pages, and a black spiral binding, the best kind. The wealth of recipes and knowledge enshrined in this book is simply magnificent and it has provided many excellent meals throughout my life. The recipes work great in the solar oven, and were meant to be prepared quickly with whatever materials were available on hand. I am in the process of typing up this cookbook so that others can share in her wisdom and would be happy to forward it along to all those interested when I am finished. Actually, I think I might link to it in the Green Wizards forum as soon as I am through, which should be in a couple more weeks.<br><br><a href=#c1844598395802638674 title="comment permalink">12/27/10, 7:48 PM</a><br><br>

Sure it's something that home-scale growers are completely out of the habit of... but people have been doing this (on a small scale) since about 10,000 years ago all over the world with good success -- about 9,900 of those years without petroleum assistance. Sure there have been famines -- and there still are even in the petroleum era. But the fact is that it isn't rocket science. It's just work; a lot of work, but nothing more than most people can actually manage just fine. Field corn grows pretty much just like sweet corn, you just need to tend whole lot more of it. Turnips, potatoes, what have you -- same deal. Tend your soil, tend your plants, harvest your crop.<br><br><a href=#c6340904273445877065 title="comment permalink">12/27/10, 8:50 PM</a><br><br>

The load from items on standby can be quite significant and over time and place an unnecessary strain on the batteries - especially over winter.<br><br>Anyway on standby the microwave oven uses 2.5 watts of energy per hour. So, over the course of a year this equates to 21,900 watts of energy per hour (ie. 21.9kW/h)- just on standby.<br><br>However, when it is operating on "high - the oven is rated as 700 watts cooking output on the front panel", it uses 1,610 watts per hour. <br><br>If you somehow "saved" the energy from the standby mode over the course of a year (ie. 21.9kW/h), you could convert that to 13.6 hours of cooking on the high setting.<br><br>The end result is... Turn it off at the wall as you're probably paying for it and it's not doing anything particularly useful for the energy consumed!<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><a href=#c4907462775232981396 title="comment permalink">12/28/10, 12:26 AM</a><br><br>

As we get deeper into the peak oil period and a growing body of people are forced to cook for themselves there will be a considerable increase in the waste of raw food stuffs; whether animal or vegetable. By your description as large collection of people are complete amateurs when it comes to cooking from scratch. They don't know how to handle the raw materials, buy appropriately or process it effectively. Thus, there will be a great deal of food wasted.<br><br><a href=#c8129787765546141576 title="comment permalink">12/28/10, 12:33 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_b6373a" id=c5933844544645235043></div><b><a href=http://openid.aol.com/joanhello rel=nofollow>Joan</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>It is my experience that convenience food is not really about saving labor or saving time; it's about minimizing the amount of thought that needs to go into food preparation, particularly the amount of planning and remembering. Having a bowl of beans soaking or a stew in the slow cooker means that a dinner is going to be ready within a known time frame at a particular location and someone needs to be there to finish it and serve it. This adds a bit of time pressure to the schedule, and when people feel as if they're already under as much time pressure as they can stand, meal planning can start to look downright onerous. Households where multiple jobs and multiple kids are being juggled are particularly liable to fall into the fast food habit, and worse: adults' meals replaced with one of those "nutrition bar" type things, or skipped altogether in favor of errands and extra work. In 2006, when Michael Pollan wrote <i>The Omnivore's Dilemma</i>, 19% of American meals were eaten in cars, carooming from the day job to the younger kid's day care to the older one's Little League practice to the moonlighting job with only a brief stop at home, and the number has probably risen since then, at least in those areas of the country that aren't on their knees economically. Pollan pointed out that the success of fast food is related to the fact that it is designed to be eaten with one hand, the other presumably being employed in steering. "This is the genius of the chicken nugget: It liberated chicken from the fork and the plate, making it as convenient, waste-free and automobile-friendly as the precondimented hamburger."<br><br><a href=#c5933844544645235043 title="comment permalink">12/28/10, 7:51 PM</a><br><br>

On our 8 acres we're not willing to cut down enough of our woods to grow field crops. Our immediate plan for decline is plant more potatoes. Our long term response would involve share-cropping land currently in grass hay and getting a cow. There's also the likelihood of adjacent properties, some of whom have absentee owners, being available for cultivation with or without official santion.<br><br>Glenn,<br><br>Marrowstone Island<br><br><a href=#c4281424699950201929 title="comment permalink">12/29/10, 9:07 AM</a><br><br>
