Like any other movement in contemporary society, the peak oil scene now and again has to take time away from addressing the challenges that have brought it into being in order to sort out its own internal vagaries. One timely example was the fluttering in several different dovecotes following longtime peak oil stalwart Matt Savinar’s <a href=http://www.lifeaftertheoilcrash.net/BreakingNews.html>decision</a> to shut down his forum and news blog, in order to refocus his energies on a new career as an astrologer.<br><br>It’s a curious detail of sociology that people who hold one set of beliefs that are stigmatized by society – those people who hope to become respectable one of these days, at least – tend to distance themselves reflexively from those who hold unrelated but equally stigmatized beliefs. In most corners of American society today, the reality of hard ecological limits has about the same cachet as the ancient belief that events here on earth are foreshadowed by changes in the circling heavens. Actually, that understates the case. Plenty of people who regularly sneak glances at newspaper horoscope columns are quick to reject any suggestion that the march of progress could be stopped in its tracks by nature’s callous refusal to provide us with as much cheap concentrated energy as we happen to want. Thus it’s no surprise that most of the responses to Savinar’s announcement were negative.<br><br>Still, Savinar may have the last laugh. An article in <a href=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703989004575653102537901956.html>Tuesday’s Wall Street Journal</a> discussed the way that old-fashioned Southern conjure – also known as rootwork or hoodoo, the traditional magic of African-American folk culture – has become a growth industry while the rest of the economy is circling the drain. While the New Age movement is very much a creature of prosperous times, old-fashioned occultism has always tended to swim against the current of the business cycle, prospering in hard times and finding fewer takers when the economy booms. If the current economic unraveling has the usual effects, Savinar may just have made an exceptionally smart career move.<br><br>At the same time, there’s more to the matter than one person pursuing a marketable skill in whose relevance and efficacy, by the way, he wholeheartedly believes. Just prior to the shutdown of the “Life After The Oil Crash” forum, Savinar posted a series of increasingly irritated comments about the number of people on it whose obsessive concern about the prospect of a catastrophic future stopped well short of doing anything to prepare for it. I know the feeling; this blog and the <a href=http://www.greenwizards.org/ >Green Wizards forum</a> have attracted a lot of people who are actually doing something about their future, but I’ve had plenty of run-ins elsewhere with people who apparently believe that (a) insisting that some technology they’re doing nothing to develop or deploy will bail us out of our predicament, (b) displaying their doombat machismo by imagining a future more godawful than anybody else’s, or (c) finding somebody to blame and showing Jung a thing or two about how to project the shadow, are useful responses to the end of the industrial age.<br><br>Unproductive as these habits may be, there’s an understandable logic behind them, and behind all the attempts to paint the future in glowing colors of one sort or another – be those colors the syrupy hues of a Thomas Kinkade cottage painting or the purer if less comforting tones of a thermonuclear fireball. All of these portraits are ways not to think about the future that’s actually bearing down on us, a future that might best be summed up by pointing out that nearly all of us here in America will be poor – not "can’t afford the latest Xbox this month" poor, by the way, but "may not be able to put food on the table" poor – for the rest of our lives.<br><br>Yes, it really is as simple as that. White’s Law defines energy per capita as the basic measurement of economic development; as energy per capita declines, the economy contracts, and its capacity to support individuals at any level above the starvation line contracts as well. All the social, political, and military fireworks that punctuate the curve of decline unfold from that inescapable equation, as those who can no longer support themselves by supporting the system turn to catabolizing the system as a matter of sheer survival. Just now the turn to catabolism is happening in a shamefaced, surreptitious way: thieves stripping empty homes for copper and aluminum, banks cashing in their futures to buy short-term cash flow, cities quietly announcing that this or that set of essential services will no longer be available. Later rounds of catabolism may be a good deal more direct; each new round of news stories about the struggles between warlords beyond America’s fortified southern frontier makes me think of the proud border chieftains of an earlier age: Alaric, Hengist, Genseric, Attila.<br><br>Such reflections may make the green wizardry I’ve been discussing in recent posts seem pointless, but that pointlessness is an illusion. If the great driving force behind a future of disintegration and chaos is the simple inability of a failing society to provide even the most basic subsistence for the bulk of its people, anything that will allow those people to make other arrangements for their subsistence offers a way to cushion the decline. With that in mind, I want to talk about a simple, resilient technology that helps solve several of the most serious problems that poor people face now and the rest of us will be facing shortly. It was common – in fact, heavily promoted – all over the industrial world a century ago, and you’ve probably never heard of it.<br><br>Let’s start with the problem: cooking fuel. According to a recent news story, archeologists have found out that our sturdy cousins the Neanderthals routinely ate cooked vegetables, and cooked meat has been a hominid staple since the days of Homo erectus. <i>Pace</i> today’s raw food diet promoters, most foodstuffs are safer to eat and easier to digest when they’ve been subjected to heat, which is why every human culture everywhere on earth cooks most meals. The one drawback is that the heat has to come from somewhere, and usually that involves burning some kind of fuel; anywhere outside today’s industrial world, fuel doesn’t come cheap, and in most poor countries the struggle to find enough fuel to cook with is a major economic burden, not to mention a driving force behind deforestation and other ecological crises.<br><br>The obvious response, if you happen to think the way people in the modern industrial world think, is to deal with fuel shortages by finding and burning more fuel. That’s exactly the thinking that got us into our current predicament, though, so it’s worth looking at other options. To do that, we need to start with the thermodynamics of cooking itself.<br><br>Imagine, then, a saucepan on the stove cooking rice. It’s a metal container with a heat source under it, and inside it are two cups of water and a cup of grass seeds – that’s "rice" to you and me; the goal of the operation is to get enough heat and moisture into the grass seeds that your digestive system can get at the starches, sugars, B vitamins, and other nutritious things inside them. So far, so good, but this is where a familiarity with the laws of thermodynamics comes in handy, because there’s a prodigious waste of energy going on.<br><br>Trace the energy along its route and you can watch the waste happen. The energy at the heat source is highly concentrated; it flows, with some losses, into the metal saucepan; some of it flows through the pan to the water and rice, where it does the job of cooking, but a great deal of the heat gets into the sides and lid of the pan; some of it comes directly through the substance of the pan, some of it comes indirectly through the water and rice, but one way or another a great deal of the energy in your cooking fuel is being used to warm the surrounding air. This is all the more wasteful in that your rice doesn’t need a huge amount of heat once the water’s been brought to a boil; a very gentle simmer is more than enough, but to produce that gentle simmer a lot of fuel gets burnt and a lot of heat wasted.<br><br>Here’s an experiment for you to try. Get a cork mat larger than the bottom of the saucepan you use to cook rice, and a tea cozy. What’s a tea cozy? An insulated cover for a teapot, designed to keep the tea in the pot good and hot while you work your way down from the first relatively pallid cups off the top to the stuff with the color and consistency of road tar down at the very bottom. The kind of tea cozy you want has a slit in one side for the handle of the teapot, and one opposite it for the spout, and it needs to be large enough to pop over the saucepan with the saucepan’s handle sticking out through one of the slits; the more insulation it has, the better..<br><br>Got it? Okay, get your pot of rice started; when the water has reached a good fierce boil and you’ve put the rice in, cover the saucepan tightly, take it off the heat, put it on the cork mat and pop the tea cozy over it. Leave it for a little longer than you would normally keep it on the stove, and then serve; if you’ve followed the instructions, you should have perfectly cooked rice with a fraction of the fuel consumption you’d otherwise have had.<br><br>If you’ve done the experiment, you’ve just learned the principle behind the fireless cooker. In America, those were often called "hayboxes," because that’s what the old-fashioned version was – a wooden box stuffed full of hay in such a way that there was a space for a pot in the middle, and a pillow of cotton ticking stuffed with more hay that went over the top. A hundred years ago, though, you could get elegant models from department stores that had porcelain-coated steel cases, rock wool insulation, and easy-to-clean metal liners with pots sized to fit; the best models had soapstone disks you could stick in the oven during the day’s baking, then drop into the fireless cooker, put a pot of soup or stew on top, and have it piping hot for dinner six hours later.<br><br>I’ve never seen an old-fashioned fireless cooker; my guess is that here in America, at least, most of them were turned in during the big scrap metal drives in the Second World War. They were apparently still in use in some corners of Europe in the 1940s and 1950s, Still, the technology is simple enough that even the least capable home craftsperson can put one together in an hour or two. My spouse and I have two of them, a portable version in a wooden box and a rather less portable version built into a piece of furniture; both of them were built using a slightly improved version of the basic haybox design with polyester quilt batting for the insulation and cotton ticking covering the batting to keep it clean. Doubtless the design could be improved, but the portable one holds heat well enough that a pot of Scotch oats, brought to a boil on an open fire and tucked into the cooker before going to bed, serves up piping hot oatmeal the next morning.<br><br>Fireless cookers will not save the world. They aren’t even a complete solution to the problem of finding adequate cooking fuel, though they make a good many other responses more viable by sharply cutting the amount of heat that has to be provided from some other source. In the jargon of the peak oil scene, they aren’t silver bullets, or even silver BBs; they’re simply a useful bit of appropriate tech that can be put to work in order to make an impoverished future a little easier to live with. There are many other things that can be put to work in the same way.<br><br>Come to think of it, that’s basically what human culture is – a bag of tricks, not unlike Felix the Cat’s, suited to the needs and possibilities of a particular suite of human ecologies. The culture we’ve grown up with was adapted to an environment in which, for most people in the industrial world, the big question was how to make the most use of cheap abundant fossil fuels. The culture our great-grandchildren will grow up with, in turn, will be adapted to an environment in which the big question will be how to manage a healthy and graceful existence on a very sparse resource base. Fireless cookers might well become a part of that culture of the not too distant future, particularly if enough green wizards check out the possibilities in haybox technology here and now.<br><br><span style=font-size:130%>Resources</span><br><br>Far and away the best book written on fireless cookers so far is Heidi Kirschner’s <i>Fireless Cookery</i>. Published by a small press in 1981, it’s long out of print; some small press could do a lot worse than hunt up the current copyright holder, get the rights, and put it back on the bookshelves.<br><br>I understand that Girl Scout handbooks from before 1950 or thereabouts have instructions for making a haybox, and might be worth consulting; there are also chapters on the technology in some American cookbooks from the first decade or so of the twentieth century.

(I'd tell you who coined the term if I could remember, but I do recall that the "weird thing" in question was long hair on men.) The basic idea was that people are more likely to overlook or forgive your "weird thing" if you only have one--unless you can combine them into another label. The example given was that "long haired guy" was one weird thing, but "hippie" was also only one weird thing, one which encompassed a lot more than hair. As a Druid, I'll bet you can get a lot of "weird things" for free!<br><br>As for the fireless cookers, I've been wanting to try those! I apparently hadn't considered the possibilities inherent in tea cozies. I've also been doing some quilting with worn-out clothes, and I have to wonder if customized "tea cozies" for my pots would do the trick. Would that be enough insulation for the larger pots, do you think? I may have to patchwork me up some denim cozies and try it!<br><br><a href=#c4880944661376411246 title="comment permalink">12/29/10, 9:18 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avtb a_60a81c" id=c6809923005501191315></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/04622195596387968961 rel=nofollow>Sean Strange</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>My question for John Michael is this: how is it that highly intelligent people can have such radically different ideas about what the future holds? It’s as if our species is on trial and the opposing lawyers are presenting two equally compelling cases, and we are the jury who must decide the fate of mankind. <br><br>On one side, we have folks like the Archdruid suggesting that our future will inevitably be marked by resource scarcity, for which we should be preparing to adapt now by relearning old technologies like hayboxes. Meanwhile, equally bright people on the other side are optimistic about our civilization’s prospects and insist that we must continue pushing forward and allow new technologies to work their magic. (For a good example of the latter, watch http://vimeo.com/18141726 for a broad overview of resource scarcity problems and a technologist/cornucopian approach to solving them)<br><br>I find both sides compelling, yet it’s clear that one (or both) must be very wrong. So I throw up my hands and do little until one side has been clearly vindicated, though I lean toward the cornucopians’ case since any long view of human history tends to support their side. Do you have any thoughts or advice?<br><br><a href=#c6809923005501191315 title="comment permalink">12/29/10, 9:36 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avtb a_61c74c" id=c6179748874203728362></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/02333438671130100114 rel=nofollow>Bill Pulliam</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Interesting coincidences of events. We've recently been watching the BBC series "The Duchess of Duke Street," produced in the 1970s and set in a very unromanticized version of the Edwardian years of the early 20th Century. The main character is that Era's version of a celebrity chef. In one episode they have a resource crunch and don't have the stoves to get everything ready at the same time. So she makes a bunch of hayboxes and uses them to cook some of the dishes in advance and keep them warm until serving time. Hers were shown as actual wooden boxes filled with hay (probably really straw). Before this I had never heard of such a contraption; and now just a week or two later here they are again in the Archdruid Report!<br><br> You can also use the haybox effect with a conventional oven -- preheat it a bit above the recommended cooking temp, put the food in, turn the oven off, leave it a little longer than the recommended cooking time, and in many cases it will be done just right! Experimentation is of course necessary. It works better on newer ovens that are more well insulated; it of course will not work at all with microwaves or toaster ovens. On the stovetop, pasta can often be cooked by just dumping it in the water, returning the water to a boil, then turning the stove off and covering the pot for a couple of minutes longer than the usual cooking time. So this particular trick can be put to use on a limited basis right now, without making or acquiring anything new.<br><br><a href=#c6179748874203728362 title="comment permalink">12/29/10, 9:40 PM</a><br><br>

I was made familiar with the concept a few years ago through a roommate who had one.

As for the tea cozy approach, yes, you can scale that up -- a fabric fireless cooker would work well. The book I cited has patterns for a backpacker's fireless cooker that you pack with dry leaves and the like when you reach camp each afternoon, tuck your breakfast into overnight, and then unpack and fold up the next morning. <br><br>Sean, I'm very familiar with the cornucopian approach. To my mind it rests on a total misunderstanding of the relative importance of energy resources, and other natural goods, as compared to human inputs into the economic process. They would doubtless say the same thing about my approach! The difference, though, is a matter of fundamental principles; their logic is as good as mine, it's simply that their presuppositions are (in my view) catastrophically flawed. I've covered all this in detail in <i>The Long Descent</i>, if you're interested in following it up. <br><br>Bill, true enough -- the same principle can be used in many different ways. I've never found a good way to cook pasta in a haybox -- the cooking process is so much more efficient that it always comes out mushy!<br><br><a href=#c8458470681264523114 title="comment permalink">12/29/10, 10:02 PM</a><br><br>

If you google haybox, as I did, you'll find actual, normal-sounding people writing blog posts about various attempts to make them, including one made with a towel, a pillowcase filled with foam peanuts, and an old metal box. So I don't think it's too weird of a thing. In our little apartment, the gas stove is free (included in rent), but I'm going to work on building my haybox anyway. My partner does woodworking, maybe I can convince him to build me a nice-looking one out of an old pallet.<br><br><a href=#c2520797775488659685 title="comment permalink">12/29/10, 10:39 PM</a><br><br>

A (relatively) warm kitchen is part of my heating strategy, an I try to get all of the rest of my work done earlier so I can spend my evenings in the in there preparing long-term foods and doing paperwork.

I have been bummed about Savinar bailing on his "Breaking News" but oh well. <br><br>As a fellow grad of LuckyMojo, I have been practicing and planning on making hoodoo as an integral part of religiomagical practice that will be a part of my sustenance as an elder. One of the things that one can continue to do into old age (since retirement is not in the cards for many of us). You gotta figure things out for one's old age (if we make it of course).<br><br>For the same reason, I took the Master Gardener coursework (to grow not only food and medicinal herbs, but magical herbs). Now hoodoo is good for lots of things as you know, focusing on human troubles and frailties (prosperity, love, etc.). <br><br>I am also studying cross-cultural agricultural fertility magic (planting by the signs, etc.)--I bet you have some good tips on this as Archdruid!<br><br>As far as cooking goes, when I was an itinerant archaeologist, I used to heat my field lunch up by setting my can/container o' stew on my old stationwagon dashboard, in that tight space between the dashboard and the window, parked facing the sun, and it was nice and hot by the time lunch came along. Junk cars can have their uses too, solar ovens and dehydrators.<br><br>Today I just baked my first loaf of bread I ever baked, using that no-knead recipe that works real nice. It came out pretty good, using a dutch oven. The crust was a little too hard/burnt in spots but the rest was great. <br><br>Learning to cook one-dish meals in a dutch oven is also a handy skill. You can layer the stew/beans underneath and the bread/biscuits on top. The miners used to have a dual layered metal container with hot tea in the lower reservoir and pasty in the upper basket (the tea would keep the pasty warm).<br><br><a href=#c8123915877813332476 title="comment permalink">12/29/10, 11:01 PM</a><br><br>

I felt I learned a lot about various past societies that I hadn't known much about before...such as the Greenland Norse, and I found some of his analyses of past societies informative. However, I found some of his overall conclusions problematic, particularly concerning our current civilization. He seemed too hopeful and optimistic. He also hardly mentioned peak oil, which seems to me of vital importance in any discussion of the future of industrial society.<br><br>I'm planning to start off the New Year by reading both Overshoot by William Catton and The Collapse of Complex Societies by Joseph Tainter (since I see so many make references to these books, I think I need to read them...)<br><br>By the way, JMG, do you know of any illustrated children's books that have a peak oil theme (more than in an indirect way?) Since I love to draw and write, one of my dreams is to illustrate/write a very whimsical, lighthearted children's book that has a peak oil theme (though I would try to not have the theme be too overt in the story...

Right before we all headed out, he would take some of those hot rocks and put them in the bottom of a haybox under a cast iron dutch oven and while we were out rounding up cattle, our lunch was cooking. After lunch he would do the same thing with new rocks and our supper would be cooking while we were out for the afternoon.<br><br>Thanks for bringing back those memories and for reminding me of that wonderful time.

The notion that anyone can predict the future of anyone else seems ludicrous as is the notion of any person being able to plot the influence of extra-terrestial bodies, some of which aren't even known about, on people's lives, when even scientists have difficulty solving equations to predict the exact orbits of those same bodies. He went from a well researched analysis of what peak oil will mean to something that seems so off topic that it's unreal. The idea that it might be a smart career move doesn't really hold water, for me, as Matt was forecasting a collapsing society, not just a difficult recession or depression. However, I suppose it might be a "skill" that some will demand. That would be sad indeed.<br><br>Now the idea of fireless cookers, on the other hand, is awesome. And you have two! Greedy.

As the tea cools I keep adding hot water from the thermos, and have a whole afternoon supply of hot tea for cold days. <br><br>I really want a solar cooker but I still can't decide which particular brand would be the best option. Deep but small, or larger but not as deep but with electric backup...?? Plus I have to get special pots for the cooker; I have cast iron and antique aluminum pots, neither of which work well in a solar cooker (which is mainly why mine is now a haybox). <br><br>I made a rocket stove which worked beautifully; they use MUCH less fuel than a traditional wood stove. You can't use it in the house though, but it is useful outside and you can still transfer the hot pots to the haybox. <br><br>Another method of cooking with much less energy is using a pressure cooker. Mine is about 40 years old and we finally had to replace the gaskets this year; it belonged to my husband's grandmother. What would take all day in the crock pot takes less than 30 minutes in the pressure cooker. Using a pressure cooker in conjunction with a rocket stove I haven't tried, but it's on my list of things to do.<br><br><a href=#c5375728002045990424 title="comment permalink">12/30/10, 8:56 AM</a><br><br>

I remember constructing a haybox as a Cub Scout project some 45 or 50 years ago.<br><br>I've been thinking about a related problem of late and hope someone may have a few ideas about it or perhaps can point me towards more information. I'm currently running a combination oil/wood boiler to heat a 3,000 SF inn. It's a convenient set up in that when the load of firewood cools down to embers at 3 in the morning, the oil kicks in to keep paying customers from becoming cranky. <br><br><br>I've recently been giving some thought as to how to reduce the amount of wood (and oil) I use. It seems to me that akin to JMG's example of the cooking rice, the vast majority of the energy produced by the burning firewood is going up the chimney. I see the challenge as having a key similarity to solar heating, i.e. capturing and storing heat for later release. My first thought is to increase the system's water storage capacity and insulating the tank(s) haybox-style. Being handy but not exactly an engineer type, I'd like to do this as simply and inexpensively as possible.<br><br>Now I realize that this system isn't collapse-ready; even though I could get by with zero oil usage, it does require electricity to run. However, with an ongoing weatherization regime, several wood stoves in place, and plans for a masonry stove (or two) in the works, I hope to achieve self-sufficiency in the not too distant future.<br><br>Any ideas appreciated.<br><br><a href=#c3301944464072101694 title="comment permalink">12/30/10, 10:41 AM</a><br><br>

Hayboxes are a wonderful way to cook; like crockpots but cheaper and more energy efficient to use.<br><br>I've developed a few basic rules of thumb for haybox cooking that folks may find useful. These are based on my experience with hayboxes of different sizes and types.<br><br>If you can use a pan that has a heavy metal bottom, especially the kind with a metal "sandwich" bottom, that increases the efficiency of your haybox greatly.<br><br>So does making sure that your pot is at least 2/3 full of food before you put it into the haybox. The fuller the pot, the better the heat stays in the haybox.<br><br>Liquid mass helps retain heat. Soups and stews rule! *g*<br><br>If you're not sure how long to cook something, it's useful to assume a haybox cooking time that's about double the stovetop time, and change according to how your own haybox performs. That way you're less likely to have underdone food. (Hayboxes don't really overcook food unless they're very heavily insulated.)<br><br>Make sure any dish containing meat or meat broth gets a good boil before it goes into the haybox, and another when it comes out. I usually boil for ten or twenty minutes going in, and the same when coming out, but I also usually cook fairly large batches of food --- like half a gallon to a gallon of soup. A smaller batch might be fine with a shorter boil. The boiling reduces the risk of foodborne illness. Sadly, we have pathogens to worry about that our grandparents and parents didn't.<br><br><a href=#c9083291813983819690 title="comment permalink">12/30/10, 12:10 PM</a><br><br>

Predicting the future is hardly its only, or even most frequent, application among those who actually pursue it in depth; that's newsstand mass market claptrap. It's used more generally as a kind of Jungian psychological tool, to help understand life, people, society, events, feelings, relationships, etc. etc. etc. in the context of a few dozen interacting archetypes. Whether or not these archetypes have anything to do with their astronomical analogs, on their own they are a powerful and versatile set of tools for interpreting things that involve human psyches. Sure it might be a lot of ink-blot and cold-reading stuff that actually leads you to the "right" archetypes, but if envisioning the dynamic tension between the Moon in Taurus in dissociate conjunction with Venus in Gemini helps you understand your own patterns in interpersonal relationships in a way that helps you and the other people in your life, who gives a flip whether or not what led you to those images is rigorously based in science, or was self-selected by you from a whole bunch of random and arbitrary ideas that were cast in front of you to contemplate?<br><br>On the topic, I'd think that for basic food safety it's important to make sure that everything that goes in the haybox was brought up to boiling temperature first. And, that once you place the lid on the boiling contents, the lid stays on for the duration, no peeking or stirring that could reinoculate the food with more microbes, until it is time to serve and eat.<br><br><a href=#c4673190972691872733 title="comment permalink">12/31/10, 8:42 AM</a><br><br>

I suggest not less than a 5-inch diameter tube; I’ve tried less, but this is the effective size. It’s well worth the time and expense to make at least the high-temperature parts of the stove in stainless steel. As thin as 1mm. will do, but I’d recommend 3mm. It seems never to burn out. I have stoves still working which have been exposed to regular blasts of white-heat temperature for years, without any fire-clay protection, and which still show zero sign of burning through – <br><br>Add a largish wok, with lid; preferably stainless steel throughout, with short metal handles, and no burnable parts –<br><br>Plus a haybox large enough to take the lidded wok, and any other utensils that you use regularly for cooking –<br><br>Plus a solar cooker, for when it’s practicable. Food heated in the solar can go in the haybox as the sun is obscured. Doesn’t matter where the heat comes from –<br><br>Plus serious insulation (straw-bale thicknesses!) for at least the snug area of your home; preferably your whole home, of course – <br><br>Plus really efficient draught stopping and fresh-air throughput control – <br><br>I’ve done all my space-heating and cooking for nearly two decades now like this. The total annual weight of fuel that you’ll need is WAY below what people are used to getting in each winter when they use ordinary wood-stoves (even the modern high-efficiency ones). And the thicknesses of wood needed are much less too. Generally, for either the Winiarski L-shaped cooking rocket or the Ianto Evans J-shaped space-heater rocket, about thumb-thickness sticks or a bit thicker, or heavier stuff split to this thickness, is fine. No need for anything heavier. For years I’ve been able to supply 24-hours-worth of fuel from simply gathering a rucksackful of such sticks as I walk my dogs. In a healthy woodland, you can even manage this without any tools beyond bare hands and boots, though my usual – complete – suite of tools for fire-wooding is a short bill-hook and a 2-foot bow-saw. Usually about half-an-hour’s work per day is ample to gather all you need and cut it to length for the rocket.<br><br>I’m working right now on a rocket design that will combine the uses of both the L rocket and the J rocket. But that’s still a work in progress. Don’t know yet how effective it will be.<br><br><a href=#c7129648868868059826 title="comment permalink">12/31/10, 10:44 AM</a><br><br>

Reading about rocket stoves a couple of years ago was very clarifying, and relates to hayboxes. Thermal mass, such as bricks, stones, water or clay is good to store heat. If the mass is cold, it takes a lot of heat to warm it up, but then it radiates heat for a long time in your home. So, if your rocket stove or haybox is made of a mass material, it will quickly rob the heat from your food, leaving everything uselessly tepid.<br><br>Insulation prevents heat from moving so easily. A common recommendation for rocket stoves is to insulate around them with wood ash. This keeps all the heat in the burn chamber and flowing over your pot--the hay in the haybox does the same.<br><br>One of the commenters mentioned a hybrid--an insulated box, with preheated stone mass put in the bottom to keep the cooking going longer.<br><br><a href=#c2415262817787569190 title="comment permalink">12/31/10, 6:25 PM</a><br><br>

The belief in One Truth and One Way is just plain fundamentalism, regardless of what that One Truth might be.<br><br><a href=#c4333338083089371764 title="comment permalink">12/31/10, 6:39 PM</a><br><br>

I don't have the citations at hand, but there has been a lot of (NPR-style) media attention in recent years about studies of the cognition of the purely rational -- people who through damage or abnormality have lost the emotional functions of their minds. It seems they are utterly terrible at making decisions. They become mired in an endless, unreconcilable pro-con list and are not able to choose between alternatives. It appears that the ultimate engine driving our ability to finally make choices and reach conclusions is emotional and intuitive in nature. Logic and rationality inform, but ultimately they don't decide, determine, conclude, or predict. The real Spock would have suffered from terminal paralysis by analysis. So one can worship at the altar of pure unadulterated rationality if one choses; but remember that this altar only got built because some emotionally-driven leaders and workers made the decisions, drew up the plans, and did the work that resulted in its construction!<br><br><a href=#c100558548781566962 title="comment permalink">1/1/11, 6:54 AM</a><br><br>

Not fireless, but I recall when, in more youthful days spent camping for weeks at a time with rice and fish hooks for companions, one would dig a hole in the ground, toss in coals from a morning camp fire, bury a worm fetched trout or two in a covered pan on top of the coals, cover with leaves and earth and also a ring of rocks, and have dinner later in the day after a dig up. I may run an experiment with my wood stove ash can some morning as I leave for work. Maybe the can will cook carrots which my Dentist recommends over eating them raw – due to the sugar. The practice of astrology has indeed been looking more attractive again during these harder times as some folk seek new answers. However, taking money for the practice is for some, somewhat of an “old-fashioned” occult paradox. Still, I think concerning various occultisms it is indeed true that economic boom times tend to the more surface interests and later, when life enters a somewhat harder cycle, folks tend to wade deeper out into the tide of thought.<br><br><a href=#c2571521660486381539 title="comment permalink">1/1/11, 7:24 AM</a><br><br>

Have they marshaled their resources for large-scale infrastructure projects while on their way down? Somehow that seems unlikely.

One example that might interest us was the effort of Cassiodorus, a Roman Senator, to bring together a comprehensive reference library that would preserve the best parts of the knowledge that his civilization had inherited. It was housed on his country estate, Vivarium, which he also endowed with a monastery full of copyists to ensure its preservation and survival. <br><br>Cassiodorus's own catalog of the Vivarium library has survived (in several later copies), so we can see that his library was amazingly comprehensive for its age. It also contained enough detail that we can still identify a few of the actual manuscripts that Cassiodorus himself has commissioned for it.<br><br>Cassiodorus himself died around the year 585. By about 680 some or all of the manuscripts from Vivarium were up for sale at Rome, where a man named Benedict Biscop purchased some of them and carried them off to England for the twin monasteries he was establishing at Jarrow and Monkwearmouth. After several Viking raids, these monasteries were abandoned in the late 800s, and their libraries dispersed.<br><br>However, one of the most stunning of Cassiodorus's original manuscripts, a huge illustrated Bible in the Old Latin version, was preserved elsewhere. We know what it looked like from Cassiodorus's detailed description in his catalog. We know that it came to Jarrow and/or Monkwearmouth from references to it by monks of that monastery. <br><br>And we next find it at Canterbury, on the high altar of the Cathedral, where it was treated not as a book to be consulted, but as a relic to be preserved. Again, we know it was here from a catalog of manuscripts by a monk attached to the Cathedral. There it remained until it was stolen or destroyed sometime in the 1500s -- it was about one thousand years old by then.<br><br>This is just one example, and a rather dramatic one, of how transient all our efforts to preserve our civilization are likely to be. Still, it's worth the effort.<br><br><a href=#c1452391144551994126 title="comment permalink">1/1/11, 12:31 PM</a><br><br>

Reading someone's life through the position of the planets at their birth and the current alignment of heavenly bodies offers not even a glimmer of a rational explanation, that I can see. The accurate plotting of planetary and astral motion is beyond the best computer. There are unimaginable numbers of heavenly bodies out there that weren't even known when astrology made its entrace and that aren't known today. Gravity is a weak force, and a large truck moving past at the moment of birth, or conception, probably has a greater gravitational influence than Saturn. People believe in all sorts of things.

Real people are NOT archetypes, we are people. It is standard matter of the practice of systems like this (astrology, tarot, I ching, etc.) that EVERY person at EVERY moment in fact embodies/has access to/ connects with ALL the archetypes within their one being in some way. So in contemplating the archetypes, you learn about yourself and all those around you. At any given time and circumstance some of them will speak to you much more strongly than others. And you can deliberately chose to make an effort to alter your relationships to them/ways of expressing them/living in them/etc. Thus their contemplation and manifestation CAN help you and change you, yourself. <br><br>Different systems use different methods to call the various archetypes into your conscious awareness. Some are stochastic (casting coins, dealing cards, etc.), others are systematic (astrology, numerology, etc.). Is there rationality in believing that these systems can somehow magically bring up the symbols and concepts you most need to be contemplating at the present moment? Maybe, maybe not. But even if they are purely random, the empirical fact appears to be that many practitioners DO find that they help them understand their lives, the course and trajectories of events, society, and many other things. Is it rational to reject this just because you don't like some of the underlying mechanics or hypotheses? <br><br>But of course I have three dissociate conjunctions in my natal chart, so I am especially adept at reconciling seemingly disparate entities... ;)<br><br>Re: predicting.. I have found the future to be a shadowy, malleable thing. Even if you have a good handle on the important influences and trends, it's really hard not to wind up surprised at how they actually worked themselves out. This is a very widespread experience. But, if you have a grounding in some belief system (!) that gives you a framework for comprehending the arc of time, the motivating forces of humanity, and the flow of events, then you will have a better toolkit for living in the future as it becomes the present.

Work in what way? Should people be (possibly) misled by others? Should people be exploited by others?<br><br>Yes, I do think astrology is a load of hocum but no-one here has challenged any of the reasons I've mentioned why I think that (and, by the way, as a rationalist, I'm always open to arguments that are counter to my current position), instead it seems to be a matter of: some people believe it works so, regardless of why you think it doesn't, just let it be and let them get on with it.<br><br>Of course, nothing I say here will make one iota of difference to Matt or his chosen path, so I'll drop it there, unless someone can show me some reason, even a glimmer of a reason, why astrology might work.<br><br><a href=#c286061067433579634 title="comment permalink">1/2/11, 2:08 AM</a><br><br>

And even that argument fails -- the gravitational attraction of Saturn is actually greater than that of a full-loaded semi truck 20 m away from you. Jupiter would be much larger, and the Moon enormous by comparison. But you are using a very simplistic, old, Newtonian notion of "rational mechanism." Read a bit about modern physics, and you will see common sense go out the window. Extremely little is actually understood about causation in the universe, in fact; at the quantum level (i.e. the level at which physics really happens) it is a tangled bizarre mess. The nature and origins of conscious self-awareness remain totally unexplained in a rational, materialistic sense. As, I might add, are the nature and origins of gravity still highly controversial and unsettled. Besides, just because you can't envision a mechanism does not mean that a phenomenon is not real. It might work only because people believe it does; but that doesn't mean that it does not work!<br><br><a href=#c5155949442173997933 title="comment permalink">1/2/11, 8:02 AM</a><br><br>

I came to understand that each person has their own, truly real truth, whereas I had previously thought (usually on her part) there was an imperfect grasp of an objective reality. <br><br>This led to the "You said this, No I said that" sort of conversations.<br><br>Since my work rubs up against brain research I have read a lot of studies that show, that, even if I could videotape every conversation and play it back, the own truth is often more powerful than the objective reality. "If the facts don't fit the frame, ignore the facts". Like, say, insisting the moon landing happened on a Hollywood sound stage.<br><br>Under the objective reality model, I would tend to think of people who see spirits, since the skeptics and scientists cannot measure what they claim to see, as being somehow so weak they need to make stuff up. So sure, maybe angels don't exist, but real people are having direct experiences.<br><br>Under the multiple truths way of thinking, they <i>are</i> seeing spirits. Maybe they are needy. But maybe they have capabilities I don't have.<br><br>Other people who can see things I can't are called musicians or artists. I feel lucky to hang at the edges of their vision and to get a tiny look at their insight--into their universe.<br><br>So I think there are a great many people who have vision as beautiful as composers, but we haven't created music halls or museums for the unexplainable. It is mystifying and wonderful to peer into a world unexplainable to me.<br><br>So, astrology doesn't work for me, nor does Tarot or the I Ching or dream analysis.

But maybe even better scientific tools won't explain them, maybe we need a whole new system of inquiry and understanding.<br><br>I don't know what an integrated model of science and the unexplainable would look like, but in order to find it, both science and the unexplainable will need to stop dismissing each other, and accept they both offer aspects of real human experience.<br><br><a href=#c7938471307606591089 title="comment permalink">1/2/11, 12:42 PM</a><br><br>

I tend to think of Jungian psychology as simply one more myth of individuation, but that's just me. ;-)<br><br>Sofistek, I've always found it entertaining to watch the gyrations that rationalists will go through to avoid cognitive dissonance when the world doesn't match their presuppositions. By all means avoid looking me up on Amazon!<br><br>Lance, well, of course he's going to use straw men. The whole business about "predicting the future" is a straw man. What I'm trying to do here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i> is trying to predict the future from subtle clues in the present, which is exactly what Matt Savinar is doing; he's just using clues that Sofistek rejects out of hand as irrelevant. For the same reason, Sofistek won't look me up on Amazon, because that would force him to face the fact that the extremely simplistic rhetorical divide between "reason" and "belief" he's using doesn't do justice to the facts. <br><br>Hawlkeye, good.

But thanks for the response on this, it's the kind of response I was looking for. You're quite right, that most trucks would not exert the same force as the moon. I think I read that somewhere and didn't check it (but now have), or it was referring to a larger earth bound object, like a mountain. However, some trucks would exceed the force of the moon, and Jupiter, depending on the distance from the person (e.g. one of those tar sands mining trucks would be almost double the effect, at close range). The gravitational force of the earth, of course, would dwarf all of those other forces.<br><br>Again, you're right that just because I can't imagine a mechanism doesn't mean there isn't one (and I'm with you on the bizarre effects at the quantum level).

One very recent example: since I was in the neighborhood, I stopped by the Magus Bookshop to see if maybe the book on retrograde planets that I'd requested a couple weeks before had come in. It turned out, when I ran the chart for the hour/minute/second of the sale recorded on the receipt, that Mercury (which in the astrological system “rules” books and other tools for conveying ideas and information), which was ending its three-week retrograde phase about 14 hours later, was at that moment at its daily zenith, a power point—exactly!

I feel for you, as you are highly outnumbered, and sticking to your convictions (and aren't we supposed to be talking about hayboxes?), BUT... here's the thing. One of the biggest stories of 2010 (to me, anyway) was a recent study that concluded that placebos work EVEN WHEN YOU KNOW YOU ARE TAKING ONE. To me, this speaks to the enormous and uncontrollable power that we call the human mind. When a drug company tells you that their new pill is 20% more effective than placebo, they are also telling you that the majority of their pill's effect derives from belief (side effects may include bleeding gums, nausea, reduction of one's bank account, and continued dependence on Big Pharma). Once we agree that the most reliable and safe tool for improving our situation is between our ears (though I should point out here that my own personal definition of mind extends beyond the brain), then it really is up to us as individuals to follow our beliefs wherever they take us, and resist the idea of objective reality whenever possible. I have no personal experience researching the Creationism/Evolution debate, other than reading about it, but I choose to believe the world is far older than 600 years, there was no talking snake that started this mess, etc. I also choose to believe that all grains are bad for you, and bacon is healthy. If we dig deep enough, we can find reasons to disagree with every person on this blog, and every person on Earth. As you, JMG, and I know, there is no time for that. So I will not only share my eggs with homeopaths, Muslims, and Republicans, I will even make an effort to refrain from judging them, because we all have beliefs that others consider wrong and even harmful, and it is our actions that count. If we consider a person NOT DOING what we want them to do to be a "harmful action," we should clean up our own houses as well and thoroughly as possible before casting stones. I have yet to replace my toilets with the composing variety, nor do I have any goats yet, so I will focus on those tasks (and a hundred others), and leave judgment of others to future generations.

If you haven't understood the very fundamental conceptual underpinnings of something, then perhaps you are not really in a good place to dismiss it as obviously irrational hokum. That's the same approach taken by religious fundamentalists in dismissing science. You need not agree with something to understand it. I know perfectly well how the mind of an evangelical fundamentalists conceives of the world; I do not however feel the same way. As for mechanisms, you don't need to understand the mechanisms of something to use it. People were able to successfully breed animals and direct their evolution for many millenia before reproductive biology and genetics were understood. And I must point out, once again, even if this is all "placebo effect," the placebo effect is REAL, and actually does cause people to get better. <br><br>You worry about the deleterious effects of "superstitions" when misapplied.

After ignoring the implications of climate change and peak oil for several years I spent another year or so just hoping someone more intelligent than I would provide a solution. Ultimately I embraced the dilemma but like most people I responded by relying on the skills, knowledge and experience I already have, regardless of it applicability, I my case primitive hunting and gathering which had always been a hobby not a lifestyle; only after reading this blog did I begin to adopt some less drastic options more suitable to my current physical environment, which is no longer in an area where hunting and gathering are practical. I have started gardening, composting, canning and looking through the tattered and often poorly printed and type set pages of whole earth catalogue books I didn’t even know I owned. I still can’t get as much from my pitiful garden as I can collecting wild foods like acorns, mushrooms and crawfish but I’m working on it and the less drastic options provided by green wizardry might even save my marriage. After a particularly unfortunate week long foray into the high desert of California, where we were greeted by freezing temperatures and sixty mile an hour winds, my wife told me if this is what is required to survive she “might as well just end the whole thing early and get done with it.” She hasn’t spent more than two consecutive nights under the stars since and then only when weather was balmy and we were roasting marshmallows. <br><br>I’m not a fan of astrology about which I know next to nothing but I read Mr. Savinar’s irritated letters to the readers and tended to agree with him that many of the posters on his sites were seriously off course and I support the closure of his site. I wish him well.<br><br><a href=#c3082840764279043786 title="comment permalink">1/5/11, 1:13 PM</a><br><br>

If that analysis is wrong -- if he's really an Astrologer now -- he looks like an idiot (or worse). He also provides succor to the consensus trance about peak oil (see? peak oil is for nuts!) that Matt worked so hard and so well to shatter. And for a few individuals, he did shatter it.<br><br>Peak oil may have been a "theory" in 1956 when King Hubbert announced it, but after 1970 (when the USA peaked, exactly as predicted) it became a fact. Readers here are well aware of the physics and geology that make the conclusion of peak oil unavoidable (for example, the long decades during which the world has found not only fewer oil fields, but consistently *smaller* ones than the year before: itself a proof the cause is geological, not political).<br><br>And while Matt at times looked hell bent at spreading panic to profit from it (get food packs for your shelter -- on sale today!), the peak oil story is genuinely terrifying, and Matt told the tale with facts and charts consistent with a reasoned discussion.<br><br>And now... ASTROLOGY!<br><br>What next, alien abduction?<br><br>Sure, lots of perfectly terrific people take a daily peek at their horoscope. But there is also no question it utterly unscientific. At best it is a method to tap intuition (interpreting the stars in the manner of interpreting rorschach cards); but it is also a giant step into the unreasoning world of superstition, the evil eye, antisemitism and blood letting to cure disease. First Matt Savinar prognosicated with science; now stirs animal entrails. One of the reasons I fear the end of industrial civilization is the end of science that may accompany it; now Matt Savinar seems hellbent on accelerating the very decline he warned was inevitable.<br><br>Please, Matt, give us a clue to let us know you were bought off! And handsomely, I hope.<br><br>But if Matt Savinar has sincerely gone Astrological, he should have the courtesy and decency to change his name.
