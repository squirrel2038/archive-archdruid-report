“I feel my fate in what I cannot fear,” poet Theodore Roethke wrote in his most famous poem, “The Waking.” He could have been speaking for any of us; as individuals, communities, or societies, it’s not the problems we dread but the ones we’re unable to take seriously, or fail to recognize as problems at all, that end up dragging us down.<br><br>Some of the responses to last week’s <i>Archdruid Report</i> post brought that point forcefully home to me. The theme of that post, as regular readers will remember, is that it’s meaningless to talk about the efficiency of machines vis-a-vis human beings unless the costs of the whole system needed to produce, maintain, and operate the machines is compared to the costs of the whole system needed to do the same for the human beings. In response to the post, a flurry of critics on and off the comments page of this blog presented arguments that simply ignored the system costs I’d spent the entire post discussing. I would have had no complaints if they’d disagreed with my analysis, or even argued against the inclusion of system costs altogether – the logic of dissensus, the deliberate cultivation of divergent strategies, is as relevant to my work as it is anywhere else – but that’s not what they did. Instead, they acted as though the issue of system costs had never been raised at all.<br><br>It’s a fascinating lapse of reason, and it keeps on surfacing in contemporary discussions of the deindustrial future. The recurrent debates on the future of the internet here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i> come forcefully to mind. The point I’ve made there is that the survival of the internet doesn’t depend on whether maintaining some form of internet is technically possible in a post-peak world, on the one hand, and desirable on the other; it depends on whether the internet will be able to pay for itself, and successfully compete for scarce dollars against lower-tech ways of sending letters and selling porn, in a future when energy and resources are costly and harshly limited, while human labor is abundant and cheap. <br><br>With unnerving predictability, in turn, those who want to dispute my suggestion simply insist that the internet will survive because it’s technically feasible in a post-peak world, on the one hand, and desirable on the other. They don’t challenge the economic issue; they don’t address it at all; they simply raise their voices and talk even more loudly about the technical feasibility and desirability of the internet. What makes this all the more intriguing is that these are not stupid people; one and all, they’re bright and, at least by the standards of the present age, well-educated; catch them on this one point, though, and the result is a mental equivalent of the famous Blue Screen of Death.<br><br>From a broader perspective, this same inability to think about whole systems pervades contemporary industrial culture. You don’t have to go as far as the dwindling community of space-colony fans to find good examples, though that’s one I’ll be discussing down the road a bit; just notice how many people seem to believe that all the garbage and pollution they generate goes to a mythical place called “Away,” or that the Earth will provide us with an infinite supply of crude oil if we just keep drilling holes in her. (“We can’t be out of petroleum, we’ve still got drilling rigs left.”) For that matter, the paralogical thinking that drives speculative bubbles – if everybody is going to get rich by investing in the gimmick du jour, what does that suggest will happen to the value of money? – has rarely if ever been as popular as it is in modern America, and it depends as completely on a blindness to the implications of whole systems as any of the points I’ve mentioned.<br><br>I’d like to discuss another example at this point, though, because it bears directly on one of the central themes I’ve been developing here in recent months. What would you say, dear reader, if I told you that I’ve come up with a way to eliminate unemployment in the United States – yes, even in the face of the current economic mess? What if I explained that it would also improve the effective standard of living of many American families and decrease their income tax burdens? And that it would also increase our economic resilience and sustainability, and simultaneously cause a significant decrease in the amount of automobile traffic on America’s streets and highways? Would you be all for it?<br><br>No, dear reader, you wouldn’t. Permit me to explain why.<br><br>Right now, many two-income families with children in the United States are caught in a very curious economic bind. I haven’t been able to find statistics, but I personally know quite a few families for whom the cost of paid child care and one partner’s costs for commuting, business clothes, and all the other expenses of employment, approaches or even exceeds the take-home pay of one partner. Factor in the benefits of shifting to a lower tax bracket, and for a great many of these families, becoming a single-income family with one partner staying out of the paid work force would actually result in an increase in disposable income each month.<br><br>This is even before factoring in the financial elephant in the living room of the old one-income family: the economic benefits of the household economy. It’s only in the last half dozen decades that the home has become nothing more than a center of consumption; before then, it was a place where real wealth was produced. It costs a great deal less to buy the raw materials for meals than to pick up something from the supermarket deli on the way home from work, as so many people do these days, or to fill the pantry and the fridge with prepackaged processed food; it costs a great deal less to buy yarn than to purchase socks and afghans of anything like the quality a good knitter can make; it costs a great deal less to grow a good fraction of a family’s vegetables in a backyard garden than to buy them fresh at the grocery, if you can get them at all. <br><br>The difference in each case – and examples like this could be multiplied manyfold – is made by the household economy. Economists like to dismiss the household economy as inefficient, but it’s worth remembering that “efficiency” in current economic jargon is defined as labor efficiency – that is an economic process is considered more efficient if it uses less human labor, no matter how wildly inefficent it is in any other sense. Economists also like to dismiss the household economy because it lacks economies of scale, and here they’re on firmer ground. Still, there’s another factor that more than counterbalances this; much of the value of an employee’s labor – as much, as Marxists like to remind us, as the employer can get away with taking – goes to support his employer, while all of the value produced by labor in the household market remains with the family and is used directly, without being mediated through the money economy.<br><br>This is why, until quite recently, at least half the adult members of most families, aside from the urban poor, worked in the household economy instead of the money economy. It’s also why a grandparent or two or an unmarried aunt so often found a place in the family setting. This had very little to do with charity; an extra pair of hands that could be employed in the household economy was a significant economic asset to most families. One of the advantages of this, of course, is that elderly people continued to have a valued and productive role in their families and communities, instead of being paid to go away and do nothing until they die, as so many of them are today.<br><br>None of these things are any less possible today than they were in the 1920s, or for that matter the 1820s. As a former househusband, I can say this on the basis of personal experience; my wife and I found that we had a better standard of living on her bookkeeper’s salary alone, with a thriving full time household economy, than we had earlier on two salaries with only the scraps of a household economy the two of us could manage after work and commuting. I came in for a certain amount of derision for making that choice, of course, though it’s only fair to say that I got off very lightly in comparison to the abuse leveled, mostly by women, at those women I knew who made a similar decision.<br><br>Now of course that touches on one of the most volatile issues touching on the household economy, the politics of gender. For complex cultural reasons, a great many feminists in the 1960s and 1970s came to believe that working for one’s family in the household economy was a form of slavery, while working for an employer in the money economy – often under conditions that were even more exploitative – was a form of liberation. Now it’s certainly true that assigning people to participation in the household economy by gender was unfair, but it’s equally true that assigning them to participation in the money economy on the same basis was no better; for every woman whose talents were wasted in a housewife’s role, there was arguably a man whose life would have been much happier and more productive had he had the option of working full time in the household economy.<br><br>Feminism might usefully have challenged the relative social status assigned to the household and money economies, and pressed for a revaluation of work and gender that could have thrown open a much broader field of possibilities to people of both genders; and in fact some thoughtful steps were taken in this direction by a few perceptive thinkers in the movement. In general, though, that turned out to be the road not taken. Instead, the great majority of women simply accepted the social value given to participation in the money economy, demanded access to it for themselves, and got it. In the process, for most Americans, the household economy collapsed, or survived only as a dowdy sort of hobby practiced by the insufficiently fashionable.<br><br>Let’s grant at the outset, therefore, that there’s no particular reason why people of one gender ought to be more active in the household economy than people of the other; let’s assume that a great many men will make the choice I did, and work full time in the household economy while the women in their lives work full time for a paycheck. On that basis, is there a point to two-income families shifting gears and becoming families that combine one cash income with a productive household economy? Of course there is, and now more than ever.<br><br>To begin with, as already mentioned, a significant number of families with children would gain an immediate boost in their disposable income each month by taking the kids home from daycare, giving up the second commute (and in some cases, the second car as well), dropping the other expenses that come with paid employment, and taking a wild downhill ride through the income tax brackets. A great many more would find that when these benefits are combined with the real wealth produced by the household economy, they came out well ahead. Even those who simply broke even would be likely to find that differences in quality, though hard to measure in strictly economic terms, would make the change more than worthwhile.<br><br>Now take a moment to think of the effects on community and society. Take a significant amount of the workforce out of paid employment, and two things happen: first, unemployment rates go down, and second, competition among employers for the remaining workers tends to drive wages up. Some sectors of the economy would be negatively affected, to be sure; sales of convenience foods would decrease, and so would employment in the day care industry, among others; still, these industries would be affected by the contraction in workforce numbers along with all the others, and those employees who needed to find a job elsewhere would be entering a job market where their chances would be much better than they are at present. There would need to be some adjustments, especially to retirement arrangements, but those are going to have to happen fairly soon anyway.<br><br>Finally, factor in the impact of such a change on the resilience and sustainability of society. A nation in which a very large fraction of the workforce is insulated from the money economy, and produces a diverse array of goods and services at home for local consumption using relatively simple tools, is a nation that’s much better prepared to face the economic turmoil of the end of the age of cheap oil than a nation where nearly everyone depends for their income, as well as for the goods and services they use every day, on the global economy. A nation in which, let’s say, 30% fewer people have to drive to work than they do today is much better prepared to face the price spikes and shortages that will almost inevitably affect gasoline and other petroleum products in the years to come. A nation in which doing things for yourself again has a recognized social value is much better prepared for a future in which we will have to do much more for ourselves than most people can imagine just now.<br><br>So when can we expect the return of the single-income family to become an element of constructive plans for the post-peak future? When will Transition Town programs, let’s say, match up the experienced elderly with novice househusbands and housewives who want to learn how to cook, sew, can, garden, and knit? When will high-profile liberal couples start throwing parties to announce that one member of the pair is quitting paid employment, so that the poor have an easier job market and a better chance at upward mobility? When will people aggressively lobby their congressflacks to get a sizable income tax deduction and special Social Security arrangements for families with one income?<br><br>Let’s just say I’m not going to hold my breath. In fact, dear reader, I’m quite confident that even if you belong to that large group of married couples with children who could increase your disposable income by giving up that second job, you won’t do it; in fact, you won’t even run the numbers to see whether it would work for you – and the reason you won’t is that you’re so mesmerized by that monthly check of $2000 a month take-home, or whatever it happens to be, that you can’t imagine giving it up even if you have to spend $2200 a month to get it. That is to say, dear reader, that if you don’t think in terms of whole systems, the fact that the system costs of that second job might just outweigh the benefits will be as incomprehensible to you as a computer would have been to a medieval peasant.<br><br>The extraordinary blindness to whole systems that pervades our collective consciousness these days is a fairly recent thing – as recently as the 1970s, talk about system costs got far fewer blank stares and non sequiturs than it does today – and I doubt it will last long in historical terms, if only because the hard edge of Darwinian selection separates adaptive cultural forms from maladaptive ones with the same ruthlessness it applies to genetics. While it remains in place, it will likely cause a great deal of damage, but that in itself will tend to accelerate its replacement with some less dysfunctional habit of thought. Ironically, the Theodore Roethke poem with which I started this post offers a cogent reminder of that. It begins:<br><br>I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.<br>I feel my fate in what I cannot fear.<br>I learn by going where I have to go.<br><br>We will all, I think, learn a great deal by going where we have to go during the lean and challenging years to come. The hope that we might manage to learn a thing or two in advance of that journey is understandable enough, and the thing has happened now and then in history; still, for reasons already discussed, that hope seems very frail to me just now.

We're so defined by our (paid) careers that in giving them up we lose more than just an income - we lose a certain sense of identity, and often the respect of others. Our culture looks down severely on those who choose not to work. <br><br>But if the numbers add up, people will eventually make the shift. My reservations are about how this will effect the status of women; you've glossed over the fact that the gender makeup of home-workers is vanishingly unlikely to be 50:50. Perhaps it shouldn't be. But I am not eager for a return to the vulnerability of being economically dependent on a man. The system is exploitative, but I still live freer than my grandmother or great-grandmother did. I suspect it's inevitable, however; One paid worker, one home worker, and their children (not to mention any extended family) have made up a most efficient economic unit for much of history, and once the wild excesses of the current age have started to dwindle, I suspect we'll find ourselves drifting back towards it.<br><br>One unexpected side-effect of this return may be the rebirth of the neighbourhood community. This is only anecdotal, but my grandmother claims that it was women starting to work that lead to its breakdown - they no longer had the time to chat on their doorsteps or gossip over the clothesline. I suppose we'll see.<br><br><a href=#c601651958129387291 title="comment permalink">4/14/10, 10:46 PM</a><br><br>

She agreed to the move on the condition that she could stay at home. I was initially opposed to the idea, not on economic grounds, but psychological grounds (I'd crunched the numbers already and seen that it was economically feasible). <br><br>My wife has a Masters degree, and very nearly her PhD, and I did not believe that she would find domestic work to be stimulating or engaging enough. The long story short is that despite her own wishes, being a stay-at-home mom has very literally challenged her sanity, so that now, regardless of the economics (Child care for example is going to consume a significant portion of her expected salary), she is returning to the work-for-pay world.<br><br>The economics of our experience have been interesting. Granted, the new job I took included an increase in pay and relocation to an area with a slightly lower cost of living. Still, it's been amazing that it's worked, and at first, neither of us believed that it would.<br><br>Some of the lessons we've learned though, that are relevant to your post are that, in order to successfully transition to a single-income household in this society, all parties have to understand the implications of the move.<br><br>It also helps to start out with the belief that all work is equal - our society tends to view revenue producing labor as being worth more than work that does not produce revenue. In my case, I've always had the fundamental belief that all work was equal, but my wife hasn't, and in spite of the fact that she was able to view our 'books' and see where the money went, has felt dependent and confined.<br><br>Another factor, which is really the same factor restated, is that all parties must actually value the non-monetary benefits of becoming a single-income family. One of the biggest of those, from my perspective at least, has been time - we've both had more of it. If the time isn't valued however, it becomes as burdensome as debt.<br><br><a href=#c3606008932680255193 title="comment permalink">4/14/10, 11:00 PM</a><br><br>

But it's not like eradication of anything but gardening and fabric weaving is the goal. I think as you say if 30% of people moved towards a foundation of home economy the effect would be immense and, I feel, beneficial not only for those making the move but for the stability of the greater economy and its resistance to oncoming scarcity of ubiquitous resources.<br><br>Also, I'll just add for the sake of gender politics that this household economy no longer has to be thought of in the husband-wife/male-female dynamic. No doubt many people are still loathe to accept queer couples, nevertheless they are quite likely these days to participate openly in your community and deserve a mention here.<br><br><a href=#c5417893018968890117 title="comment permalink">4/14/10, 11:07 PM</a><br><br>

I'm one myself. Of course I move in limited circles myself so we may well be a vanishingly small minority in the wider world, or even in Australia. <br><br>I know you have your doubts about the transition town concept and so do I (even though I started this group!) but it seems to be what the people want: there is a need for a label or concept on which you can hang your hopes. How it will develop I really don't know as the members of the several groups I've gotten tangled up are a strange collection of types. It may be because they are not age-segregated as the movements of the sixties and seventies tended to be.<br><br>However I have to say that the consensus within these groups does tend to come down pretty solidly on the side of the household economy, so don't despair!<br><br><a href=#c632033640158044118 title="comment permalink">4/14/10, 11:24 PM</a><br><br>

We are doomed, because of the human natural tendency to not become obsessed adequately enough with the cause of the problems, but rather with the symptomatic treatments. I wonder if this tendency was any different in the human history. The Vedas say we are in the Kali Yuga Age, which could be connected with this unlogical limited-view behaviour. I hope different Ages (should start from 2012? I am not sure) engender different logic of thinking in us - especially these about the treatment of the causes and care about the longtime effectiveness of the systems. But it's just my little theory, that gives me a little hope of escaping from this deadly society circle (master/slaves), as we are for thousand years.<br><br>With my limited practical knowledge, I would like to be inspired with many options that are possible to pursue by the household person, especially if they live in a flat without a garden. I can't imagine enough useful tasks. But I bet, I will find the inspiration in the comments soon :-)<br><br><a href=#c3543885373942901802 title="comment permalink">4/14/10, 11:36 PM</a><br><br>

A Soviet pilot defected from Siberia with a MIG-25 jet fighter and landed in Japan. US engineers analyzed the airplane and were surprised to find water in the cooling system instead of the alcohol it was designed for. The pilot explained that vodka was in short supply, so the mechanics drank the alcohol intended for the plane and replaced it with water. The plane would have crashed if flown hard enough to stress the cooling system. This is a small example of how it takes very little to undermine a complex system like a jet fighter.<br><br>We in the West have such complex societies that few can imagine the interdependencies among systems. Pick any system (e.g., banking, water, electricity, transport) and imagine that it is disrupted or simply unreliable (as are such things in, say, India), then imagine the domino effects on everything else.<br><br>Perhaps Americans will one day keep their old PCs running, much as Cubans kept 1950s cars alive.

About a decade and half ago we made the decision to shop at markets of which there are quite a few in Melbourne. Now we are rurally based we shop at farm gates (awesome quality and taste), local small suppliers and markets for all other food stuffs. We also grow our own which helps.<br><br>One of the things we quickly discovered was that it was actually cheaper to buy the raw materials and cook meals from scratch than to buy any form of processed foods. On reflection this now seems common sense.<br><br>Getting back to cultural programming though, I have heard a lie often repeated from quite intelligent and educated people that fresh fruit and vegetables are more expensive than processed food. It took me ages to work out what they meant. <br><br>The general gist is that the time involved and hassle in obtaining reasonable fresh fruit and vegetables exceeds that of purchasing the same items from the local supermarket. Even if the cost of those items is sometimes four times as high or the items are picked under ripe so they travel and store well. It sounds something like this, "YUK. I wouldn't want to shop at a market as it is a peasant activity".<br><br>(I cannot speak for other countries here as this is the Australian experience. I understand that places such as Detroit have very limited access to fresh fruit and vegetables regardless so they have further complicating issues.)<br><br>The simple fact is that like the household economy, markets aren't considered to be very sexy and as such it lacks appeal for Western society. Change will only occur when forced upon them by outside forces. Few like to challenge the status quo.<br><br>We're building our own house which is a very rare thing nowadays, although once quite common eg. post WWII when there were material and labour shortages. This activity is contributing to our own household economy greatly and in under two years of part time labour we are saving decades of work in the outside economy. Yet the majority of comments we have received are a bit scornful and derisive (fortunately not from the inspectors though!). <br><br>Unpaid labour doesn't have the social cachet of a big fat salary cheque, but people rarely look at the big picture and ask where it is all going? Even worse, they don't wonder if by their very actions they are making themselves more vulnerable to external shocks.<br><br>As a member of generation X, I remember vividly the recession of the early 1990's, 10% unemployment, and interest rates for mortgages hovering around the 18% mark.<br><br>Australia is in the grip of a private debt binge which is unprecedented. Perhaps, we all should look at reducing our outgoings and boosting the household economy and actually producing some real goods and not passively spend our time as worker rats and consumers.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><a href=#c2256603653345576124 title="comment permalink">4/15/10, 2:29 AM</a><br><br>

A stay-at-home husband (due to involuntary unemployment) with a full-time employed wife is a fairly common arrangement around here, with the evaporation of manufacturing, death of farming, and shrinkage of construction. Many of these bread-winning wives, however, come home to the expectation that they will still cook supper, clean the house, and do the laundry. This expectation is instilled in both the stay-at-home husband and the working wife. Daddy may fix the cars and mow the lawn, but he doesn't pack the kid's lunch for school.

Even if your $2000 paycheck costs you more than $2000, it still serves as a kind of insurance for individuals and families. For the individual, it means that, in the event of divorce after 5 or 10 or 20 years of marriage, the former stay-at-home spouse doesn't have to reenter the work force with little to no work experience (and end up subsisting on what is likely to be a poverty wage). And for families, it provides a cushion against a possible job loss of the only breadwinner (it's easier, I would think, to go from a two-paycheck family to a one-paycheck family, than to go from a one-paycheck family to a no-paycheck family). And of course, there's the issue of domestic abuse and the difficulties associated with the abused spouse leaving the marriage when, economically, s/he fully depends on the abuser. <br><br>In the extended family context (or at least some versions of it), I think your ideas would work much better. A 10-adult household in which five adults work is much better prepared to handle the job loss of one working adult than is a two-adult household in which only one person works. And as for divorce, well, you'd either have to make divorce much more difficult, or have arrangements where it's understood that the non-working spouse can move back in with relatives (if s/he originally lived with in-laws); the latter could work as a cushion against abuse, too, I would think. <br><br>But as long as the nuclear family is the norm, what you're suggesting is a bit too risky for my taste.<br><br><a href=#c7275280861218058958 title="comment permalink">4/15/10, 6:11 AM</a><br><br>

These arguments have been raised by many, and they bear repeating over and over until it sinks in. Interestingly just this week Sharon Astyk did a related post on the extended family. For a fuller discussion on the economics of the two-income family and its discontent, including all the statistics you were hoping to find, see “The Two Income Trap” by Elizabeth Warren. <br><br>I have to wonder, though, how many jobs in our so-called service economy are completely related to servicing the dual worker, nuclear family. It’s not as though a bunch of manufacturing jobs would suddenly be available, at least not initially (at some point we will be forced to start making things close to home). How many jobs, such as those you mentioned but even more, would simply disappear? Given that our whole economy is a hall of mirrors, and we probably <i>have</i> created an economy based on each of us taking in someone else’s laundry, what happens when we no longer need someone else to clean our clothes?

I run errands with an old, long-paid-for, no amenities, used Honda wagon kept alive with preventive maintenance. My RDP (Registered Domestic Partner) brings home the bacon to house us, but lives with a higher level of amenities, late model Prius and social services she can afford.

In fact, I knew what you were going to suggest before you even actually said the words. We did the one income bit back in the 1990s, when we birthed our twins who had an older three year old brother. But then again we were also in a house we had just bought for only $30,000 on an FHA mortgage, and I had a fairly decent teaching position where I need to walk just five blocks to work, so those costs weren't to high. And after the twins got a little older so my wife wasn't breast feeding them anymore, she watched over to other kids as well for a friend of ours, which brought in a few extra dollars each day and provided a needed service to another. When my wife did back to being active again outside the house, it was back to school and get set for an entirely new profession (ministry as a pastor), which is entirely again different that typical 8 hour-a-day jobs.<br><br>Single-income households will work better at particular stages in households, such as with child-bearing years and maybe pre-retirement, such as after children are long gone and out of college. The in-between period - for instance, middle to senior high school, or the college years - are definitely tougher times to do this, as the income needs are generally higher at that time. For instance, with college, you would think that having a low income will work to your advantage for financial aid, and generally it does, but that doesn't account for the relative shift these days, with tight state budgets, to expect to fill the gap with scholarships. Also the emphasis on "family contribution" is definitely in the formulas for determining eligibility for educational aid. The end result, I fear, for families in this situation is lots and lots of loans (both student and parent), which just shifts the pain to later and doesn't help the situation.<br><br>The other kickers that mess up the general ability for single income households are house values, as someone else has noted, geography (as related to differences in housing values), and insurance. Houses are generally much more expensive these days, as are expected/needed insurance, with some areas definitely more expensive than others, which will stretch single household incomes very thin. Compared to ten years ago, let alone twenty or thirty years or more, it is higher relative costs of housing and insurance that will be challenging. To successfully manage the single-income route, one will likely also need to radically alter, as in significantly lower, their expectations for housing and insurance. While not sub-standard housing, it will likely be significantly below the norm, and more families likely opt to go without insurance or be under-insured.<br><br>But in general I agree with you that a return to more single-income households is both desirable, and likely necessary, as the number of jobs continue to shrink and we adjust to a much smaller economy. Being proactive in adjusting one's lifestyle is definitely better than the alternative of being forced into this situation while already in a too-expensive house or area.<br><br><a href=#c7160934125078629105 title="comment permalink">4/15/10, 9:40 AM</a><br><br>

When I was first married, back in the early bronze age, my wife and I had a talk about work and money that mirrored the first few paragraphs of your essay. The result of this was that we decided we would budget such that we could live off one income (mine). If my wife was working all of her salary would be saved to make the down payment for our first house or the land we now live on. The rest of the time she would be working in the household economy.<br><br>This has given us an enormous amount of flexibiliy. One of your posters writes "there is potentially some valuable additional resilience offered by two incomes..". I beg to differ. Most of the people I know who have two incomes quickly ramp up their consumption to take up the two incomes (and sometimes more). When either of them loses a job, they are immediately in crisis mode. When I went through a stint of unemployment a few years ago, the spouse immediately started a housecleaning business to bring in some income while I painted the house, cut firewood and did other productive things. This gave me a feeling of being useful and provided some of the things we needed without the usual cash outlay. That's resiliency!<br><br>Another comment I'd make is that in my experience kids raised in a household with at least one parent present are happier, better balanced, and have a closer relationship with their parents than those shipped off to day care. I know in today's world there are some parents who have no option but to use day care, but the household economy pays huge dividends to the children lucky enough to be raised in it.<br><br>Finally, the household economy prizes generalists - you need to be able to do a lot of things reasonably well. Whereas the corporate world tends to demand specialization - people who know everything about something and nothing about anything else. Perhaps this is the source of the frustration you express at people not getting the big picture, systems view, of the subjects of your posts.

This goes on for a while, then crumbles, reverting us to Scenario 1.<br><br>Allow me to flesh out Scenario 2, hypothetically speaking. <br><br>Assume for a moment that our national wealth evaporates and energy gets much more expensive. Assume government then subsidizes the internet, TV, and the agribusinesses. Travel goes away, especially intercontinental travel. Demand for all the equipment and infrastructure needed by the travel industry shrivels up . Demand for mass produced plastic goods from China shrivels up. The average person becomes ever more dependent on government largesse. Financiers in concert with the government capture ever greater shares of the national wealth via debt, which people need because their incomes cannot keep up with the rising cost of living, and via clubby speculative activities amongst themselves.<br><br>Assume we accomplish the above through a controlled demolition. We know the economy cannot support this level of economic activity, so when it all starts falling to pieces, we allow the process to take place, except for the nodes needed above, which are bailed out. Alternatively, we could allow the whole system to fail, after which the government or its private proxies buy up the pieces for cheap out of the bankruptcy court.<br><br>Oil consumption goes way down because of the lack of demand for some or all of the products and services above. <br>Scenario 2 would force all the deflation into cars, travel, discretionary consumer products, and oil demand from those uses. <br>This alleviates the energy problem for a time.<br><br>People just stay indoors on Facebook and Twitter all day. The outside world gets less and less relevant to the average Joe. The vast increase in available oil goes towards the military to impose control domestically and internationally, towards the agribusinesses to run their industrial food factories, and towards maintenance of the infrastructure required to keep this simplified system going. These and telecommuting lower level government workers are the primary job centers. Wages fall due to the oversupply of available labor relative to demand. Populations fall.<br><br>We end up getting all of our food from centralized agribusinesses. Our food gets less and less nutritive as genetic modifications boost the size of our food but not its nutrients. Food choice shrinks as people increasingly can only afford the subsidized staple crops - corn, soybeans, and the like.<br> <br>One big factor here is how tightly state and corporate powers merge. If Monsanto is able to get the government to enforce a rule that US plebians cannot get any seeds except from Monsanto, there will be no large scale move to the home economy, just dependence on food from Monsanto. A form of new age slavery emerges.<br><br>Corporations want money and governments want control. The more the better. <br><br>Scenario 1 obviates the goals of corporations and governments. Scenario 2 allows corporations and government to hang on for longer. Of course, corporations and government will be confined to the energy and wealth realities the system imposes on them ... but they will do whatever they can to hang on, that much seems for sure. <br><br>Just something to think about...<br><br><a href=#c5721177848331003929 title="comment permalink">4/15/10, 10:26 AM</a><br><br>

It’s a topic I have done a lot of thinking about over the years. Let me first say, speaking as a feminist, that I agree with you both in the economics of single-earner households as you state them, and in the “sanity advantages” of not being in the “efficient” workforce of today. As you stated it, it is the most intelligent response to the current employment and cultural situation we have. But that situation, I think, is only about 10 years old, particularly in the cost/benefit equation of wages vs. housecare costs. Also, in the stress equation of pressured jobs for lower pay.<br><br>But my first objection is that for many families the situation isn’t as you stated: some can’t afford childcare, and so leave the kids with neighbors or at the free after-school programs; some have too much debt to be able to switch to one-income (which is another issue, I know) – and for all families, while it is true that knitting-one’s-own (or sewing) gives you much finer quality, it is not true that it’s cheaper! I have been a home sewer, crocheter, etc for years, and I have to say that what happens is you spend the same amount of money and get better quality. (And the Eugene, OR “Black Sheep Gathering” is to die for! ;-}) For many struggling families, that’s not an option; they buy cheap imported goods because that’s what they can afford (and yes, I agree – ahead of time – that good quality is cheaper in the long run – but you have to have the cash up front). And also, I have found, there are large numbers of people who do not find handwork interesting or enjoyable – to them it is drudgery… to be taken on only as a last resort. <br><br><i>Take a significant amount of the workforce out of paid employment, and two things happen: first, unemployment rates go down, and second, competition among employers for the remaining workers tends to drive wages up.</i><br><br>The fact is that this has already happened to a great extent – the US 10% unemployment that is cited does not take the “discouraged workers” into account – I have read that the real unemployment numbers (US employable population vs. number employed) are closer to 46%! So possibly your concept would be to make that situation permanent… but I don’t think there would be much shift in the actual numbers for maybe a generation.<br><br>The other objection – well, not objection so much as “how do we get there?” – is the social issue. As you pointed out, there is a stigma attached to household work (though I am very glad to say that the younger generation seems to be getting wise to this and are thumbing their nose to pure career-identity). I have encountered the depression of both men and women who – willingly or out of necessity – took on the house, and it doesn’t take long before they have a very low view of themselves. You mention you are a “former house husband” – so, something caused you to switch out of that. I don’t want details (I won’t get them, I’m sure ;-}) but I wonder that part of our culture pushes people to consider householding as a temporary option; a way to get through a certain tough patch, or to raise kids (so many of my women friends couldn’t wait to get back to work!) Possibly it is the isolation that happens in this culture; instead of a thriving town of householders, there is just you and the kids, or you and the wash… and Judge Judy on tv (gawdhelpus). Also, you didn’t mention the very, very human nature of association leading to attraction – if indeed men choose to be househusbands, it would then be working at both the community and workplace level – the person you hang out with suddenly becomes more attractive than the mate who you see at dinner! That is such a common situation, and it does affect your systems equation in a big way!<br><br><a href=#c4473655257807272803 title="comment permalink">4/15/10, 10:55 AM</a><br><br>

(And remember, many people meet their spouses in the college or workplace; they are in similar fields). <br><br>And I will speak from personal experience now: again, I don’t fit the group you were targeting, having recently divorced, and suddenly having no choice about who was going to have the paying job! The divorce rate in this country should make every householder (whether male or female) think twice about letting go of career skills – because finding work after being off for longer than 6 months has been demonstrated to be much, much harder! That is an unavoidable piece of the puzzle, but you didn’t mention that.<br><br>However, I did the numbers as you outlined them, and decided that in my situation the cost of commuting, auto maintenance, lunches out, etc. were in fact eating up much of the salary! I just quit a publishing company, and adjusted to part time work from home; it clearly is better to live frugally and sanely… and yes, the savings from cooking from scratch is unbelievable!<br><br>Yet I am experiencing an odd mental dichotomy: some part of me is saying my time is “too valuable” (I was a tech writer, and still do some freelance), and is still trying to insist that the money I could make just writing, and then hiring someone to do the physical work, pencils out better… it is only the psychological savings that has swayed me – the workplace of today (in any field, as far as I can tell!) has become insanely pressured, and no amount of money would pay for that stress… and wages are dropping, so the equation is even more clear.<br><br>I appreciate your clear description of various dilemmas, and the opportunity to think them through and reply. One thought that this and your last posts have brought to my mind is a series of small repair shops springing up in small towns, with a push toward buying things that can be repaired… if I knew there was a shoe repairperson around, I’d buy the better shoes! If I knew there was a small appliance repair shop, I’d shop around for older, repair-able items. So this could be a place where small business has a niche – create repairable goods and advertise them as such.<br><br><a href=#c3160955895988435039 title="comment permalink">4/15/10, 10:57 AM</a><br><br>

Just because one drops out of full-time paid employment doesn't preclude the possibility of doing anything at all for money. There are opportunities for freelancers, consultants, contract workers, temps, etc. Even a lot of those stereotypical stay-at-home housewives would take in laundry or do some sewing work or sell eggs or baby sit or whatever, just to earn a little bit of their "own" money.<br><br>2. The main reason why families need at least one parent working in full-time paid employment is to get health insurance cover. That is a powerful, overwhelming driving force. Breaking the employment - health insurance link would do much to "rationalize" our economy. Unfortunately, that wasn't even on the table during the recent health care finance deliberations, and it is thus unlikely to be revisited any time soon.<br><br><a href=#c1453137128660047999 title="comment permalink">4/15/10, 11:37 AM</a><br><br>

It is reinforced by the credit-culture that we've been living in for the past 4 or 5 decades. No one is used to living on their real energy or cash income any more, whether they are human beings or corporate beings.<br><br>Now, about the household economy part - I'd like to put in a word for a hybrid household economy and/or other variations.<br><br>In our case, we have a home based consulting business and also sell business-aimed programming tools. My husband does the high-tech parts (not that they have anything to do with his PhD in Electrical Engineering, most of it is self-taught stuff), I handle sales booths, phones, mail, some of the bookkeeping, some of the advertizing, etc. Fundamentally we own the store we work in, and live above it. <br><br>While I'm on call for the business all the time, my usual work load is 2 hours a day ... but the wireless phone comes out with me as I work the garden, make the bread, hang the laundry, or in today's big project, spend 8 hours smoking a brisket.<br><br>My husband's 'commute' is walking into the garage/lab. Our son, who is in college, does commute to that, and does the shopping on the way home. <br><br>It works for us.<br><br>That said ...<br><br>The childcare costs part of the equation. while they can be terribly expensive when a family has multiple young children, is less of an expense once children are in school full time (infant care is the REAL killer expense, for that matter). If parents are in jobs they love in a field they love and want to advance in, expensive child care can be a temporary high cost that they choose to invest in.<br><br>Frondly, Fern<br><br><a href=#c343230266890069365 title="comment permalink">4/15/10, 11:37 AM</a><br><br>

And thanks for sending me to reread "the Waking," which I hadn't thought about in awhile. Very apt.<br><br>My family has always had a thriving domestic economy, with the benefits of more time, good home-cooked food and well-brought-up children others have mentioned. My husband has always had the full time job. I staved off some of the stuck-at-home isolation some posters have mentioned by working part time and volunteering. My jobs have always been local with little required in the way of commuting/clothes/extra expenses. <br><br>By living frugally we have managed to avoid much of the indebtedness and economic distress that so many are enduring these days. Of course we haven't been on any extended vacations lately, either. Modesty rules. <br><br>My husband would love to work part time as well, but there's that pesky insurance problem.<br><br>However, I do realize that our strong marriage has made this choice possible. I don't think I now could get a full time job that would be enough to support me or anyone else. I did go through a few years when people would ask me when I was going to "do something" with my education, and sometimes wished I had a real profession to call my own and give me a socially viable identity. But, given the choice between home economy and daily incarceration in a cubicle performing a specialized function, home wins, hands down.<br><br>I also think that the breadwinner must value the other partner's work as being a real contribution. Otherwise, since power tends to flow to him (or her) as has the mostest money, problems can ensue: the "you stay home and cook, therefore I guess you're my servant" meme being the most common, followed by "what is it that you do all day while I'm out working hard?"<br><br>Too much cannot be said for the value of healthy relationships, when, or <i>especially</i> when living somewhat counter to prevailing social norms--though less counter in the future?<br><br><a href=#c3675272319825227402 title="comment permalink">4/15/10, 1:34 PM</a><br><br>

I'm afraid I can't source it; I know I heard it from a science fiction author, in a book of his explaining modern science to wannabe sci-fi writers or fans, but damned if I remember who. Maybe Charlie Stross.<br><br>Our anonymous science fiction author was contemplating the wonders of nanotechnology, and how soon we'd be able to develop artificial catabolic enzymes. He did some calculations, and the <i>power</i> that could be obtained from enough of these babies astounded him! And they'd likely be able to catabolize reactions involving any of a huge number of organic compounds - why, they could even be fueled with ordinary grass! And the waste products wouldn't be the nasty, toxic gasses produced by internal combustion engines. In fact, the wastes could probably be used as a garden mulch, or even a fertilizer! Enthused at the possibilities of his revolutionary new environmentally friendly personal transporter, he went to show his calculations to a friend. This wise friend looked at his notes and said: "You know what you've done, don't you? You've just invented the horse."<br><br>As the Kids these days would say, I LOL'd.<br><br><a href=#c4076107421044182742 title="comment permalink">4/15/10, 3:17 PM</a><br><br>

A few comments, though: <br><br>Dltrammel, it used to be fairly common for unmarried people who were middle-aged or older to pair up with somebody else in the same situation. (Some of those were gay couples, of course, but by no means all.) It also used to be common for unmarried aunts and the like to find a home with a married-with-kids sibling or cousin. <br><br>Neon, according to Hindu calculations, the Kali Yuga still has many centuries to run, so don't get your hopes up. <br><br>Rhisiart, yes, Stuart's nonresponse was one of the things I had in mind when I was writing this. <br><br>Llewellyn, good question. I'll be discussing the Singularity mythology in a future post -- it'll be a while, as I'm waiting for a particular event before starting that sequence of discussions. <br><br>Jason, the tone is quite deliberate. There are few better ways to get somebody to think about doing something than to suggest that they aren't bright enough to do so. <br><br>Bev, I'm afraid the term "femivore" is just a bit too cannibalistic for me!<br><br>Bill, yes, I'm writing more or less full time these days, and Sara has a part time job from home; once we get the last of our debts cleared away, we'll revisit that. <br><br>Isis, there's a reason why people used to choose prospective spouses for their reliability and economic prospects, rather than romantic love. Mind you, these days being employed in the money economy is no guarantee against ending up unemployed with no prospects, but that's another matter.<br><br>Edde, not yet.

Taking an example. In the villages in mid-Cornwall (St. Dennis and Nanpean) when my grandparents were in their youth and even when my father was a boy there were literally dozens of businesses in each village. Now there are only a few and most people will travel to larger towns (or edge of town shopping establishments) for most services, goods and employment. <br><br>There is an audio tour of St. Dennis in the 1960s the first two parts of which are available to stream from the BBC Cornwall website. <br><br>Search "BBC - Historic St. Dennis".<br><br>I think there needs to be a balance between generalism and specialism. Perhaps in a collection of a few hundred people in a village, there will be some who enjoy making jams and preserves and become talented in doing so, some who prefer to bake bread, some who have a plot of land on which they grow vegetables, someone else who opens a repair shop in their garage. <br><br>The idea that the individual household must each do all of the above is perhaps an idea which is shaped by late 20th century Western (and especially American) individualism rather than any broader principles.<br><br>The erosion of community life actually contributes to the death of the household economy. <br><br>Why bother making a good saffron cake if there's no community organisation to show it off to at a "tea treat"?<br><br>The "Old Cornwall Society" is an 90 year old institution in Cornwall which exists for the purpose of being cultural conservers. It has published a journal since 1925. That's effectively 150 years of people's memories, thinking of someone who was in their 70s in the 1920s. <br><br>If I manage to live in Cornwall full-time after I finish my PhD - I will become involved with this organisation. It could do with some younger members, particularly ones who see the relevance of its work to the future.<br><br><a href=#c124520920425385823 title="comment permalink">4/15/10, 4:44 PM</a><br><br>

(This is in your old stomping grounds.)<br> <br>What will I do on my stable when the ship of state starts taking on water? I intend to have a good line of working Quarter horses and stock dogs to train and sell. And when I'm not training either one I'll be working in a big garden, tending fruit and nut trees as well as multiple vine fruits, more than we can personally consume in a year, (trade goods). <br> <br>I have no close family I have any interest in inviting to come live with me but I do have a couple of girls in mind to be my heirs, both showing promise in horsemanship. I think well of both of them.<br> <br>When the stable is built even when I've only a few boarders I'll still have an indoor area to train year round, an important consideration since I'm past the half century mark.<br> <br>The style of building for the stable and my personal dwelling is ancient needing little extra maintenance for generations, being easy to maintain even temperatures naturally year round.<br> <br>I look forward to stepping out the back door and walking a hundred yards to 'my job.' I won't be standing still on improving the soil on the property either.<br> <br>Most likely, with at least four women living there we'll all pitch in on the household economy.

The question "so, what do you do?" is a powerful social tool in which to establish the pecking order.<br><br>It was also great to see so many people speaking about their own experiences and situations, although everyone tends to normalise their own circumstances regardless. <br><br>We'll eventually come full circle back to where we started before the Industrial Age (unless we totally destroy the environment in the process), although there will almost certainly be far less of us by then.<br><br>The English legal system has a wonderful concept of "station" which you could quite literally interpret as class, caste etc. I often wonder whether in the industrial world as individuals have reached beyond our station. How many people identify themselves with say the middle class and they set themselves up to reach for all of the trappings of that class? It's a recipe for disappointment and a source of revenue for companies which sell useless stuff that we think that we may need in order to provide social validation.<br><br>It also surprises me how many comments refer to a basic lack of household skills or the lack of time to undertake those skills. We all need to focus on those basic skills and reduce debt as they are the insurance policy that will provide a buffer for the age of decline that is to shortly come.<br><br>In addition to this I have noticed that it is women that lack social and family support networks that struggle the most with child raising. Children make poor company. We have decided not to have children and as such are fairly impartial observers. I noticed that some comments referred to isolation and maintenance of sanity. The current tendency towards having single family households is a recent aberration. It would be more appropriate to have other family members providing support and useful services within the household economy, even at the expense of the real economy. The central point though is that like a village, they must provide useful support and services otherwise they are simply another mouth to feed and support.<br><br>As a child of a single parent household I'm often surprised at the strength of gender stereotypes. It would be useful if parenting partners treated each other as equals and in the situation where both partners work the domestic load was shared. From my observations this is not often the case and women take up the larger share of the domestic economy and as a result everyone is diminished.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><a href=#c4961493157855939585 title="comment permalink">4/16/10, 2:28 AM</a><br><br>

If I'm not studying the chemistry of saponification, I'm absorbed the mysteries of fermentation. If I'm not investigating the goings on in our beehive, I've got my field guide out, and I'm trying to ID the newest bird in our backyard. If I'm not studying herbalism to make medicine, I'm considering the changing path of the sun and its relationship to our solar cooker. Heck, even making my own cleaning supplies is sort of fun. I doubt a day goes by when I don't learn something new. <br><br>Absorbed as we are in these pursuits--where work and play blend--my husband and I have zero desire to entertain ourselves by buying things--which is a good thing, because we're both writers. We work at home and make very little money. But we regard restricted income a liberation instead of a burden. If we had more money, we wouldn't change a thing. Well, no, that's a lie. The one thing we'd buy is more land, so we could keep livestock--and tackle a new learning curve.;)<br><br>I connect the degradation (and denigration) of homemaking with rise of the instant, the canned, the shrink-wrapped and pre-prepared--as well as the banishing of small livestock and kitchen gardens from cities. We lost a lot when we traded art for convenience. <br><br>But I do see lots of encouraging signs of it coming back. I teach this stuff, and our students are enthusiastic--people of all ages. I love introducing students to the wonders of worms, or watching their faces light up when they taste their first salad made of "weeds." Kids in their 20s may be maligned for being too jacked in to e-culture, but some of them really get it, and want to make change.<br><br><a href=#c5869799131582355362 title="comment permalink">4/16/10, 3:40 PM</a><br><br>

The overall idea of course is to simply drop consumption levels down by not buying or participating in the consumerist system. Extract one piece at a time, let the globalized multinational entities fade when you withdraw your support from them. Support local farming, single income households, unplug yourself from your TV, throw them out ideally. The solutions aren't hard, I think of it as the 5% fix, that is, if 5% of the population really does this, the system will begin to bend, not because you want it to, but because it must, remove the funding, that is the major weakness of this system, and it can do virtually nothing if you simply refuse to pay or play the game. The Tea Partyers know the value of that key 5%... It's not nearly as hard as people make it out to be, it simply requires a commitment to do as you say, not to just babble and type online missives endlessly while buying your next iPhone, iPad, or Prius.<br><br><a href=#c3819691050279036674 title="comment permalink">4/16/10, 5:49 PM</a><br><br>

If we go to a one income model, it will have to involve a reduction in consuming. The less we consume, the worse the economy will be and less jobs.

But alterations to business as usual will not change the collapse that is probably inevitable. They may delay but that is it. Rapid population decline combined with rapid and radical consumption decline is our only hope of having any chance of avoiding the collapse.

You ain't 'seen' nothin' yet!<br><br>Many people may have guessed I'll be using earth bags. For the size stable I want to build that's going to be a very LARGE hole in the ground which will make a fantastic farm pond. My best friend is already envisioning perch, both large and small mouthed bass and the attendant hybrids. (Yet another food source.) The run off from the arena and stable will go first into those ugly, expensive, plastic cisterns you can buy at the grange to supplement the well water. The overflow will be channeled into first a cattail bed (for cleansing the water) and on into the pond. There are boo coup uses for cattails including food and insulation for outdoor wear, (the fluff is buoyant and was used in WW II in life vests), I might even convert some into paper. And in the summer time I can use the pond to irrigate a few pastures. Hmmm, wonder if I could grow wild rice in the pond? I'll have to do some research!<br> <br>My dwelling as I envision it will be basically a modern version of a Hacienda. A large house on one corner, a detached 'garage' on the second, small stable on the third, dog kennels across the back wall and a greenhouse on the fourth corner butting up to the 'outdoor furnace' for radiant heat for the house floors and the green house. On the walls of the courtyard and buildings I'll espalier some of the more delicate edible fruit vines. I'll also be looking into the area adapted olive trees, a dozen or so for eating, cooking oil and soap making.<br> <br>And with the 'hacienda' being built I'll have another pond, although smaller, that in need could be used to keep my garden and cultivated trees watered. Maybe I'll plant papyrus in that one? Definitely water chestnuts! Oh, and don't forget sun chokes / Jerusalem artichokes!<br> <br>I always try to find more than one use for a feature as well in the case of building with earth bags the absence of soil.

I am well educated and that was of even more advantage to my children.<br><br>By now, I am divorced (my ex-husband behaved so badly that I could not continue) and so I am unemployed, very poor (though able to live on very little) and skilled at those things that earn very little also. The quality of my handmade clothing and hand-knitted socks is good. The vegetables from my garden are healthy and inexpensive and I am very happy and un-stressed... just unable to repair those things in my house that need it... and some of them are dire. <br><br>I wouldn't swap my life now, but it seems a little unfair to be so very poor after such a lot of work. <br><br>Whichever partner stays at home to care for the household, children and/or the household economy will be less employable and poorer in the long run. I would love to be able to find a way of earning money... many people who are at home would like to and are conned by "earn money at home" advertisements, but the rate of pay for household work is very low. I have sewed for other people and as an outworker for garment manufacturers, but even that is no longer possible... I can't buy fabric as inexpensively as comparable Chinese made garments. I sell jams and preserves for enough to pay for sugar and spices. I have cleaned other people's houses. But to earn enough to be able to pay for the registration of my car or the petrol to run it is very difficult.

My heartfelt empathy goes to you.<br><br>I think we've all been conned in the 20th C by the myth of love as a foundation for lifelong partnership. Trading one's options forever on a promise of'love' is not a good bet. Hedging is VERY costly. It means establishing the means of independent existence exactly at the point in life when you are 'in love' and want to settle down to enjoy wedded bliss and babies.<br><br>The truism is, you can't have everything you want at the same time. The 20s are when you establish qualifications and also seek a mate and start a family. The price of lifelong independence is establishing your qualifications while starting your family - a choice that consigns you to ten, maybe fifteen years of no discretionary time, acknowledging that the bulk of your salary is going into trade for others' time. In the short term, this is a sucker's bet, and fuels the argument for dropping out. In the long term, if you are survival minded, it means that if the marriage dissolves you have your own credentials and are not mired in poverty. <br><br>What kept me going was the knowledge that I was trading slavery now for freedom in the future. <br><br>My children have turned out well: centered, capable, and very aware of 'system costs' in the choices they make. My 'system cost' was the net sum of options over my lifetime. Doing nothing but working, studying, and childrearing - and sleeping three hours a night - over that first decade or so laid the foundation for their college educations with no student loan requirement to burden them now.<br><br>As in the majority of cases, my marriage ended. But the early years of strung out focus and work-study-household obligations that permitted only three or four hours of sleep paid out. I have a reputation and credentials. I am able to think clearly and ruthlessly, if need be. I will always opt for freedom.<br><br>Jane, I wish I had known somebody like you during the strung out years. I would happily have traded half my salary for your able assistance in running my household while I was laying my foundation for independence. Perhaps you could establish this kind of partnership with similarly strung out women. You are worth your weight in gold to them.<br><br>JMG - please acknowledge that the partner who gives up her options and her future freedoms for the sake of staying at home gets royally screwed on occasion. And that part of self reliance must include building up a stock of intellectual capital that will permit survival on your own. As we have seen, selling knit and canned goods doesn't cut it. IMHO, Systems thinking implies you can't discount the need for cash - especially as a discarded woman - while waiting out the hundred years of long decline, at which point knitting and canning will once again assume economic viability.<br><br>Great post and thought provoking, as usual.

I am wondering if there might be some interesting parallels there between how organisms in general change their environment, adapt to it, compete within it and exploit available resources in a natural ecosystem and how humans change their economic environment, adapt to it, compete within it and exploit available resources in what could be called a man-made "econosystem."

Her words are extremely pertinent to this thread and the discussions we need to be having about whole systems approach as the analogy of our [mis]understanding of soil systems can be applied to many scenarios in which we neglect to take into account the underlying processes that feed into the goods and services we use. Here's a couple of quotes from the address and I'll post the link at the bottom.<br><br>"...it is argued that organic farming is less efficient, that it has to rely on re-cycling which is wasteful, so that were it to be adopted, world food production would inevitably be lower, particularly production of protein, at a time when what we need is to produce ever more per acre...Certainly we need to produce more per acre. Unfortunately the yardstick of modern economics is to measure the efficiency by production per man."<br><br>And:<br><br>"Contrary to the views held by some, I am sure that the techniques of organic farming cannot be imprisoned in a rigid set of rules. They depend essentially on the outlook of the farmer. Without a positive and ecological approach it is not possible to farm organically. The approach of the modern conventional farmer is negative, narrow and fragmentary, and consequently produces imbalance. His attitude to 'pests' and 'weeds', for example, is to regard them as enemies to be killed--if possible exterminated. When he attacks them with lethal chemicals he seldom gives a thought to the effect this may have on the food supply or habitat of other forms of wildlife among whom he has many more friends than foes. The predatory insects and the insectivorous birds are obvious examples.<br><br> The attitude of the organic farmer, who has trained himself to think ecologically, is different. He tries to see the living world as a whole. He regards so-called pests and weeds as part of the natural pattern of the Biota, probably necessary to its stability and permanence, to he utilized rather than attacked. Throughout his operations he endeavours to achieve his objective by co-operating with natural agencies in place of relying on man-made substitutes. He studies what appear to be nature's rules - as manifested in a healthy wilderness--and attempts to adapt them to his own farm needs, instead of flouting them.<br><br> One of the first things be will notice about a natural eco-system such as a Wilderness or a Natural Forest is Balance and Stability. The innumerable different species of fauna and flora that go to make up such a community, achieve, as a result of their interdependence, whether in cooperation or competition, collective immortality. Seldom, if ever, is any species eliminated; seldom, if ever, does any species multiply to pest proportions. Thus the organic farmer, if he has a crop badly attacked by some pest, let us say, (and this can happen, even to organic farmers!) recognises that this is a symptom of imbalance in his local environment, and he first looks to see if some faulty technique of his own has been responsible--often it has."<br><br>http://www.soilandhealth.org/01aglibrary/010116Balfourspeech.html<br><br><a href=#c6970917082172952768 title="comment permalink">4/17/10, 9:59 PM</a><br><br>

It's been said that dollars represent a claim on human labor. An acceptance of that premise virtually guarantees a lower standard of living for the majority of humans living within an environment of declining energy stocks.<br><br> The Federal Reserve's response to the cheap energy premised housing bubble collapse, has been to exchange soured r.e. assets for assets backed by the full faith and credit of the US government. Seeing as how the US dollar serves as reserve currency for much of the world, the expansion of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet has significant implications for the broader labor market.<br><br> As economic expansion halts, certainly dollars become dear for those struggling to repay debts, while digital dollars transferred to the largest of banks sit on their balance sheets waiting for real estate asset prices to improve (unlikely), a come to Jesus moment of loss recognition (also unlikely), or another asset class waiting to be recognized as a storehouse of value and thus worthy of capital deployment.<br><br>It's a bit esoteric, but the concept can best be explained as physics v. hubris. To be completely subjective concerning the coming decline in human "standards of living", or living at all for that matter, is almost impossible. For me anyway.<br><br><a href=#c8184696789141374363 title="comment permalink">4/18/10, 7:05 AM</a><br><br>

The same "single income" effect may be achievable by two earners each working part-time jobs. If they have children, they can stagger their schedules so someone is always home to care for them. <br><br>Actually, this is even possible with full-time employment, depending on what it is. This is what my wife and I do. She works from home as a web designer and I work as a farmer. When I can, I take our son with me to work in the gardens or to tend the chickens. If I'm going to be doing something more dangerous, he stays at home and plays while his mom works on the computer. If she needs to meet with a client, she schedules it with me ahead of time so I can arrange to be home. Neither of us bring in a lot of money this way, but together, it's about a single income.<br><br>One of the traps of buying into the single income strategy is the belief that it is inherently economical. This isn't so. If a couple has no children, walk to work, and have lunch at home, dress casually at work, and already do all their own housework, they don't save anything by having one person stay home. Any quality of life increase gained by having more time together in the evenings (because the stay-at-home person is getting the housework done while the earner is away) may well be negated by the stress of poverty if the stay-at-home person isn't doing anything to actually generate money with their domestic activities. A shiny floor doesn't pay the bills. :)<br><br>One thing we've found essential is the idea that everything should either generate money or at least not cost anything. Most of the things we do for recreation are potential sources of income. When we make a purchase, one of the key questions we ask is "how will this pay for itself?" <br><br>This approach causes a shift in perception. I scarcely ever step foot into a store like JCPenny or the like, because they have nothing I'd be interested in buying. Our clothes come from thrift stores or discount department stores. A bunch of the other stuff--fancy curtain rods and holiday-themed tableware and knicknacks to show off smelly candles and ruffly skirts to put around the bottom of the bed--we just flat out don't use and couldn't fathom spending money on. <br><br>To be sure, this shift in values creates a rift between us and our middle-class families, the women of which make shopping for such things their chief recreational activity. We don't value what they value.<br><br>I was speaking with a man I met in the Peak Oil community who expressed that his biggest problem in preparing was convincing his wife that it was necessary. He wants to get started growing things while she wants to "invest" for their retirement. <br><br>I'm apprehensive about this social divide. At a time when families will need each other most, it may be that some members will be dragging the rest of the family down by denying that there's a problem.

Tonight Episode 2 (of 6) will air. For those of you who actually have TVs and get TVO, this is a series that is not to be missed.<br><br>The wiki page on the show has all the links you'll need to get the drift of the series:<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Farm<br><br>What is most certainly "On Topic" about this show is its immense popularity in the UK. Perhaps the message of sustainable living is creeping back into the collective myth on a sub-conscious level more widely and quickly than is commonly recognized.<br><br>Despite the cozy bedtime stories proffered by the mainstream agents of the failing Keynesian Krackpot paradigm of perpetual growth through the magic of debt - er, I mean, Credit - perhaps a last vestige of economic sense yet survives in enough minds to make a difference: if it sounds too good to be true; it IS too good to be true.<br><br>Borrow and spend your way to prosperity? One of the many wise things that Adam Smith had to say is germane to that nonsense (I paraphrase): that which is prudent for a household can hardly be less so for an entire nation.<br><br>That thought should be kept in mind for the next time you hear one of these monetary Krackpots speak of the "paradox of thrift", or the great Dr. Greenspan himself attempt to lay the blame for this on-going economic debacle on "excess savings" by those pesky and economically “unsophisticated” Asians.<br><br>The authors of financial mass-destruction want to be in charge of the remedy, and, so far are getting their way. What a travesty! Whether this is the predictable result of following the tenets of a horribly flawed theory (Keynesianism) that is the wishful opposite of the truth, or a manifestation of the Hegelian Dialectic (Thesis = Classical Political Economy - Antithesis = Keynes - Synthesis = Global Corporatism), or, indeed both, for the two are not mutually exclusive, is impossible to know at this stage.<br><br>Speaking for the former is the long history of bumbling rises and falls of cultures and civilizations which seem to be able to learn - and re-learn - only the hard way.<br><br>Speaking for the latter is the realization that what is at stake is the ultimate power of King Midas. Wealth is Power and to create wealth is therefore to create Power ... except for the little flaw which it is the goal of this blog to point out ... Money is not Wealth, and the power to create it - the power to "turn stones into bread" that Lord Keynes arrogated to his puny theory is but an illusion.<br><br>Power over the minds of men can twist perception into mis-conception, and largely - in the realm of economics - has done so, but perhaps the massive appeal of a throw-back reality TV show like “Victorian Farm” demonstrates that people, by-and-large, still understand the difference between stones and bread.<br><br><a href=#c3583806685861686044 title="comment permalink">4/19/10, 11:23 AM</a><br><br>

For me, the low-tech solution is sometimes less attractive than the high-tech, but I believe I need to practice and I'll be grateful later on!<br><br>On the topic of those who can't give up technology, I have been re-reading Rollo May's "The Courage to Create" (great book!) and he has a pertinent observation, from the 70's: <br><br><i>Such channeling of creativity into techical pursuits is appropriate on one level but serves as a psychological defense on a deeper level. This means that technology will be clung to, believed in, and depended on far beyond its legitimate sphere, since it also serves as a defense against our fears of irrational phenomena.</i><br><br>Very prescient! It's really amazing how much of this stuff was known back in the 70's (and earlier) and yet not acted on or paid attention to... <br><br>Anyway, great discussion!<br><br><a href=#c2232480623732757946 title="comment permalink">4/19/10, 6:46 PM</a><br><br>

On one hand, money fetish has a blinding effect to systems of energy economy, on the other hand there is general blindness to money system. <br><br>We should state the obvious, these two types of blindness are two sides of the same coin - literally.<br><br>The current money system of fiat monopoly money is based on debt and interest. Systemic thinking at simplest level (we are often most blind to most simple things) suggests very strongly that in degrowth environment money system based on debt and interest that require continuous growth won't survive. It's no secret that the current money system is a pyramid scam (the truth is staring at you from the one dollar bill, if you havent noted it). And self-evident systemic truth about all pyramid scams is that they collapse.<br><br>Can't wait and good riddens.<br><br>Now, what is fun and interesting about fiat-principle and internet is that as banksters do, anyone can create a money system out of thin aire, local money systems are well known but so are also in-game money systems and markets in on-line multi-roleplaying games. Which have lead to black market currency exchange systems between in-game money systems and governement monopoly money.<br><br>Now, systemic thinking can be besides analytical also creative. If energy economy is not an obstacle for maintaining internet, internet can be used as ecologically and socially sustainable money and market exchange systems by citizens initiatives, not excluding these forming inte parallel forms of self-governance to gradually replace the system that has decided to go down with bands and money as debt.<br><br>One simple idea is internet based (at least in the beginning) fiat currency created as a citizens salary for all participants (with inbuilt system of monetary equality that prevents too much money ending up in the hands of few and most being dire straits). Now that every citizen has money, the purchasing power of that money depends simply from what they produce to the exchange market. Communal free market system. <br><br>Anyone can create their own money system, creative systemic thinking allowed, if it gains momentum and starts rolling with positive feed-back mechanisms, anything can happen.<br><br>Indlucing making the internet worth keeping around.

I knit, I can make socks, but the yarn available to me, without buying fleece and spinning it myself, costs more than an equivalent pair of socks, such as "smart wool" socks. And I can't even hope to buy yarn that competes with my brand-name organic socks retailed at health food stores. These socks last me many years, and cost 1/4 of the equivalent yarn.

You're missing some of the other things our local TT initiative is doing as well: next month it's a family bike day with multiple people (including me) demonstrating how to maintain and tune your bike. Sewing we haven't done yet, and I only know a couple of ladies who still know how to turn a collar, so we'd best get that going, too, before it's too late to reclaim the skill. We've been teaching cooking, and a couple of our members run community gardens in town. Canning workshops will happen in canning season, of course.<br>I really enjoy your choice of words, as in "the household economy collapsed, or survived only as a dowdy sort of hobby practiced by the insufficiently fashionable." Fortunately, I have always been insufficiently fashionable, so the transition to dowdy househusband was probably easier for me than for others.

In terms of the general problem you addressed, blindness to whole systems, I think there are many problems that perpetuate this blindness. Increasing complexing forces people into increasingly smaller niches where they are only working on very small parts of a system. The education system and media perpetuates this specialization and trains people to think in a way that ignores the whole system. Lets use an example of an engineer designing a highly efficient electric hot water heater. He may be the brightest engineer in the world, but fail to ask the really important questions, because he has been trained his entire life to have a very narrow focus to be able to work on such complex technologies. If he would look at the whole system of the house and supplying it with energy for various uses, he would quickly come to the conclusion that electric hot water heating is a very poor choice and other options like solar or gas would be much more efficient.<br><br>To quote Dick Proenneke,<br>"Too many men work on parts of things.

Interesting discussion. Sadly, I didn't have time to read all of the 143 comments, but I did read about a quarter of them and didn't see this mentioned in them, so I thought I should mention it:<br><br>Your one-income-family model takes some things for granted, too:<br><br>- (professional) work needs to be full-time<br>- commutes are long and done by car<br>- childcare will always have to be paid entirely by the family. <br><br>None of these are in fact quite so set in stone. I'd argue that a setup in which people worked shorter hours closer to home, and childcare was strongly subsidized (by taxes, which, granted, would have to be paid by families, too - but would distribute the cost more equally across society) would work just as well to increase quality of life, strengthen the home economy, and create a more sustainable way of life. Plus, it would reduce the risk of dependency that people - rightly, I think - see as one of the biggest problems of the one-income-family.<br><br><a href=#c838286994944732225 title="comment permalink">5/14/10, 6:10 AM</a><br><br>

And yet we spend what free time we have hunting, fishing and gardening, presumably because we like thse activities - in other words, voluntarily doing the 'jobs' that allowed us to subsist on this planet for most of our history. What exactly are we getting from spending the vast majority of our days and hours of living laboring in the industrial ecomony, only to gain breif glimses of satisfaction doing what we had to do to survive anyway for most of human history.
