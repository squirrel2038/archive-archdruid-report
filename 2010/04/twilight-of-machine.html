The end of the age of cheap abundant energy, as last week’s <i>Archdruid Report</i> argued, brings with it an unavoidable reshaping of our most basic ideas about economics and, in particular, economic development. For the last three centuries or so, the effective meaning of this phrase has centered on the replacement of human labor by machines. All the other measures of development – and of course plenty of them have been offered down through the years – either reflect or presuppose that basic economic shift.<br><br>The replacement of labor with mechanical energy has even come to play a potent role in the popular imagination. From the machine-assisted living of <i>The Jetsons</i> to the darker image of reality itself as a machine-created illusion in <i>The Matrix</i>, the future has come to be defined as a place where people do even less work with their own muscles than they do today. All this is the product of what an earlier post called the logic of abundance: the notion, rooted right down in the core of the contemporary worldview of industrial society, that there will always be enough resources to let people have whatever it is that they think they want.<br><br><a href=../../img/rosie-7dcf4e-g95.jpg onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border=0 id=BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5457591549233953810 src=../../img/rosie-543380-g95.jpg style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 114px; height: 150px"></a>Abandon that comfortable but unjustifiable assumption, and the future takes on a very different shape. In a world where everything but human beings will be in short supply, it makes no sense whatever to deploy increasingly scarce resources to build, maintain, and power machines to do jobs that human labor can do equally well. An example may be useful here, so let’s take Rosie the Riveter, the iconic woman factory worker of Second World War fame, and match her up against one of the computer-guided assembly line robots that have replaced so many workers in production lines in the industrial world; we might as well pit icon against icon and call the robot HAL 9000.<br><br><a href=../../img/hal-86691e-g95.jpg onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border=0 id=BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5457592241171311330 src=../../img/hal-1cb6ec-g95.jpg style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 123px; height: 123px"></a>Both of them serve the same economic function, we’ll assume, riveting parts together on an assembly line. It’s a credo of contemporary economics that HAL is more efficient than Rosie; since the term “efficiency” in contemporary economic parlance means “labor efficiency,” or in other words how much production you can get per worker, any machine is by definition more efficient than human labor. In a world of resource constraints, though, this definition of efficiency becomes very hard to justify. It may be true that HAL can work long shifts at all hours with only the very occasional break for maintenance – at least this is what the robot salesman will tell you – and Rosie cannot. Still, in a world of resource scarcity, Rosie has a crucial advantage that more than offsets HAL’s capacity for night shifts: her operating requirements are much less energy- and technology-intensive to meet than HAL’s.<br><br>We can start with the energy source used by each riveter. HAL requires electricity – quite a bit of it, within fairly tight specifications of voltage, amperage, and cycles per second. For her part, Rosie requires food, and though she’s been known to take a second helping in the factory cafeteria, her fuel needs are fairly modest compared to those of the machine. Her tolerances for variability in energy sources are also much broader than HAL’s – if you have trouble believing this, a few minutes paging through an old wartime cookbook should settle the issue.<br><br>HAL’s maintenance requirements are just as exacting. He needs lubricants that meet precise specifications, and an assortment of spare parts ranging from zinc bushings to integrated circuits, none of which he can provide for himself. All of them must be manufactured off site, and some (such as the integrated circuit) cannot be made without extremely expensive, complex facilities demanding intricate technological infrastructures of their own. Rosie’s maintenance needs, by contrast, involve little more than eight hours of sleep and a modest additional amount of food. (“I’ll have two scoops of slumgullion today, Franny, thanks; it’s been a hard shift.”)<br><br>When it’s necessary to replace HAL, a huge array of industrial facilities – mines, smelters, chemical plants, chip fabrication plants, and one or (usually) several factories – have to be brought into play to produce HAL 9100. Unlike HAL, Rosie can manufacture her own replacement, and while it will take most of two decades before Rosie Jr. is ready to tie her hair up in a bandanna and take her place on the assembly line, Rosie’s own working life is longer still, so the replacement cycle is not a problem for her. In a world with nearly seven billion people on it, of course, it’s hardly necessary to wait for Rosie herself to reproduce in order to find a new riveter, or ten thousand of them.<br><br>Finally, what happens if the economy changes so that there’s no longer a need for as many riveters, as happened (for example) at the end of the Second World War? It might be possible to retool HAL for some other industrial process, but for reasons of efficiency, most assembly line robots are designed for a very limited range of operations, and get mothballed or go to the scrap heap (to the tune of a substantial tax writeoff) when the demand for their services goes away. Rosie, on the other hand, is capable of a nearly limitless range of productive economic activities, and can head off to some other career when the factory closes down, leaving HAL to sing “Daisy May” to himself on the deserted assembly line.<br><br>All this could be developed at even greater detail, and with less whimsy, but I trust the point has been made: HAL’s appearance of greater efficiency depends on access to a support system of factories and services vastly larger than the one Rosie needs, and his support system necessarily depends on the availability of cheap abundant energy and a wide range of specialized resources and supplies, while hers need not do so. What makes HAL more economical in an age of resource and energy abundance is ultimately the abundant supply and low cost of fossil fuel energy. During an age of resource scarcity, the equation changes completely, because the goods and services that support Rosie can be produced with a much simpler technology, and with much less in the way of concentrated energy, than the goods and services that support HAL.<br><br>There’s a reason for this, of course: human beings evolved over millions of years in a world of energy and resource scarcity, along with all other living things. Our hominid ancestors, and all their ancestors down the lineage of evolution all the way to those first prokaryotic cells back in the dank Archean mists, spent most of their lives confronting the hard logic of Malthus by which population rises right up to the limits of carrying capacity. There are some multicellular organisms that have requirements as exacting and purposes as limited as most machines, but not many, and our species ranks right up there with rats, crows, and cockroaches among Nature’s supreme generalists.<br><br>It’s only in the highly atypical conditions of the last three centuries, then, that machines become more economical than human laborers. This is why, for example, nobody in the Roman world thought of using Hero of Alexandria’s aeolipile, the first known steam engine, as a source of power for industry or transport. Craft traditions in the Roman Empire would certainly have been up to the challenge, and the aeolipile was much discussed at the time as an interesting curiosity; what was lacking was the recognition that the black gooey stuff that seeped from the ground in certain places, or the black flammable stone we call coal, could be extracted in large quantities and turned into fuel. Lacking that, in turn, the aelopile could never have been more than an interesting curiosity, for the fuel supplies the Roman world knew about were already committed to existing economic sectors, while human and animal muscle were abundant, familiar, and cheap.<br><br>As the industrial age winds down, in turn, human muscle will again be abundant. Will it be cheap? Almost certainly, yes – and that means that real wages for most people in the industrial world will continue their current slide toward Third World levels. I wish I could say otherwise, not least because my chances of taking part in that slide are tolerably high. Still, part of what has made the last three centuries so atypical is the extent to which ordinary people in the industrial world have been able to rise out of the hand-to-mouth existence typical of most of humanity for most of history, and partake of a degree of comfort and security that monarchs of past ages have often sought in vain. That state of affairs could never have been permanent, because it was made possible only by using up fantastic amounts of fossil sunlight at a pace so extravagant that the quest to figure out what to do with all that energy has been a major driver of economic change for more than a century now; it’s simply our bad luck to live at a time when the bill for all that extravagance is coming due.<br><br>All this should be fairly straightforward and uncontroversial. It isn’t, of course, because the contemporary faith in the superiority of the machine reaches deep into the irrational levels of our collective psyche. When Lewis Mumford titled one of his most significant books <i>The Myth of the Machine</i> he was not engaging in hyperbole. The thought that Rosie the Riveter could go head to head with HAL 9000 under any conditions, and win hands down, is unthinkable to most of us; it’s a matter of folk belief throughout industrial society that the machine always wins, or at least that any victory over it is as temporary and fatal as John Henry’s Pyrrhic triumph over the steam drill.<br><br>The machine is our totem, the focus of a great deal of our culture’s sense of value and purpose, and most people in the industrial world accord it the same omnipotence that older religions claim for their gods. The sheer volume of popular culture over the last century or so that fixates on the notion of machines taking over the world, and treating humanity the way industrial humanity has so often treated other living things, is one indicator of the mythic power machines have come to hold in our collective imagination. It’s for this reason, I think, that so many of us simply can’t imagine a future in which machines will be less economically viable than human labor.<br><br>Yet if it costs the equivalent of $5 a day to hire a file clerk and a secretary at Third World wage scales, and it costs the equivalent of $10 a day in expensive and unreliable electricity to run a computer to do the same things, those businesses that hope to succeed will hire the file clerk and the secretary, and the computer will be left to gather dust. Now it’s true, as fans of computers are quick to point out, that computers will do things that secretaries and file clerks can’t, but the reverse is also true – try asking your computer sometime to go pick up takeout lunch for the office from a place that doesn’t deliver – and many of the abilities unique to computers are conveniences rather than necessities; businesses got along very well without them for thousands of years, remember.<br><br>Once again, however, this points up the value of E.F. Schumacher’s concept of intermediate technology – or, as it was usefully retitled in the Seventies, appropriate technology – for the deindustrial future. The technology that’s useful to help a human worker do his job more effectively is not the same as the technology that’s needed to replace him with a machine. As cheap abundant energy becomes a thing of the past, replacing workers with machines will no longer be a viable option, but providing workers with tools that will make their labor more productive is quite another matter.<br><br>The problem here is that very few people are used to thinking in these terms. The vast majority of thinking about appropriate technology these days still envisions it, as Schumacher did, as something to be used in Third World countries only. Worse still, while every industry in the world once had a vast amount of practical knowledge about the tools and training human workers needed to do their jobs well, nearly all of that knowledge is endangered if it hasn’t already been lost.<br><br>Consider the slide rule as one example among many. Until the 1970s, it was the engineer’s inseparable companion; every technological advance from the mid-19th century until Apollo 11 landed on the Moon was made possible, in part, by competent manipulation of this simple, flexible, ingenious tool by people who knew how to make the most of its strengths and work within its limits. Since it doesn’t require a massive and technologically complex support structure to construct, maintain, and operate them – any good cabinetmaker can make one, and their proper fuel is a scoop of the same slumgullion that kept Rosie going on her shift – slide rules are likely to be just as useful on the downslope of the industrial age as they were on the way up. If, that is, anybody on Earth still remembers how to use one when we get to that point along the curve of deindustrialization.<br><br>This is where the myth of the machine – the conviction, as irrational these days as it is pervasive, that the best person for any job is always not a person at all, but a machine – stops becoming a curious twist of our collective imagination and turns into a trap we ignore at our peril. As peak oil moves closer to center stage in the historical drama of our time, making the gargantuan technostructure we’ve built on a foundation of cheap abundant energy ever more problematic to sustain, the most common response from the centers of power and the masses alike is to call for the development of even more complex, gargantuan, and tightly interlinked machines, pushing the technostructure in the direction of greater risk and greater dysfunction. It’s hardly an exaggeration to suggest that if it turned out we were all about to perish en masse from building too many machines, the first reaction of most people in today’s industrial cultures would likely be to insist that the answer was to build more machines.<br><br>Thus we will doubtless see plenty of shiny new machines built in the years to come, and they will doubtless do their fair share and more to push industrial civilization further down the arc of its decline. As the ancient Greeks knew well, it’s the essence of tragedy that the <i>arete</i>, the particular excellence, of a tragic hero also turns out to be his <i>hamartia</i> or fatal flaw; put another way, a civilization that lives by the machine can expect to die by the machine as well. Still, among the heretical minority that has learned to mistrust the myth of the machine, it may well be worth remembering that as the age of scarcity dawns, educating people is a far more useful project than building machines, and doing as much as possible to insure that individuals, families, and communities have the skills and simple tools they need to work productively is one very promising response to the future ahead of us. We’ll talk about one application of that approach next week.

If there were 2 people capable of doing a job, and one was a highly paid contractor and the other was a data entry clerk at entry level wages … well, for grunt work, you got the less expensive resource to do the job and reserved the highly paid contractor for the trickier stuff (which is presumably what they were being paid the big bucks for anyhow). It just made sense from a bottom-line perspective. Now, that was a comparison between two human resources, but surely some clever bean counter who thinks outside the box will, at some point, observe that human hands could do a job for less cost than maintaining/replacing the machines and propose the change to management. <br><br>It’s actually one of the things I fear when I look at my own job’s future: I work on software that is extremely helpful to our customers, but it’s not absolutely necessary … people with ledger books and careful paper records could do the job – they have before, and no doubt will again. When I’m out in the garden thinking “oh, I don’t feel like pulling up any more weeds, it won’t affect the harvest much if I stop now…” I remind myself that if too many people decide it’ll cost them less to go back to ledger books and paper, I’ll find myself with more time than money and be shopping in my back yard instead of the store … so I’d better pull those weeds.<br><br><a href=#c3346875388382132435 title="comment permalink">4/7/10, 8:54 PM</a><br><br>

We had a finger in several pies, but one particular pie, the cash cow for the company, was a world-wide fax network. Any company on the network could send a fax to any other company on the network, or via normal phone lines from our partner companies to any fax machine on the same local exchange. It sounds like a limited service now, but was very useful to our customers and very profitable for us.<br><br>Part of the way we made money from this arrangement was to sell store-and-forward fax servers to our partner companies. Since they were making a few cents on every fax they forwarded, it was easy to make those sales. They would profit, we would profit, and the faxes would go through. So we had servers set up in every major city in the non-communist world.<br><br>Except Hong Kong. <br><br>No matter the calculations we could do, no matter how many faxes were forwarded by our partner company, they would simply not buy a server. So, when one of their executives was over for a visit, I asked him why. Were they getting a better deal from someone else?<br><br>The answer was no, they were not using a fax server at all. They had hired several clerks, all women, to simply print out the faxes and send them on their way, manually. The reason they would not buy a server was that it would increase their costs by about $0.005 (1/2 cent US) per page, impinging on the profitability of the business. Since they were our only portal into mainland China, they were handling several million faxes per month, and that .005 wound up as a lot of money. That conversation opened my eyes to a lot of things I had never considered in my techno-geeky assumptions about the world.<br><br>One thing I learned is that efficiency is not a universal. One can be efficient, but only of a particular resource (time, space, labor, electricity, fuel, water, capital, design effort, computing resources, social stability, reputation, etc), but one cannot be simply "efficient", with no qualifier. And improving efficiency in one area ALWAYS requires expending resources, and thereby reducing efficiency, in another. Think of it as the 2nd law of thermodynamics (there ain't no such thing as a free lunch) expressed in terms of efficiency.<br><br>And what you efficiencies you choose to improve says a lot about what you consider important.<br><br><a href=#c2554903055276753504 title="comment permalink">4/7/10, 9:12 PM</a><br><br>

You are overlooking the education/training requirement to "retool". I fear deindustrialization will destroy the generalist education foundation we take for granted in the US. That, and the way book publishers are going broke, going digital (retiring printing apparatus and the people that understand printing), and turning out ever cheaper, less robust products. Though most of my purchases in recent years have been (science) fiction, the number of broken bindings, shed pages, faded (thirsty) ink - are all increasing. We may not have the documents to support general education, in a post-industrial environment. Yes, I know that the content of today's reference books is often slanted and incomplete anyway.<br><br>And I have to take issue with the dynamics of your stand on human vs. machine applications.<br><br>Your opening paragraphs illuminated a thought for me. The allure of affluence. That is, if I might define affluence as "freedom from rote labor".<br><br>In slave-holding cultures, in cultures with lower classes, and any time there are affluent and non-affluent, much of the measure of affluence is causing work to be accomplished without personally performing direct labor. Investment? A second derivative removed from direct labor, thus very attractive, for the savvy. Government I might consider a third derivative removed from direct labor.<br><br>I consider replacing human effort with machine as being an expression of conspicuous consumption - affluence. Just as hiring others to tend the garden, the fields, the house, one's personal needs was at one time a privilege of the affluent, machines or commercial equivalents - grocery stores, convenience stores, etc. - cheap energy provide the machine and vast personal transportation <i>range</i> to afford even the very slightly affluent similar indulgence.<br><br>Anyone deliberately choosing to perform rote work will necessarily have to redefine affluence - or redefine their role in society as "subsistence". I don't think there can be a middle ground.<br><br>We will need to recognize and elevate an informal economy, to reposition those needed for rote work and enable them to perform needed tasks.<br><br>We will need to redefine poverty. Rather than an absence of affluence, poverty should not be defined by performing rote labor. Poverty should be insufficient means to acquire, without thieving, clothing adequate to current exposure, food adequate to work and effort required and maintain health sufficient to accomplish the work required. <br><br>We have to acknowledge that we need affluent people to provide direction and security to the community and nation; and that not many can be affluent in terms of cash or relief from rote labor.<br><br>Class mobility may turn out to be a function of affluence. I hope not; mobility is a useful mechanism for getting the best use of the best people.<br><br>The loss of educational material and content bothers me a lot. Deindustrializing should be much simpler, if we can retain education enough to retain technological flexibility. Like how to sharpen a cross-cut wood saw, as opposed to a rip saw.<br><br><a href=#c1163325884064270190 title="comment permalink">4/7/10, 10:28 PM</a><br><br>

Very old school, but on reflection I now approve. It does train you to perform calculations quickly (practice makes perfect). Those who have always used calculators may not understand the "why" of a calculation or be able to perform them in their head or on paper. They might also be just mentally lazy. I have had the pleasure (sic) of training some generation Y graduates who have missed out on the fundamentals behind their profession and it is painful for all concerned.<br><br>At university, I remember a time before google when if you wanted to perform any sort of research it meant actually going through a card database and then microfiche records at the university or state library and then hoping that the reference material was appropriate and/or the books were actually on the shelves! <br><br>It seems to me that with the Internet, the volume of information has increased massively, but the quality of that information has decreased substantially. For example, it was not possible before mainstream acceptance of the Internet for well financed interest groups to spread misinformation about a particular topic (think clean coal, climate change deniers etc) to any great extent without having to publish a book or publication and get it stocked at a library or a university. Fast forward to today and it is relatively cheap to put up a web page with said misinformation and that page is widely available and used as a source for the general populace in the industrial world. Even worse it is often relied upon by the media and politicians who end up repeating the misinformation. Critical thinking and independence is quickly becoming a lost art. I don't think that this is a good thing for anybody.<br><br>Apple Jack Creek referred to the fear of manual ledger systems replacing software and I would like to add that this is a very real fear indeed. It was not that long ago that small to medium enterprises used manual paper based accounting systems. It might surprise younger people than myself, that computers and the associated software have only been powerful enough and cheap enough to use in these businesses in the past two decades. I certainly remember "upgrading" a business in the very early 1990's with multiple offices and 100+ employees from a paper based system to a computer ledger. The computer software produced nicer looking reports in quicker time, but at the end of the day the paper based system still produced the same numbers. <br><br>One of the things that I often wonder about is that people learn to use software. I've heard people say that they know this package, but not that other package. Well, if they understood the fundamentals it shouldn't matter whether they use whatever package or do it by paper instead. The problem is that they don't understand the fundamentals. This is exactly like the use of the slide rule that you mentioned and it is a major weakness in our society.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><a href=#c1415284605670624814 title="comment permalink">4/8/10, 2:45 AM</a><br><br>

Take the leaf blower, for example. Why does this contraption even exist? It's loud and obnoxious, and spews out toxic fumes. But even more ridiculous, watching people blow leaves around their yards is about the silliest thing I've ever seen. It could make a hilarious ballet or dance interlude in a musical show.<br><br>To invoke the bard of Middle-Earth again, hobbits "do not and did not understand or like machines more complicated than a forge-bellows, a water-mill, or a hand-loom, though they were skillful with tools" (prologue to "The Fellowship of the Ring," p. 1).<br><br>Maybe I think a bit like a hobbit.

But the man and the dog might want to begin studying for their second career -- say, herding sheep. <br><br>DIYer, granted -- the internet and all won't go away at once. My sense, though, is that it will increasingly be rationed by price as energy and materials become more costly, and as less of the cost of running it gets picked up by advertising -- when most people are flat broke, after all, it doesn't make a lot of economic sense to pay lots of money to run ad campaigns to sell them products they can't afford to buy.<br><br>Apple Jack, an abacus is certainly an option, and with a little practice it's quick and easy to use. Slide rules won't do you as much good for bookkeeping, since they don't add or subtract. Still, you might look around for a few old bookkeeping textbooks from the 1950s and 1960s, and start learning the fundamentals; it's not that difficult. <br><br>Brad, I don't think anyone's going to need to redefine poverty, find a role for affluence, etc. These things will happen by themselves as the economic reality undergirding our current attitudes changes irrevocably. As for flexibility, people become remarkably flexible if the alternative is not eating!<br><br>Greatblue, you're quite right -- I'll get that corrected. <br><br>Paul, in America until the Second World War, most middle class households had a couple of servants. It's fashionable these days to disdain that habit, but it provided plenty of jobs to people who had limited intellectual possibilities but a good work ethic. <br><br>Spottedwolf, one of the things that worries me is just how extreme the tantrums will be when today's overgrown children (we have very few adults these days) find that they can't have their toys any more. <br><br>Cherokee, you've put your finger on one of the crucial issues here -- the abandonment of fundamentals in favor of a button-pushing approach in just about any profession you care to name.

Mine echoes some others’ and is, I fear, overlong, but here goes.<br><br>The central trope is apt, yet still bound by the machine--perhaps purposely. You talk about Rosie the machine part, and of course assembly lines were invented because they hadn't got robots yet. It's striking that Rosie was assembling airplanes, a prime artifact of the industrial age.<br><br>While you are using Rosie as a trope, I'm thinking about Rosie the person. I know from experience that days spent in a classic repetitive motion assembly line deaden life and spirit in the extreme, as do other purely physical jobs designed so the workers are devoid of the autonomy and creativity that distinguishes us from machines. The term wage-slaves comes to mind.<br><br>Since humans on an assembly line are a sort of apotheosis of humans serving the machine, or being required to act as though made of mindless plastic and metal within a fossil-fuel-fired complex, I wonder about the real future and how it will reflect the past. As an affluent American beneficiary of machines and industrial production, it's easy to imagine a more satisfying future full of satisfying handwork and community cooperation. Yet as a woman, I'm grateful not to have died in childbirth, and to be able to spend so much of my time reading, writing and teaching--and not so overburdened by household chores that I have time for these activities.<br><br>It's one thing to keep up one's chops vis a vis cooking, baking, handwork and gardening, yet to be able to go buy bread or clothes when one gets busy teaching or writing; and quite another to have one's family survival depend on those efforts. Not for nothing did Thoreau, despite his critique of work for gain, refuse the invitation to join the utopian Brook farm. For good reason: he needed time to write and couldn't see using up his energy in amateur subsistence farming, when real farmers could do it so much better.<br><br>It is interesting that that firm in Hong Kong hired women to perform the faxing tasks. Why not men? And while true that being a household servant could be considered a useful job for persons of limited intellectual possibilities, many servants have historically started at such young ages it might be hard to tell what their intellectual possibilities are, especially if from a lower class. I wonder how that African servant thought about things and if anyone asked him.<br><br>I dread a future that is a reboot of the past in which many men rode lightly and lived large intellectual and artistic lives dependent on the subservience of women, whether as wives or members of the troops of household servants that even moderately prosperous houses require when reliant on human labor. When people are confined to menial tasks, it's easy to think of them as parts of the machine, as lacking capacity for thought, as being unfit for such things as education and culture and intellectual work. A sweatshop full of young women producing clothing for non-living-wages under the thumb of harsh overseers is grim, whether using needle and thread in the 17th century, treadle sewing machines in the 19th century, "smart" electrical machines in the 20th and 21st centuries, or whatever we’ll use in the future.<br><br>Ursula LeGuin’s speculative fiction is instructive in this area.<br><br>Thus I find Rosie an ambiguous figure, independent and earning wages for possibly the first time in her life, yet doing so by being required to fit her work habits to monotonous machine rhythms that in other ways help deaden her mind and rob her of her humanity. And like other machine parts, discarded once the replacement parts arrived, shipped in from overseas.<br><br>(BTW, a good novel I'm reading that discusses some of these themes (including Brad K's allure of affluence) in the context of late 19th cent. England is A.S. Byatt's <i>The Children's Book</i>. It's full of lessons for us in our later empire.)<br><br><a href=#c4955240996558208981 title="comment permalink">4/8/10, 8:17 AM</a><br><br>

As you imply, its one thing to come up with an innovation which makes a persons daily activity more efficient, freeing their time to express their versatility, in other ways. Its entirely another to come up with an innovation that replaces them entirely, then ditching them. I've seen some older people who were “involved” in their work lose a sense of their value as individuals. Replaced by machine?

When I graduated from college and began working in product development, it was pointed out to me that it frequently paid to replace human labor by machinery <b>even when installing and using the machinery cost more</b>. The reason was that human labor could not produce a sufficiently consistent product; either the manufacturer had to test each item and the failures had to get reworked or the manufacturer took a financial bath on warranty claims. One of my prized possessions is a 16th century clock I inherited from my father; each tooth on each gear is exquisitely hand cut, but try to run it and eventually the wrong teeth try to mesh and the clock just...stops.<br><br>The upshot is that one can't just replace machines with human labor; the work itself must be altered to play to human rather than machine strengths.

But even though we still have relatively abundant, cheap energy at our disposal at this time, using an appliance is not always the most efficient way to get much of our everyday work done. As you mention, using many supposedly "time saving" electronic gadgets is only practical if you discount the time required to earn the extra money to buy them, the time required to earn the money to buy the electricity to run them, and the time and money spent tending to their special needs (cleaning, adjustments, lubrication, storage, repair and replacement of worn or consumable parts.) If you subtract all of these inputs, their "time saving" efficiency ratings won't look nearly so good. <br><br>Take for example, food preparation in the home. These days, when someone in our family needs a tool, we will almost always choose the human-powered version over the electrical-powered one. We don't use electric can openers, we use manual ones. If it takes an extra few seconds to open a can, what of it? Are we in *that* much of a hurry? We no longer even use a food processor to do things like chopping vegetables. Why? Dragging out an electrical appliance, putting it together, using it, and then taking it apart again to clean it back up is just too much work, especially when someone of moderate skill with nothing more than a sharp knife can do the job in the same amount of time (or less in some cases!) and leave far less mess in their wake. Even human powered machines (hand-cranked apple peelers, hand powered food mills, etc) do as good or better a job than most electrical appliances, even when processing food in volume for storage and in most cases only require slightly more work to clean than a good sharp knife and a pair of willing hands. <br><br>Realizing this has helped us to clear our cupboards of a lot of unneeded electronic gadgets over the past couple of years. The only electrical appliance I find we still regularly use is our very simple, handy-dandy stick blender. I'm still looking for a good alternative for that one!<br><br>Seriously, I think it's time we started looking at how we do work with a much more critical eye, and not just take some technogadget salesperson's word for it that our lives will be so better if only we would turn more of it over to machines.<br><br><a href=#c628581075694630364 title="comment permalink">4/8/10, 11:19 AM</a><br><br>

Subsistence poverty is an equal opportunity employer, no one has an easy ride. Has there been a time where the life expectancy of men was actually longer than that of women? If pregnancy and household drudgery were more oppressive than agricultural, military, and industrial demands and dangers, you'd expect to have seen this.

So relieving to find so much disdain. Although I once worked as a shed erector and we used the leaf blowers to remove all the little metal filings from the roof to prevent rust which was the most effective thing I've ever seen them do. Hooked up as a bellows maybe; blowing leaves around in circles, c'mon - get a rake.<br><br>I live in Hong Kong so all this talk about abacuses and the old systems is really cool.

It must be a really big computer. My I-MAC uses 110 Watts and at 12c per kilowatt-hour, that is only about 10c per day. I suspect you may have used your new slide rule to calculate this. I used one for many years and I know from painful experience how easy it is to be off by a factor of 10 (or 100)! But, this did get me thinking. Is human labor really cheaper than machine labor? <br><br>Lets take your example of hiring two people to replace a computer. We don’t know what pay rates will be in the future, so lets assume they are slaves. Even so, there is a minimum cost of labor, and that is the cost to feed them. Depending on agricultural conditions, that requires at least 1/4 acre of arable land per person or 1/2 acre for our two slaves. The computer will use about 240 kilowatt-hours of energy in a year (260 days, 8 hours per day). Assuming the grid is gone, we will need a generator. PV would be better but diesel generators are low tech and can be made in any competent machine shop from common (salvaged) materials. Not so with PV. Diesel generators consume about 0.1 gal of fuel to produce a Kilowatt-hour of electricity, so our computer needs about 24 gallons of fuel per year. Rapeseed oil makes good diesel fuel and one can harvest about 120 gallons per acre. Our computer needs only 0.2 acres of land to feed it. Less than half of what our slaves need. This is of course a poor example. Better examples can be found in agriculture, construction, transportation, and military. (I can supply examples if you would like.) Having grown up on a farm, I am convinced that farmers will grow oil crops to feed their tractors rather than hay and oats for draft horses. And, as Z suggested, wood will make a comeback as fuel.<br> As long as machines can be made, they will, precisely because they use less energy than people to accomplish the same task. This will become increasingly essential as fossil fuels deplete. <br><br>I don’t dispute the possibility that social turmoil following peak oil may well destroy our ability to make machines. You make a compelling case for that. But we should not celebrate the end of the machine.<br><br><a href=#c4402686761622458778 title="comment permalink">4/8/10, 1:52 PM</a><br><br>

If you bring in someone, give them a room to sleep in, provide meals and maybe more - you can claim them as a dependent, tax wise, rather than an employee. But that means they cannot claim any value toward social security payments, etc. <br><br>If the extra person is a roommate, paying rent, then you don't have to account for shared efforts.<br><br>@ Vera,<br><br>Efficiency, like return on investment, is always taken from some distinct person's point of view.<br><br>One measure of efficiency is how completely an enterprise consumes its budget. Another is how much effort a manager must expend, or a customer, on a given project.<br><br>Big farms are really efficient, in terms of requiring fewer implement providers, fewer ports to gather the produce and export it, fewer enterprises for the state to account for, and for the USDA to canvas every year. The feds pay attention to efficiencies like that. Seed companies and dairy companies like big farms, because the big orders and big quantities handled are simpler to arrange with big trucks - fewer drivers, fewer ads, fewer contacts. Much more efficient to serve the big farm!<br><br>While we are picking on big farms, let me consider WalMart for a moment. WalMart exploits an efficiency of lots of product moving through a relatively few very large stores. This is efficient, to stock lots of baloney in one store as opposed to some baloney in four or five stores. It is efficient of WalMart to let myriad customers commute and travel miles and miles to get to their store - WalMart isn't paying for the time the customers spend, the transportation costs they incur, to get to the big store.<br><br>Let cheap energy turn expensive, and that efficiency turns on its head. I predict that as cheap energy goes away, that WalMart will (and should!) turn to cookie-cutter neighborhood stores, perhaps every few blocks, to be near customers no longer able to travel far to get to the WalMart products. Then the efficiency will be distributing the goods to local stores, when costs prohibit gathering large crowds of customers to a central location. This is very much the same discussion as whether big farms or small farms are more efficient.<br><br>Today WalMart enjoys managing a lot of stores, and serving a great multitude of customers. In a dispersed mode, there would be much more management structure and overhead, much more distribution costs, to serve those same customers with locally available stores in their greater numbers.<br><br><a href=#c2241986193658201772 title="comment permalink">4/8/10, 8:17 PM</a><br><br>

In the long term feminism just isn't all that important.<br><br>@Ariel55<br>In the summer of 1976 (before I first met JMG) I was in the YCC, a government program that hired young people to work in the national parks and forests. My assignment was to Mt Rainier National Park. Sometime we worked out of our base camp at Longmire, other times we would go out into the backcountry for a week at a time to make improvements to campgrounds, build trails, dig latrines, pull weeds, etc. <br><br>Like any government job, some of the tasks were pointless and ludicrous, such blasting a beaver dam that threatened to wash out a road. Every two weeks. For the entire summer. The little bustards would keep rebuilding that dam, like it was their home or something.<br><br>Some were very interesting, like tearing out a 1920's era latrine from what had been, in those days, a luxury ski area. Gilt-framed mirrors, a gold-plated cistern pump handle, mauve wallpaper and mahogany seats. Very classy.<br><br>One of the jobs was to move about 12 trees into a campground (at Nickel Creek) where the trees had all been banded and killed by vandals. The trees were Douglas Firs that had been identified as candidates some 3 years before.<br><br>Now, I don't know if you've been around Doug Firs, but they grow fast. The 2-3M tall tress that had been identified as candidates had grown to triple their previous size. They were now 6-10M (20-30 ft) tall and a couple hundred kilos each.<br><br>Fortunately Doug Fir has shallow roots and no taproots. So we built a platform 2Mx2M using wood from the dead trees, and dug up the live trees a similar distance from the trunk. With some leverage we'd get the tree up onto the platform and brute force it about 200M to the campground, dig a shallow hole, and plant it. <br><br>And when I say brute force, I mean it. 8 14-18 year olds and one adult counselor, most hauling on ropes with two (the two least effective pullers) using pry bars to lever the front of the skids over any obstacles.<br><br>We could do 2 or 3 in a day. And every one of those trees had survived when I revisited that campground a few years later.<br><br>@Wordek,<br>I have no doubt you are right about the current generation of farmers when you say they would rather raise oil crops than give up their tractors, just as many farmers held on to their horse and mule teams well into the 1960s. Over the long term though, evolutionary advantage will have it's way. At some point, a farmer trying to till or harvest with a tractor will be looked upon as a a sad and slightly potty figure, or at best as "not a REAL farmer" as horse-powered small farmers are looked down upon today. <br><br>After all, if you can afford to feed that tractor, you must literally have money to burn and are just playing at farming.<br><br><a href=#c7668840977152065652 title="comment permalink">4/8/10, 9:39 PM</a><br><br>

And I mean calories, not necessarily nutrition. We're talking about cheap carbs and factory-farmed meat, not Whole Foods. But if you want to stay alive, it's not hard to do it. That's why so many poor people are obese. Cheap food isn't good for you, but it at least you won't starve.<br><br>Post peak it's a different story...<br><br>I often come across the World Made By Hand meme which is ultimately a hopeful tale in which we cast aside machines and live like neo-Amish. Happily ever after, basically. The story goes that since old-school farming is labor-intensive we will need lots of farm-hands. The more the merrier, right? Give us your poor, your huddled masses, and we'll hand them a pair of overalls and a shovel! But EROEI applies to human labor just as much as it does to machines. You can not employ an infinite number of farm hands. There is a point of diminishing returns beyond which adding more doesn't increase productivity, but just sucks away net profit.<br><br>As such, population overshoot will probably first be seen in terms of job overshoot. People may work for starvation wages, like you said, in which case they will in fact starve, which will be the invisible hand's way of balancing the scale of employee supply and demand to a point in which salaries can find some sustainable equilibrium.

You've spent a great deal of time lately analyzing the differences between the centralized, energy intensive, industrial production methods of the age of oil and the local, versatile, resilient, low energy realm of appropriate technology and I thought that you might appreciate the term <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergosophy rel=nofollow>ergosophy</a>, the wisdom of work. Coined by Frederick Soddy, the Nobel winning chemist turned rogue economist in his 1930's book <i>The Role of Money</i>. He realized that all economic activity required work, in the thermodynamic sense, and that money represents a claim on that work. On that note, I asked a while back for a term to replace economics should it ever become a proper science along the lines of chemistry replacing alchemy and I think ergosophy is a good contender.<br><br>On efficiency. Efficiency is usually expressed as a percentage, a dimensionless number, because the context is assumed to make its meaning clear. But it actually needs two units to have any meaning, an input and an output, miles per gallon, KWh per photon, labor hours per widget, etc. <br><br>On the topic of calculators and math skills. People develop the skills that are appropriate to their lives. In societies with oral traditions individuals possessed phenomenal capacity to recite lengthy tales because memory was the only method available to preserve important information. The written word eliminated that need and modern folks are consequently poorer in their faculty for remembering things verbatim.<br><br> Likewise calculators and spellcheckers reduce the need for rote arithmetic and spelling capabilities. Should little red lines cease appearing under my words as I type them then I would endeavor to memorize the myriad of ridiculous and counterintuitive spellings in the English language as literate folks did before the CPU superseded the task and doubtless will again when machines abdicate the responsibility.<br><br><a href=#c8266134053795286479 title="comment permalink">4/9/10, 12:20 AM</a><br><br>

The reality is that in the US prior to WWII the rule was incredible exploitation leading to continuous and widespread riots and rebellion, violently suppressed by the use of the military against civilians.<br><br>Eventually fear drove the creation of a middle class to serve as a buffer - a larger segment of the population with an interest in supporting the system. But that was only possible because of empire and oil. It was only really since WWII that the US has enjoyed the luxury of the kings of old. Apparently it only takes 70 years for the entire society to forget.<br><br>Now that empire and oil are failing, so too is the middle class. Without that buffer the exploitation, violence and instability are also likely to return, though I doubt it will be the wobblies and the socialists this time.<br><br>Also, the Tea Party is yet another corporate created false grass roots organization.

Interestingly, the argument can be carried to a much smaller scale and still apply. For example:<br><br>Suppose you are working in your shop and have a large number of screws to drive. Your local big box hardware store will sell you one of those battery powered screwdrivers. It will cost a fair amount upfront, require constant charging, be relatively heavy to use, suffer battery degradation during its (short) lifetime, require that battery to be replaced from time to time, and evetually be discarded in a landfill when it breaks or the battery is no longer made.<br><br>The alternative is the Yankee screwdriver. This ingenious device was invented more than a century ago. It consists of a hollow steel tube, about a foot long, with a handle on the end. The other end has a spring loaded steel rod with a helix cut into it and a screwdriver bit on the end. When you push on the handle the tube engages the helix, spinning the rod and driving the screw. Two or three good pushes will drive most screws in.<br><br>The yankee driver is as fast or faster than the battery equivalent, requires no charging, is lightweight and compact, requires for maintenance only a drop of oil on the helix every ten years or so, and can be completely recycled.<br><br>You will, however, not recycle it because it will last longer than you do. The one I use was left me by my grandfather - who died in 1955. I estimate it is about 70 years old and still looks and works as well as the day it was made. My son will own it someday. I doubt any modern battery powered tools can make that claim.<br><br>Yankee screwdrivers were common in the early part of the 20th century, but hardly anyone knows about them now. I get a warm feeling whenever I use mine, knowing that grandpa unwittingly left me a great piece of appropriate technology for the years ahead.<br><br>Yankee screwdrivers, slide rules and many other almost forgotten technologies will be rediscovered in the coming years as their 'efficient, modern' equivalents become increasingly unwieldly and impractical.<br><br><a href=#c1046958813963479931 title="comment permalink">4/9/10, 10:16 AM</a><br><br>

In effect it allows both parents and kidults to maintain an inward focus rather than look outside the family situation. It also has the benefit for the parents of delaying the acknowledgement of the ageing process and as such the kidults lose out in that bargain.<br><br>At the age of 18 I didn't think anything about moving from the family nest. From my current perspective I wonder whether I hit on the peak of the bell shaped resources curve and if share houses are an anomally. I considered them a right of passage and they also provided the useful service of having strangers not tolerate behaviours that family otherwise would (normalisation). However, people in general appear to be tribal in nature and don't wish to go outside this.<br><br>The difficulty I think for the current kidult generation is that they are a bit lost between being treated like children and developing a sense of their own independence. This is currently socially acceptable but given history, has not been so in the past. They are in effect a group in transition and may not make a move until such time as they are married, their parents die etc. It's not a good outcome for them and they are not being equipped with the skills they need to navigate their way in society, otherwise they'd be doing it.<br><br>Who knows how they would be able to deal with a world in which they have to fend and feed for themselves? Probably not well.<br><br>The kidult would probably not be a sustainable arrangement in a resource constrained environment.<br><br>Good luck.<br><br><a href=#c1645011464991647963 title="comment permalink">4/10/10, 2:15 AM</a><br><br>

It's a genuine feeling of discontent driven by real problems in the society. There is less to go around now that we've passed peak oil and people are discovering that the society does not work the way the happy myths said it did - and they have little power to effect change (i.e. get more of the pie) from within the system. The system blocks that because it was designed to protect wealth and power from change.<br><br>The Tea Party organization itself is how that source of social power is manipulated. It's not spontaneous, it was created by some very wealthy people to advance their own agenda. That's made possible because the participants lack a knowledge of history and are still expecting the system to serve their interests as they were taught that it did. <br><br>Howerd Zinn's "A people's history of the United States: 1492-present" is a good perspective. It was written from a particular point of view, but he is very open about that. Even if you read it only as a listing of events you'll get an understanding of the continual conflict of our history. We've been here before, it's just that the incredible abundance of the age of oil allowed more people a bigger share of the spoils, which in turn created more stability. Now that's done, people are losing what what they had and they're angry. Ambitious people will try to capitalize on that anger, and the ones that they fool into helping them are unlikely to benefit much.<br><br><a href=#c9160357597385873411 title="comment permalink">4/10/10, 7:02 AM</a><br><br>

There is potential for connections and family trades passed down that are beyond the reach of those who are kicked out or who just choose to leave early. If they are lucky then will have support and love and security which is truly a great thing for anyone. There is something to be said for being thrown out and to fly or die, but decadence is hardly the only reason for families staying together. <br><br>I live in Hong Kong, but I'm from Oz, in fact I'm back at the moment, but I have been asked on a number of occasions why westerners tend to leave home so early while Cantonese people tend to stay at home longer. I thought about it and saw it as a kind of rite of passage for us and a way for us to learn to look after ourselves. But their history and culture still retains a focus on family piety, which for us has become gradually less important. Theirs comes from Confucianism but both of ours stems from a history of interdependence necessary for survival in close knit communities. <br><br>Of course there is the potential for restricted development, particularly when the kids have to follow only their parents lead rather forging their own path and incubating their own sense of self, braced by critical thinking and decision making. But it is not intrinsically flawed. <br><br>In fact it seems like a case of the grass is always greener...There has been a lot of romantic searching within Australian society for the close knit family ties of other cultures, while it seems many other people from other societies would love the opportunity to be freed from the shackles of a life dictated to them by the needs and customs of their family. <br><br>I understand what you're saying about people not being able to survive without someone else thinking for them but I don't think it's quite right to put it all on family structure. If i got kicked out of home at 15 and had to live on the streets and had no love and never learned to develop emotionally past fight and flight then I could too end up a very dependent individual.<br><br>Having said all that, I would also like to say that I often appreciate your comments as they are grounded in your experience rather speculation.

They are not trained for draft use, but they aren't industrial Holsteins, either. The big issue, as with horses, is training the animal to work in harness.<br><br>The steers part is because the hormone driven bull is unpredictable and strong. The steer is nearly as strong, and not prone to the aggression of the bull. As with all livestock, animals that aren't controllable make good stew meat.<br><br>Typical lifespan for cows in cow-calf herds run 8 to 12 years. A steer might work in harness (you call him an ox when he gets to age four) from age four to 10 or 10. Today we often slaughter for market between 6 months and 2 years - so even planning on using steers allows for a lot of growth in cow/oxen populations. The choke point will be finding people to train the oxen (it starts at 3-4 months for the calf), and finding people that know how to farm, and also to work that farm using oxen, horses, tractors, or the wife and kids - or some combination. In the past, farm families were *large*, since the more hands working, the more chance of a harvest that increases assets.<br><br>Bloat is only one of many issues facing the farmer and livestock husbandman. Balancing nutrition needs, keeping water in clean condition and in sufficient quantity, managing pests from fungus, mold, and rodents to coyotes, wolves, and thievery, these will keep a farmer busy.<br><br><br>@xhmko,<br><br>I thought my Junior High social studies book said that rubber came from the tropics. I presume the transport cost from the tropics to Oklahoma will get more expensive, making rubber more expensive.<br><br>Today I believe tires are made on a body woven of nylon, with high tensile strength strands of steel woven under the face of the tire. During WWII, I think tires were made of cotton. If we could get the rubber trees to grow in America - or we make deals or merely conquer Central America - possibly a return to cotton based tires will keep the "rubber on the road". The vulcanizing - baking the petroleum-based carbon particles in the latex to prolong the life of the rubber - I believe replace the earlier technique of smoking the rubber over a smoky fire, somewhat similar to embedding carbon in the fibers of leather when "curing" it.

"<br><br>I can see a couple of reasons for kicking the kids out. One is lack of resources in the area to support multiple adults. This could be a natural lack of produce, or a punitive government. Another motivator could be the modern nonsense of the "single family dwelling" being a symbol of "manhood".<br><br>I think it is the occupation, not the dwelling, that should be the focus. Children can learn enough to do measurable work on a small, mixed crop and livestock farm, from age five or six. In a housing development, there may never be a useful way to use the kids - or to provide them with meaningful labor to allow their character, diligence, patience, and endurance to develop. For the Amish, this is a matter of faith, that the farm is a good place to raise children.<br><br>The prevailing notion of rote labor being the antithesis of affluence - i.e., the "modern" lifestyle - that is going to be a tough world view to challenge.<br><br>Personally I think a couple should expect to live with her parents or his, at least until their firstborn is school age. In the US as recently as 100 years ago, and in many parts of the world today, children weren't completely weaned until age four or five. They make fun of this in Kevin James' upcoming movie, "Grown Ups" (due in June) - with a kid nursing at age four.

That used to work here, but not any more. You have to take everything for a newer car into a dealer and pay much much more.<br><br>Now I am not arguing for cars but just using this as one example. You can hammer dents out of metal, but not out of plastic. The resilience and repairability of wood, metal, stone is opposed to the need to replace plastics in entirety (not to mention the problems in peak oil since plastics are petroleum based and require even more petroleum for recycling).<br><br>You could keep old radios and TVs going a lot longer when they ran on tubes.

Haha... it's a sad but VERY true statement. It's akin to the industrial mindset that if you've got cancer then why don't you pay someone to inject radiation into your blood stream.<br><br>I also wanted to make a comment on modern economic thinking in terms of food production. The current mainstream belief is that our agricultural systems are the most efficient and productive they have ever been. Scientists splice genes, factories create ammonium nitrate and glyphosate, then a john deere rips open the earth, shooting a seed into it, comes back in 4 weeks to spray some glyphosate, then returning in 16 more weeks to pull all the seed off the heads with a diesel guzzling robot. "200 bushels an acre of corn!" they'll exclaim, but never will you hear a farmer (I mean robot assistant... or is it slave?) or economist mention how many gallons of diesel, tonnes of topsoil, or billions of organisms vanished in its wake.<br><br>On the other hand, we have the direction our food systems must go in if we want to make it, and that looks a lot like a forest -- perennial polycultures of multi-purpose plants. The defining characteristic of farming in the 21st century will be in carbon sequestering systems that are powered, propagated and planted by the sun (humans). Even sustainable farming won't cut it, our food systems must create more fertility and calories than they take to be grown -- food growing must be regenerative. Annual agriculture in terms of energy input is not sustainable nor efficient -- at least not anything beyond garden scale. So, I see a lot of jobs being created for herders, berry pickers, coppicers, and nut harvesters in the next century...<br><br>Have you heard of the book Edible Forest Gardens by Dave Jacke by chance?

(and everyone ignoring the cost of the inputs) reminded me of something I saw in 4-H of all places.<br><br>The objective is to grow your lamb (or calf) as big and as quickly as you can, to get it to market fast. So, people buy grain and other fancy mixed feeds, and feed up their baby animal so it will grow quickly. There are prizes for the fastest rate of gain and the biggest, heaviest animal generally sells for the highest price.<br><br>The first year we were involved, we did that kind of thing - we weren't really trying to win, we were just learning, but you know, everyone feeds lambs creep feed, so we bought creep feed. You need to, right?<br><br>However, part of 4-H is to do recordkeeping. So, at the end of the year we looked at the input costs and the price per pound of the finished animal. Surprise, we were losing money. The usual strategy then is to buy better feed, or get more grain going in. We chose to go the other route - instead of increasing our inputs to increase our outputs, we decreased our inputs to decrease our costs. We have more control over the costs than the retail price, and if we're okay with the growing out time taking a bit longer ... well ... it's working for us.<br><br>You do have to be willing to wait, which most people aren't, and go go against the 'trends' (which if you are selling at auction is guaranteed to be a problem - we ignore the auction &amp; sell direct). The end product is just as good (if not better), but you can't convince 'real farmers' of this, for the most part.

However, in times of scarcity everyone had to pull their weight. In times of abundance though there was allowance for plenty of indulgence. In fact the early Aboriginals used to laugh at the amount of work that the Europeans did even though there was plenty of resources around. I'm often reminded of the feted explorers Burke and Wills who died of both arrogance and stupidity and whilst ignoring assistance from the Aboriginal population. The other side of the coin so to speak is that with hunter gatherer societies, if you were female and of breeding age, you were probably traded off into another tribal unit and if you were male and in excess of the tribal requirements you were sent off to war on another tribe. Not one for the romantics and it's a bit different from working on the family farm!<br><br>The other problem with family farm's and it is rarely spoken about is succession planning. Which children continue the farm upon the death of the parents. What if there is a dispute between competing children? What is there is a perception that one child has more skill in this area than the others? What if one of the children is just hopless? Again without the village these people have no where to go to. If you look at the practicalities family farms are not that romantic either.<br><br>The family unit is not an end in itself, it is the begining, and of itself it is not sustainable in an age of declining resources.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><a href=#c818595082607607519 title="comment permalink">4/12/10, 3:29 PM</a><br><br>

Thanks for your thoughtful reply. The core of my previous post was that the family structure is not the appropriate structure with which to survive in a declining age of resources. The simple reason for this is that families tolerate behaviour in individuals that society in general will not tolerate. In addition to this families will also allow some family members to passenger along and not pull their weight. This is increasingly evident in our current society (both East and West) where there is access to resources in excess of what you'd expect to find in either an agrarian or hunter gatherer society as parents utilise this excess for the indulgence of their offspring. In China you can see the rise of the problems with children being treated as "little emperors" which is a direct result of the previous observation.<br><br>I have travelled widely through Asia and have a deep respect for their culture and peoples. China is also certainly on the ascendancy as the US empire declines. It is however worth noting a weakness in that most company structures in Asia are based around family units, even very large companies. The problem with this is reflected in the Chinese saying that wealth rarely survives three generations. I've always interpreted this as meaning (and I may be wrong, please correct me if this is the case) that the first generation generates the wealth, the second spends it and the third laments it's passing. I've worked for wealthy people and this seems to be the case here as well. The family unit doesn't provide a broad enough range of experiences and knowledge to be able to survive as a single entity, which is why I advocate for people to leave the family nest upon completion of their formal education. The family unit will be simply part of a survival mechanism, but it is not sustainable in itself.<br><br>In ecology it is remarked that you require a population of at least 500 individuals in order to maintain a sustainable population. These cannot all come from the same family as you require a bit of genetic diversity to avoid congenital diseases.<br><br>I keep coming back to the idea that as an agrarian (hunter gatherers are a different case) society you have to operate as part of a village in order to be sustainable whilst also retaining a useful range of goods and services. These societies differ from ours in that they self correct individuals poor behaviour and because you need to eat, everyone has to pull their weight. It's never ceases to amaze me that in a small community everyone knows and discusses everyone's business. Yet this tendancy has it useful purposes.<br><br>Hope this clarifies my earlier post.<br>PS: I'm at Cherokee in Victoria.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><a href=#c1825849483788356525 title="comment permalink">4/12/10, 3:29 PM</a><br><br>

Our skeletal records, while admittedly patchy, show men living to 40-something and women to 20-something. The men's skeletons have the sort of injuries you see in rodeo clowns, the sort that come from sharing close quarters with large frightened animals. The women's skeletons mainly suggest malnutrition; this might have been one of those cultures where the mighty hunters eat first to keep up their strength, and the women survive on what's left.<br><br>Cathy: a hectograph is not that hard to make if you've got gelatine and something that can serve as ink, and was actually quite popular for samizdat-type publications. You can get fifty copies off one blank if you do it exactly right.<br><br>Cherokee Organics: Actually, the historical norm in most cultures has been to live with your parents all your life, until they died and you inherited their house. The only 'moving out' that happened was brides moving in with their husband's parents, or vice-versa. If you delayed marriage until you could afford to buy real estate you'd die single, and if you went away and left your parents behind they'd starve once they were too old to work. If you live at home, everyone pools their money, Grandma or maiden Auntie are around to babysit the kids, nobody dies alone, and the property stays in the family. Most of Asia still finds this a functional system.<br><br><a href=#c5194929010061453381 title="comment permalink">4/12/10, 8:56 PM</a><br><br>

This is a historically recent occurrence and is only possible due to the squandering of scarce resources on peoples offspring. You overlook the fact that in these historical arrangements children are often seen as work units, retirement funds/support, are often married off early. In the west we have romantic notions of family life in other cultures, but the reality rarely lives up to these notions. <br><br>The arrangement that you refer to is born of the necessity of both having children and scarce resources at the same time. It is a predicament. The problem occurs when the children do not uphold (or are not held to account for) their part of the domestic arrangement. Also, it is not quite as simple to divide up the resources of a deceased parent/s among competing interests as you suggest. I referred to the difficulties of this situation in relation to family farms (in an earlier posting) and the difficulty they have in relation to succession planning. There is little or no difference between a family farm and a family house in this regard.<br><br>An additional point of differentiation is that for a generation at least it appears that life holds alternatives that their parents never may have had and it is generally treated by the individuals involved as an expected part of their life. Think all sorts of things such as higher education, friends that you have to travel by vehicle to see, travel, freely available contraception, movement to employment in distant locations (this occurs even in poorer countries too), vehicle useage, domestic heating and cooling, food availability and quantity etc. All of these expectations fuel a sense of entitlement and a resentment when they are not met. What we are witnessing currently is the unravelling of those expectations.<br><br>It's not for just any reason that peoples expectations have risen to unsustainable levels. It is a result of the useage of non renewable resources at a rate that is non sustainable. <br><br>I'm simply suggesting that it would be preferable if those individuals/generation were cast onto their own resources as it would accelerate their growth and resilience. Perhaps they may even push for change? It's not an easy path, but is it that much different from the path that we all must eventually take as resources become increasingly scarce? I suspect that we are all in for a rough ride.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><a href=#c8094499863000484026 title="comment permalink">4/13/10, 2:30 AM</a><br><br>

"<br><br>I don't ignore this in the slightest, in fact it was the point I was trying to make. Properly viewed, dependent but able-bodied adult offspring are potential resources rather than luxuries, though I grant your point that we mostly waste this resource just as we waste others. But this 'unromantic' perspective is exactly why I think more multigenerational families are likely to arise; I think being cared for by their children, however reluctantly, is the only viable prospect for our elderly once social insurance goes. <br><br>Bill,<br>To quote you, "Has there been a time where the life expectancy of men was actually longer than that of women?" That was the only question I was answering - yes, actually there has been. And you never specified that it be a /historic/ time. But I am being pedantic.<br><br>Having started in that vein, however, I may as well continue. In order: a) While it's true that my examples are several millenia old, that era makes up a far larger proportion of the human past than 'history' has done so far, so it's not fair to dismiss it as a marginal abberation. But after slogging through a degree and a half on this subject, I can't fault your observation that archaeological evidence can support widely varying interpretations. B) Nowhere did I so much as hint that I think the Neolithic will ever return. In fact I think this is the least likely outcome, ranking it even lower than complete extinction. A forager culture normally requires either a rich environment, or a large territory with very low population density, and our problem is just the opposite. C) Regarding meat distribution, I was drawing an analogy to historic-era cultures that worked this way. This system is arguably justifiable on libertarian grounds - compensation is precisely defined in proportion to how much each individual contributed. However, if you want an alternative hypothesis, multiple closely-spaced pregnancies deplete the body's reserves with no recovery period, and forager women often have frequent miscarriages in addition due to their lifestyle. That might account for the depleted state of young female skeletons.<br><br>Bringing this tangent closer to home: a few posts mention that contraception is likely to become less available. While contraception per se is not dependent on industry - sausage makers have the necessary raw materials for condoms, which in the original model were reusable, and the Romans had a moderately effective oral contraceptive - anything where a steady supply is important is especially problematic. However, anthropology provides plenty of examples of 'family planning' customs of a non-medical nature. Some are obviously not suitable for our context, but with North American culture experimenting with varied forms of partnering and childrearing, some might have a chance of catching on. Lengthy breastfeeding, for example, has preconditions and pitfalls, but it's a popular strategy in hungry times for other reasons, and is not a huge modification of our existing practices.

I'm wondering if we aren't getting just a touch of Renaissance Faire Syndrome here: future history isn't going to be a film run in reverse. <br><br>To add a bit of counterpoint to the discussion, Rosie was the product of more than a half century of fossil-fuelled mechanized agriculture, and a lot less self sufficient than shown. And I would guess there'd be resistance to grinding her up and feeding her to the other Riveters when it's time to downsize. And of course HAL was from an era when a computer had its own wing of a building, with a raised floor, air handler, chilled water supply and power mains.
