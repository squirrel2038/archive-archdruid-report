It has been an interesting week for connoisseurs of decline and fall. As I’m sure all my readers are aware by now, a small volcano in Iceland managed to chuck a sizable monkey wrench into the gears of business as usual across Europe by filling the upper atmosphere with a massive plume of what amounts to finely ground glass: just the thing you want to put into the intake of your favorite jet engine.<br><br>Most volcanic eruptions don’t do this, but Eyjafjallajokull – say that three times very fast – happens to be under a glacier. (It <i>is</i> located in a country called Iceland, after all.) Or, rather, it used to be under a glacier; bring molten lava into contact with a glacier and you don’t have a glacier for long. What you have instead is what volcanologists call a phreatic eruption and the rest of us call a steam explosion. Rinse (with lava) and repeat, and you get two things. The first is a stratosphere full of fine sandpaper grit; the second is most of a continent flailing helplessly as one of its transportation networks shuts down for several days.<br><br>The human reaction was instructive. One of my regular readers commented that his wife, who works in the travel industry, has been deluged by calls from irate travelers who seem convinced that she can make the ash go away with a couple of phone calls. An EU commissioner was caught in public saying that long distance tourism was an inalienable human right, while airlines demanded that governments compensate them for the closure of the skies; at least they had the grace not to demand the money from Iceland. Meanwhile Great Britain, which gets most of its fruit and much of its vegetables from the Third World by air, was facing the prospect of bare shelves in the grocery stores for the first time since the aftermath of the Second World War.<br><br>It’s been a while since we’ve had so clear a reminder that the intricate and fragile clockwork of industrial society depends so completely on Nature’s whims, but as usual, most people managed not to get the memo. Me, I didn’t give it much thought, since I was reading a different and more familiar memo, the one brought every spring by lengthening days and the waning risk of frost. I was out in the garden planting bush beans, dwarf peas, and Danvers carrots, since the weather was warm and the Moon was in a fertile sign.<br><br>Yes, I plant by the signs. I originally learned that habit out in the Pacific Northwest, where very few people do it, and it’s ironic that I ended up moving to the Appalachians, where most gardeners keep an eye on the almanac when choosing planting dates. Do I think it works? A lot depends on what’s meant by that rather facile question. It certainly doesn’t do any harm; my gardens get good results at least as reliably as those of my neighbors, and it’s no particular inconvenience to check the signs when deciding when to plant the next round of seeds. I don’t know for a fact that it helps, but then the same thing could be said for many other things I do in the garden. (I’m more interesting in growing vegetables than in proving a point, so I don’t deprive part of my garden of compost, say, to find out whether putting my kitchen wastes in the compost bin rather than a landfill makes as much difference as it seems.) Besides, planting by the signs has entertainment value: I’ve come to enjoy the theatrics the habit attracts from rationalists who get incensed by anything they consider superstitious.<br><br>Of course they’re quite correct that planting by the signs is a superstition, but that word has a subtler meaning than most people remember these days. A superstition is literally something “standing over” (in Latin, <i>super stitio</i>) from a previous age; more precisely, it’s an observance that has become detached from its meaning over time. A great many of today’s superstitions thus descend from the religious observances of archaic faiths. When my wife’s Welsh grandmother set a dish of milk outside the back door for luck, for example, she likely had no idea that her pagan ancestors did the same thing as an offering to the local tutelary spirits.<br><br>Yet there’s often a remarkable substrate of ecological common sense interwoven with such rites. If your livelihood depends on the fields around your hut, for example, and rodents are among the major threats you face, a ritual that will attract cats and other small predators to the vicinity of your back door night after night is not exactly foolish. The Japanese country folk who consider foxes the messengers of Inari the rice god, and put out offerings of fried tofu to attract them, are mixing agricultural ecology with folk religion in exactly the same way.<br><br>There’s a lot of this sort of thing in the world of superstition. I have long since lost the reference, but many years ago I read an ecological study of human hunting practices, which pointed out that nearly all cultures that get much of their food from the hunt use divination to decide where to hunt on any given day. The authors pointed out that according to game theory, the best strategy in any competition has to include a random element in order to keep the other side guessing. Most prey animals are quite clever enough to figure out a nonrandom pattern of hunting – there’s a reason why deer across America head into suburbs and towns, where hunting isn’t allowed, as soon as hunting season opens each year – so inserting a random factor into hunting strategy will pay off in increased kills over time. As far as we know, humans are the only animals that make decisions with the aid of horoscopes, tarot cards, yarrow stalks and the like, and it’s intriguing to think that this habit may have had a significant role in our evolutionary success.<br><br>Is this all there is to the practice of superstition? It’s a good question, and one that’s effectively impossible to answer. For all I know, all those ancient civilizations that built vast piles of stone to the honor of their gods may have been right to say that Marduk, Osiris, Kukulcan et al. were well pleased by having big temples erected in their honor, and reciprocated by granting peace and prosperity to their worshippers. It may just be a coincidence that channeling the boisterous energy of young men into some channel more constructive than civil war is a significant social problem in most civilizations, and giving them big blocks of stone to haul around in teams, in hot competition with other teams, seems to do the trick; it may also be a coincidence that convincing the very rich to spend their wealth employing huge numbers of laborers on vanity buildings provides a steady boost to even the simplest urban economy. Maybe this is how Kukulcan shows that he’s well pleased.<br><br>Still, there’s a wild card in the deck, because it’s possible for even the most useful superstition to become a major source of problems when conditions change. When the Mayan civilization overshot the carrying capacity of its fragile environment, the Mayan elite responded to the rising spiral of crisis by building more and bigger temples. That had worked in the past, but it failed to work this time, because the situation was different; the problem had stopped being one of managing social stresses within Mayan society, and turned into one of managing the collapsing relationship between Mayan society and the natural systems that supported it. This turned what had been an adaptive strategy into a disastrously maladaptive one, as resources and labor that might have been put to use in the struggle to maintain a failing agricultural system went instead to a final spasm of massive construction projects. This time, Kukulcan was not pleased, and Mayan civilization came apart in a rolling collapse that turned a proud civilization into crumbling ruins.<br><br>Rationalists might suggest that this is what happens to a civilization that tries to manage its economic affairs by means of superstitions. That may be so, but the habit in question didn’t die out with the classic Mayan civilization; it’s alive and well today, with a slight difference. Ancient cultures built huge pyramids of stone; we build even vaster pyramids of money.<br><br>In <i>Cardano’s Cosmos</i>, a thoughtful study of the life and times of the great Renaissance astrologer Girolamo Cardano, historian Anthony Grafton tried to explain the role of astrologers as advisers to Renaissance governments by comparing them to economists in today’s world. Plausible as this comparison may seem at first glance, I have to say that it is deeply unfair to astrologers. Whether or not astrology works as advertised – a question I don’t propose to address here – no competent astrologer claims that the Sun will rise in the west or that Jupiter will swing between the Earth and the Moon. By contrast, it’s not hard to find economists blithely insisting, as many did during the recent housing bubble, that a speculative frenzy can keep on inflating forever, or claiming, as many are doing right now, that a nation can make itself prosperous by running up mountains of debt.<br><br>Economics is our modern superstition – well, one of them, at any rate, and one of the most popular among the political class of today’s industrial societies. Like any other superstition, it has a core of pragmatic wisdom to it, but that core has been overlaid with a great deal of somewhat questionable logic. My wife’s Welsh ancestors believed that the bowl of milk on the back stoop pleased the fairies, and that’s why the rats stayed away from the kitchen garden; the economists of the twentieth century believed that expanding the money supply pleased – well, the prosperity fairies, or something not too dissimilar – and that’s why depressions stayed away from the United States.<br><br>In both cases it’s arguable that something very different was going on. The gargantuan economic boom that made America the world’s largest economy had plenty of causes; the accident of political geography that kept its industrial hinterlands from becoming war zones, while most other industrial nations got the stuffing pounded out of them, had more than a little to do with the matter; but the crucial point, one too often neglected in studies of twentieth century history, was the simple fact that the United States at midcentury produced more petroleum than all the other countries on Earth put together. The oceans of black gold on which the US floated to victory in two world wars defined the economic reality of an epoch. As a result, most of what passed for economic policy in the last sixty years or so amounted to attempts to figure out how to make use of unparalleled abundance.<br><br>That’s still what today’s economists are trying to do, using pretty much the same habits they adopted during the zenith of the age of oil. The problem is that this is no longer what economists need to be doing. With the coming of peak oil and the first slow slippages in worldwide conventional petroleum production, the challenge facing today’s industrial societies is managing the end of abundance. The age of cheap abundant energy now ending was a dramatic anomaly in historical terms, though not quite unprecedented; every so often, but rarely, it happens that a human society finds itself free from natural limits to prosperity and expansion – for a time. That time always ends, and the society has to relearn the lessons of more normal and less genial times. This is what we need to do now.<br><br>This is exactly what today’s economics is unprepared to do, however. Like the Mayan elite at the beginning of what archeologists call the Terminal Classic period, our political classes are trying to meet unfamiliar problems with overfamiliar solutions. The results have not been good. Repeated attempts to overcome economic stagnation by expanding access to credit have produced a series of destructive speculative bubbles and crashes, and efforts to maintain an inflated standard of living in the face of a slowly contracting real economy have heaped up gargantuan debts. These measures haven’t worked; the one significant attempt to do something different, the neoconservative project to invade Iraq and put its oil reserves in American hands, was even less successful; and at this point fingerpointing and frantic pedaling in place seems to have replaced any more constructive response to a situation that is becoming more dangerous by the day.<br><br>Are there constructive things that could be done? Of course, but every one of them flies in the face of the currently accepted economic superstitions, and most of them also involve requiring the people who benefit disproportionately from the current state of things to give up some of their perquisites – not exactly a winning bet at a time when political power has become so diffuse in most industrial nations that some pressure group or other can be counted on to veto any attempt at systemic change. I’ve already suggested several possible steps in this blog – replacing income and sales taxes with resource and interest taxes; making corporations subject to nonfinancial penalties for criminal acts; reinventing urban and suburban agriculture; tilting tax policy to encourage single-income families; rebuilding the household economy, and more – but I’ve done so in the full awareness that none of these things are going to be discussed in the corridors of government any time soon. Those that will happen at all, will happen because they can be set in motion by individuals, families, and local communities; those that can’t be pursued on that level – well, let’s just say I’m not holding my breath.<br><br>The act of faith that leads policy makers today to think that policies that failed last year will succeed next year is only part of the problem, of course. The superstitions that lead so many intelligent people to think that our problems can be solved by pursuing a flotilla of new and expensive technological projects are another part. There are technologies that can help us right now, granted, but they’re on the other end of the spectrum from the fusion reactors and solar satellites and plans to turn all of Nevada into one big algae farm that get so much attention today. Local, resilient, sustainable, and cheap: those should be our keywords just now; there are plenty of technological solutions that answer to that description, but again, our superstitions stand in the way.<br><br>The widespread reaction to the Eyjafjallajokull eruption, for that matter, points up what may just be the most deeply rooted of our superstitions, the belief that Nature can be ignored with impunity. It’s only fair to point out that for most people in the industrial world, for most of a century now, this has been true more often than not; the same exuberant abundance that produced ski slopes in Dubai and fresh strawberries in British supermarkets in January made it reasonable, for a while, to act as though whatever Nature tossed our way could be brushed aside. In the emerging postabundance age, though, this may be the most dangerous superstition of all. The tide of cheap abundant energy that has defined our attitudes as much as our technologies is ebbing now, and we are rapidly losing the margin of error that made our former arrogance possible.<br><br>As that change unfolds, it might be worth suggesting that it’s time to discard our current superstitions concerning economics, energy, and nature, and replace them with some more functional approach to these things. A superstition, once again, is an observance that has become detached from its meaning, and one of the more drastic ways this detachment can take place is a change in the circumstances that make that meaning relevant. This has arguably happened to our economic convictions, and to a great many more of the commonplaces of modern thought; and it’s simply our bad luck, so to speak, that the consequences of pursuing those superstitions in the emerging world of scarcity and contraction are likely to be considerably more destructive than those of planting by the signs or leaving a dish of milk on the back step.

Pretty much none of the varieties of anything that did well in Colorado are worth a fig here in Tennessee; Ashland versus Cumberland is probably similar in that regard. A pointer I picked up from a local old-timer has been very useful: Plant your tomatoes when the black walnuts bloom. This really does seem to work, and factors in year-to-year variability as well as microclimates. It only works, of course, if your flagship walnut is in the same microclimate as your tomato patch. Around here a walnut in the bottom of a hollow blooms about 1-2 weeks later than one on a ridge, which is just about the same as the difference in average freeze dates. Since I started using this rule I've had no significant freeze disasters (at least with the tomatoes). Right now the catkins are lengthening on our indicator walnut, but the blooms aren't yet open and adding their pollen to the rich mix we are already inhaling, so my tomatoes and peppers remain safe inside in spite of balmy weather. So is this an empirically determined phenological correlation, or is it an old folk superstition? Depends on whom you ask, I guess.<br><br>Folks around here will also tell you that water makes it cold. If you're near a pond or a creek, you'll be colder at night. Technically, they are wrong. It isn't the water that makes the low spots colder, it's the cold air drainage. But, since the thin layer of cold air on a calm clear night, and the water that feeds the creeks and ponds both flow downhill and accumulate in the hollows, they do both tend to wind up in the same places. So you might say it's a superstition that the water makes it cold (actually, building a pond will make your holler a teeny bit warmer at night, not colder), but it's still a good guideline to use when evaluating where the frost pockets are likely to be. We live between two creeks and surrounded by ponds, and on a calm clear night we are just about the coldest spot in middle Tennessee (I have the numbers to prove it!).<br><br>As for economic superstitions, JMG got the nail on the head. I already posted a small rant about the media pundit reaction to the Icelandic volcano on my own blog.<br><br><a href=#c721292784098319019 title="comment permalink">4/21/10, 9:50 PM</a><br><br>

I gave up mentioning that one a decade or two back. Too many funny looks<br><br>“power has become so diffuse in most industrial nations that some pressure group or other can be counted on to veto any attempt at systemic change”<br><br>I guess many of us realise that the implications of that with regards the political vector of change that will likely arise arent all that pretty to consider. Should we try to push the inevitable off in the hope that “something” better will appear in the interim, or do we start right now in the hope that after the dust settles there will still be some resources left to work with. Purely rhetorical question since none of us get to decide those events, but maybe interesting to discuss.<br><br>the Eyjafjallajokull eruption and superstitions<br>People have been posting on yahoo (12000 comments so far) some of their personal thoughts regarding the event (and the other posters). It is informative in an entertaining way in regards to the sophistication of the “modern” human mind and how superstitions old and new, well disconnected from the reality they attempted to model, still have life. I wont copy any of those but here are 4 succinct responses to original posts. I think I would like these people if I met them.<br><br>Headline “Iceland evacuates hundreds as volcano erupts again”<br><br>“Please everyone, just relax. Sometimes planets just EXPLODE. This isnt anything you can do about it, so just open a brewski, have a nice snack and wait for the Big Bang.<br>Dont cry either, it wont help.”<br><br>“Your village called. They want you to come home. They miss their idiot.”<br><br>“Your teeth have become infiltrated with commies and they have formed a conspiracy to take over your body.

It is remarkably accurate at predicting the weather, planting seasons and determining more arcane things, such as the correct timing for weddings and Vedic esoteric temple rituals. With a little research, one can also find Vedic <em>ślokas</em> that describe methods for <a href=http://www.vedicsociety.org/an-introduction-to-vedic-farming-methods-p-185.html rel=nofollow>invigorating seed and the soil</a> that work very well. The neem tree alone provides so many natural remedies, for everything from acne to malaria and diabetes. The ancient Vedic ways are still very much in use here, especially in smaller villages, and appropriate technology is as close as your nearest autonomous mobile organic recycling center, sometimes known as a cow. There is a fully redundant natural backup system for everything here; the electricity could go off permanently tomorrow, and while there might be some temporary inconvenience, most people's lives would not be in danger. Don't try this at home, kids—at least in the West. The deeper we settle into the ancient rhythm of life here, the more we are amazed at the power of the ancient cultural wisdom still kept alive in the hearts of the villagers, especially the older ones. We will be learning here for a long, long time.<br><br><a href=#c8960016510767216635 title="comment permalink">4/22/10, 12:24 AM</a><br><br>

Timing is everything.<br><br>Walk out into your garden at a busy time of year, and all the many tasks are clamoring for your attention; do I turn the compost or thin the carrots, or...(add 6-10more items). If the moon's in a fertile sign, it's the latter, a fire sign, the former. Of course, this is a simplification, but my point is that the moon is as much MY time organizer/prioritizer, as it is an influence on all the other water-bodies in the world.<br><br>Among the more insane superstitions of our industrial malaise is our framing of time itself.

Mark it with a big red sharpie in your "day runner" - our institutionalized calendar is scheduled for extinction. <br><br>In other words, we've got to start living on plant-time; the collapse won't happen within months, years, or centuries; it'll happen during a growing season.

Likely the study in question is that by O.K. Moore, "Divination: a new perspective", published in the American Anthropologist back in 1957. Called "scapulimancy", the divination technique involves heating the shoulder blade (scapula) of an animal or the breast bone of a bird, then interpreting the resulting cracks and char marks.<br>One objection to the view that scapulimancy serves to randomize hunting decisions is raised by Adrian Tanner in his monograph "Bringing Home Animals." Tanner notes that divination is generally not undertaken at a time when Cree hunters do not know where to go hunting.<br>Academic niceties aside, I very much look forward to reading your thoughts on the divine science of astrology, of which I became a practitioner following years of cultivation in the lofty groves of anthropology.<br><br><a href=#c5633692432971857732 title="comment permalink">4/22/10, 8:30 AM</a><br><br>

Yes, the pursuit has been a good-faith attempt to describe human behavior that is deep-down based on observations, but it's also frequently been self-serving justification, and I have a constant distrust of the precision that it claims for itself. A gripe I have about modern economics is that as a model of human behavior, it produces some major shortcomings when it comes to describing actual decision-making, and how authorities operate.<br><br>But (you knew this was coming, right?), I think it's important to note that we're describing a few <i>schools</i> of economic thought advising the current political landscape. Schools that have, as you say, basically been adapted to describe the ridiculous energy abundance we've enjoyed for 150 years. The general study of economics, however, is older than that. If you go back to the seventeenth and eighteenth century, then you'll find prominent ideas that are very much connected to agricultural production and sustainable population. Malthus and Mill didn't have the numerical finesse (or tools) of the eggheads and sharks on Wall Street, but that doesn't mean they weren't sharp. (Hopefully, there's a better scholar of Mill around.) More to the point, they were writing to describe the observations of their times. Malthus was done in by some technological innovations--he had inadequate numbers, but he had the right idea. Today's capitalists may find themselves outside the range of their base assumptions before very long as well. The study will adapt again, and still try to describe the world accurately like any good gang of rationalist. <br><br>The current batch sure does have a lot to answer for, for neglecting those older constraints.<br><br>It's interesting how economic theory has supported governing or dominant-class interests (like mercantilism, or the capitalism of today) or opposed them (like Marxism, or Enlightenment-vintage capitalism).

There isnt actually anything called global warming science.

If the priesthood can get you to do the “correct behaviour” whilst keeping you abstracted from the actual environmental trigger that prompts the behaviour, then that gives them power.

They discovered that magic relied on a natural resource called mana that was being rapidly depleted by such ostentatious displays as floating palaces and so on. So they determined to find and execute the last remaining god so they could harvest its mana and cast a spell to bring the moon to earth to serve as a new power source. Needless to say it didnt end well and the moon is still in the sky today....<br><br><a href=#c5971077379693200674 title="comment permalink">4/22/10, 3:54 PM</a><br><br>

That I know of, it's a two-digit number, and not a very large one at that. Most economists who said anything at all were cheerleading a speculative bubble that was doomed to blow up. If economics is to deserve the label of science, it needs to make accurate predictions of events in its field. Today's economics consistently fails to do so. When that changes, I'll reconsider my judgment. <br><br>Keifus, oh, granted -- there have been economists who don't deserve the blanket label I've suggested for them; John Kenneth Galbraith, who was too good a historian to fall for the quantitative delusions that pass for economic thought these days, is a favorite example of mine. Still, how much attention do they get in the discipline these days? <br><br>Houyhnhnm, no argument. If anything, the rise of virtual (un)reality has put that sort of disconnect into overdrive. <br><br>Blue Sun, no, a tradition can still be fully connected to its meaning; gardeners who wait to plant tomatoes until the black walnut blooms are following a tradition, but they generally know exactly why they're doing it -- to avoid the danger of late frosts.

I think you might find that this fragility derives from dependence on a few “primary nodes” and/or “essential services”.

Looking at both the past and present of history I'm struck by a certain pattern. <br><br>Centers of power arise around, essentially, the plunder of some non-renewable energy source - be it oil, coal, virgin forests, soil. <br><br>Those centers of power develop some cultural image around their success, e.g. a magnificent civilization such as Maya cities, the Roman Empire, or modern industrialized nations, that captivates the people and unites them under this project. <br><br>The human leaders that manage those powers are as deluded as anyone else by their cultural myths and cannot see how their prosperity is founded on the exploitation of the non-renewable resource. Once the resource goes into depletion and the power fades, the leaders are useless because they cannot think outside the box of their system.<br><br>The question that haunts me is just how much of human civilization has been based on plunder of some kind versus how much has been somewhat sustainable? <br><br>I suspect you might answer that Oriental civilizations achieved some degree of sustainability.<br><br>Looking at the Middle East and Europe, however, it seems like a long story of relentless resource depletion, with the dominant culture simply shifting gradually northwest into less depleted areas. First the soils and forests of the Fertile Crescent, then of the Mediterranean as a whole, then moving on to Northern Europe and Russia. Eventually it exploits coal and then petroleum to replace what could not be had directly off the land in the form of soil and wood.<br><br>My point is that it seems to me that industrial civilization is not fundamentally different from the past in its exploitation, just quantitatively different in the power of its energy source.<br><br>Without coal, oil, and vast expanses of old growth forests and fertile soils, what will civilizations of the deep future exploit? Will they perhaps not arise at all while there is no non-renewable to exploit?<br><br><a href=#c294814321607153497 title="comment permalink">4/23/10, 7:58 AM</a><br><br>

Raw milk has lactase, an enzyme that aids in the digestion of lactose, but pasteurization destroys the enzymes. Many lactose intolerant people who get sick from pasteurized milk can tolerate raw milk (for those who still can't fermenting it into yogurt, kefir etc breaks down most of the lactose and adds even more enzymes) Presumably the same is true for at least some animals, pasteurized milk will make them sick but not raw.<br><br><a href=#c2092833667289308403 title="comment permalink">4/23/10, 3:28 PM</a><br><br>

In South Western Australia the Nyungar people counted six seasons whose arrivals were heralded by changes in the environment around them, say the flowering of a tree or the migration of a bird. According to this interpretation of the seasons they were able to wander in a very structured way through their country and know when and where to hunt certain animals or collect the<br>eggs, fruits or vegetables that were available at that time in that area. <br><br>In the western desert region they counted three seasons. <br><br>When the British arrived with the four season model firmly implanted in their minds and culture, and their sedentry and agrarian lifestyles completely at odds with what most saw as impoverished random wanderers, very few of the benefits of these local customs were absorbed or understood. It is tragic really and yet the upside (at least in SW Australia) is that the knowledge is still available and able to be applied.

Galbraith had the temerity to point out a few of those "great lies", his fate was the same one that had already befallen those who had pointed them out from the beginning.

I’m sorry that I haven’t commented earlier, but I was busy with the four chicks I just bought, both making them comfortable in the makeshift brooder and in building the coop &amp; yard that I’ll transition them to! Ah, so many learning curves! <br><br>Two comments on your post:<br><i>It happens that a human society finds itself free from natural limits to prosperity and expansion – for a time. That time always ends, and the society has to relearn the lessons of more normal and less genial times. </i><br><br>I agree, but the parallel I see isn’t superstition, it’s developmental, though you (and commenters) pointed out the specifics of the developmental issue: if you keep a child from experiencing the limits of their abilities and/or the resources available, they will grow up expecting to have unlimited talents and resources! And that’s what we’ve done in the last couple generations, with the best of intentions, mostly. And now that people are starting to learn the hard limits, some are adapting, and some are having temper tantrums (just as all children aren’t alike in their rate of learning) . <br><br><i>By contrast, it’s not hard to find economists blithely insisting, as many did during the recent housing bubble, that a speculative frenzy can keep on inflating forever, or claiming, as many are doing right now, that a nation can make itself prosperous by running up mountains of debt.</i><br><br>My only quibble with this is that economists aren’t a “group” any more than “teachers” are… the variations and perspective differences are massive! And the “mountains of debt” is a horrible idea in the long run, but the parallel I compare it to would be a farm that is having a bad year – it’s not good to be continually in debt, but it’s “penny wise and pound foolish” not to invest in something if it can help that year (ie: extra fertilizer or row covers if there is a weather crisis)… if by investing, you save that year’s crop. Similarly, spending money in a recession (on the right things… and that is another issue, I know) might keep some from going under who just need a bridge to the next step, which might very well include one-income householding or backyard “farmette”.

It is then likely that inflation will follow."<br>Draco TB replied:<br>Again, true. But still no wealth has been created no matter how much money has been borrowed.<br><br>I suggest that you're both right, and that you're both wrong. This is only sometimes true and then only apparently so, which points out the difficulty of the Quantitative approach.<br><br>@Draco TB: wealth may or may not be created. It depends on the uses to which the credit is put. Credit is not evil in and of itself, the evil is entirely in its quantity. Too little stifles enterprise, and too much leads to "malinvestment" such as, oh say Mortgage Backed Securities and the great tracts of empty McMansions and upscale condos they represent, for example.<br><br>The question is: should rates be set by the conditions in the economy itself (with all of its rough justice), or should that be the purview of some committee of “experts”?<br><br>@mattbg: Adam Smith said something like (quoting from memory): It may be taken as a maxim that when a great deal can be made by the use of money, a great deal will be paid for the use of money; but that when little can be made by the use of money, little will be paid for the use of money.<br><br>Do you see that Keynes turned this maxim on its head and has confused cause and effect? Interest rates don't "drive the economy", the economy drives interest rates. That the former often appears to be true is only because, in the main, the economy is operating within normative bounds, where the "curve" is linear. When the economy, in the aggregate, approaches debt saturation - as it does now -, then the curve is anything but linear. But worse still, Quants aside, there is no curve, that is to say, no coherent mathematical function that defines Human behavior across the entire range of their emotions and actions.<br><br>There could be, perhaps, a Greed function, and a Fear function, but then is there also a Satisfaction function, a Survival function, a Love function and a Hate function? It's a fool's chase, and one ultimately inspired, I humbly suggest, by the Power function: the desire to control the masses for one's own aggrandizement - a further result of the deadly and psychologically twisted Vanity function so ably lampooned by Ecclesiasticus (King David?) in that quaint yet vastly under-appreciated tome called “The Bible”.<br><br>"If only everyone would do just as I say, then what a lovely world it would be." That's Keynes to a "T", and the same goes for Marx. In spades.<br><br>But this debate has been had before: Cardinal vs Ordinal scales of value (or Utility, in econo-speak). The attempt to put numerical (cardinal) values on Human wants and needs is fundamental to any Quantitative approach to Economics. Again, Classical theory warned against such folly stating that such desires can only be ranked ordinally and that such ranking will change depending on circumstances. For this bit of evident good sense, they've been ignored, and even vilified in the bargain.<br><br>That Ludwig von Mises seems to have been convincingly painted (by whom?) as a Nazi sympathizer - even here on this blog from time to time - is a very great injustice, and a sad statement on the effectiveness of calumny and propaganda.<br><br><a href=#c6020004606864812232 title="comment permalink">4/24/10, 8:20 PM</a><br><br>

Sociology has moved on from the 19th century and economics hasn't.<br><br>This is patent nonsense. What are we discussing here but the desultory attempt of economists to not just emulate - that alone is admirable and acceptable - but rather to imitate the hard sciences? The standard textbook in universities since about 1948 by Paul Samuelson purports to model economic equilibrium on the physical equations of thermodynamic equilibrium. Surely one must wonder if one's own behavior is really as predictable as that of a molecule. (As an aside though, the concept of Entropy - shorn of any attempt at quantification - can be quite instructive in the Social/Historic sphere.)<br><br>But surely there are durable first principles in economics that are no more tendentious than Newton or Watt are in Physics. That is the path from which "modern" economics diverged, and the goal must be to find our way back to that path - because it represents sound observations on Human behavior in the economic sphere - not to "throw the baby out with the bathwater", or to "re-invent the wheel". That path, I believe was largely blazed by the Classical Liberals, and continued by the Austrians - though no-one has followed them since Keynes came on the scene with his vain promise to "turn stones into bread". Incomplete it may well be in light of the peculiar characteristics of resource depletion and energy in particular, Austrianism is, I think the point of departure for any future advancement.<br><br>In fact, the words of mises quoted from his great yet neglected Economic treatise "Human Action", have recently become somewhat famous and widely quoted on the web, and deserve to be taken seriously:<br><br>"There is no means of avoiding a final collapse of a boom brought about by credit expansion. The alternative is only whether the crisis should come sooner as a result of a voluntary abandonment of further credit expansion or later as a final and total catastrophe of the currency system involved."<br><br>Is this not the pretty pass where we now find ourselves? I believe it is, and the next stage is the hyperinflation or the "Crack-up Boom", where the faith - i.e. belief - in the stability of the currency collapses such that people will rush to convert their currency holdings into "real goods" whether they need them or not, because those goods - any goods - become a better "store of value" than the discredited monetary unit which, by contrast, loses value literally by the minute..<br><br>Of course, the ultimate "good" is gold itself. I’d advise you, despite specious questions about its “spendability”, to get some while you still can. Of course, gold - or any form of money - is just a command on goods and cannot command goods that don’t exist. Far better to have, or produce yourself, the goods you need most urgently - like food for example. Becoming your own producer of essential goods is probably the best way to go.<br><br>However, that the cult of personality that present-day Austrianism has become is least likely to blaze that path to the future, and has become embayed in a back-water of denial and false hope, is very unfortunate indeed. But that's another story.<br><br>Draco TB, when one has taken the wrong path, the first step back is the first step forward.<br><br><a href=#c7185844477858302084 title="comment permalink">4/24/10, 8:50 PM</a><br><br>

For that matter, the classical liberal economists were as much ideologists as dispassionate students of economic behavior; I've discussed, in an earlier post, the way Ricardo's meretricious arguments in favor of "free trade" have been used by two successive empires, British and American, to obfuscate the harsh reality of a tribute economy that concentrates wealth in the imperial nation to the detriment of everybody else.<br><br><a href=#c3076525003832252440 title="comment permalink">4/24/10, 10:03 PM</a><br><br>

Farms that require mining are mines themselves, with depletion their ultimate destiny."<br><br>You may find that phosphates are washed overland and through the water table into the creeks, rivers and eventually the ocean. They are actually a pollutant as they encourage too much plant, algal and bacterial growth in those systems killing the natural flora and fauna. Not good. <br><br>The other main loss of phosphates is in the plant itself which is not generally returned to the soil in the area that it is grown. The reason for this is because of large scale sewage treatment processes and the habit of sending food scraps to landfill involved in Western industrial cultures actually creates a broken nutrient recycling system. It doesn't need to be this way.<br><br>Peak phosphates will most certainly be a major wakeup call for Industrial societies. Take for example the large scale corn farming which occurs in the US. Corn itself is a very heavy feeding plant and without the addition of super phosphates to the growth cycle of that plant, there will be over a few short cycles diminishing returns in output per acre. Corn is a central crop of the US food chain and this is certainly a major unspoken weakness.<br><br>Australia will be hit pretty hard too as our landmass is one of the oldest on the planet and all of our soils are deficient in phosphates. Most of the native plants have evolved to deal with this, however not many have made their way onto the Western table (the Macadamia nut is an exception - most of which are now grown in Hawaii). Which also leaves us with the problem of what to do if the phosphate supplies ever dry up.<br><br>You are correct though that some plants have very long root systems which are able to mine nutrients and minerals from quite a depth. Lucerne is one that comes to mind and it's roots can tap down to at least 4 metres I believe (possibly more). Comfrey, clover, alfalfa are good too. There are heaps of them, but most phosphates are simply lost to the area that they are applied.<br><br>A lot of leaching of minerals occurs due to heavy rain, exposed soil or over watering (which happens more than people would like to admit). It certainly does in commercial orchards where the farmer is paid by weight rather than quality or taste.<br><br>Sustainable agriculture will be a long and interesting journey in itself and best of all, we'll all be along for the ride.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><a href=#c6384252563335409347 title="comment permalink">4/25/10, 2:41 AM</a><br><br>

If anything they resemble philosophies (Theology and ideology are similar phenomena)<br><br>I'm not sure that I can describe this adequately but lets try. Economists model a state of human affairs from a subjective standpoint. That is to say the economist is a working part of the model he describes, and by describing it whilst being a part of events, he modifies the events he is attempting to model. Now this is a terribly confusing position to be in. How can one accurately describe something when the very act of description modifies that which we are attempting to describe? <br>So there are essentially three responses to being in this position:<br>1)Maintain stasis. Insist that the snapshot in time that you originally described is always accurate and label any evidence of changing phenomena as invalid.<br>2)Surf the wave: Understand your place in the changing state of affairs, give up the attempt at accurate modeling and trim your output to influence the state of affairs to your benefit<br>3)Something else (please fill in)<br><br>So no, economics cannot rightfully or honestly claim to be a science, but it may need to in order to be effective if our economist (or economic school) chooses option 2.<br><br><a href=#c5291549910588261183 title="comment permalink">4/25/10, 10:09 PM</a><br><br>

I.e. how could they have depleted their entire forest of palms in order to erect ever bigger monuments--the moai? The answer was probably the same as with the Mayans: that the practice had served them well in the past so they kept at it even though conditions had changed. And like the Mayans the practice had probably employed large numbers of young men from the several tribes they were divided into--better that than warring, which they did later anyway. <br><br>As you say the fundamentals have changed and thus what worked before will not work now and will in fact make things worse. The measure of an economy is its ability to do work. Thus GDP is another way of measuring work done. In a world of declining net energy less work can or will be done. This partly explains the frenzy of financial manipulation in a vain attempt to substitute for the contraction of productive work. <br><br>Loveandlight posts a link to the blog Early Warning which has a very thoughtful post regarding the possibility that Iraq's oil reserves could extent the advent of Peak Oil by up to a decade. Could that happen? Possibly. Would it be a solution? Not in the least. First, 10 years from this point would probably narrow to 5 with accelerated usage especially from China and India. And experience tells us that there is little chance our leaders or anyone else able to make a difference would seize the opportunity to bring alternatives on line. Finally, it is the abundance of fossil fuels (cheap energy) that caused what will be our biggest problem: our efflorescence as a species, positioning us for a collapse and die--off.<br><br>At the risk of quibbling, 'times arrow' is not just a cultural construct.

You can't verbally stroke an atom into submission, but you can verbally stroke people to the same to some extent.<br><br>I completely bypassed the notion that anyone would take economics seriously as a hard science because of this fact. I just don't think anyone can claim it qualifies in that category. I'm sure some do, but I don't know how they could ever be taken seriously. There are too many competing theories about the same thing, and none of them work precisely because human behaviour is involved.<br><br>How many sociologists are right? How many psychologists are right? Physics is pretty much the same in every country in the world, but sociology, psychology, and economics are not.<br><br>Why is Chile by far one of the most successful countries in Latin America and one of the few with a somewhat certain future? Surely nothing to do with Pinochet-driven market reforms?<br><br>Our system is no better than Chavez economics? USSR economics? If not our current system of economics, then what?<br><br>All I am saying is that economic theory has value. It is not trivial and it is not as if we would do just as well without it. It does change and evolve in response to events. Obviously, it's not perfect.<br><br>With respect to the global warming comparison, at a very simplistic level they are observing a short period of warming and trying to attribute it to carbon dioxide buildup and human activity. Many involved are then trying to silence people who want to make it more complicated than that. The huge number of possible interactions in the climate are reduced to simplifications. Climate models have never predicted anything other than future catastrophe, as far as I know. And they can't tell us what we need to do to solve the problem. I do not see much of a difference when compared with economics: valuable, but let's not take it too far.<br><br>Draco, when you harvest resources and use them to make products, you create wealth. There are a lot of "polish blanket tricks" in the economy, but there is still wealth and value being created in many other areas.<br><br><a href=#c8868576203396316279 title="comment permalink">4/28/10, 12:53 PM</a><br><br>

Did you get frost? We escaped by about a degree; but since the black walnut hasn't quite flowered yet my tender plants are still inside and safe anyway! We still have blackberry winter to go, but that rarely includes frost, just a final chance to put on your sweaters and jackets before the warmth arrives to stay.<br><br>Interesting reading about your garden; your recent journey has many parallels to mine (from Colorado to Tennessee) at the beginning of the millenium. I too started out with dense "french intensive," "square foot garden" style interplantings. Over time I came to realize that shade and soil moisture were less important here than were dampness and air circulation, so I opened my beds up some and focused more on rotation than interplanting. I also found that the thick mulches so valuable in Colorado tended to promote damping off and slugs here, and were irresistible lures to chickens. So now I go for bare dirt. My plantings are still in beds, not rows, and my interplant spacing is about half of what is conventional in row cropping, so I met somewhere in the middle. Will be interesting what you find; your microclimate may vary!<br><br>A hippie horticulturist advised me that it can be useful to plant some of the modern hybrids as well as a variety of heirlooms. I live in a fog pocket where fungal diseases can be more a problem due to persistent fog until about 10 a.m. many mornings. I also have found that it's good to plant a wide range of varieties every year, even some that did poorly last year. Moisture and sunlight can vary enormously between years in appalachia, and different varieties will perform with drastically different results between years. 2009 was wet and cloudy and cold; 2008 was hot and sunny. Might as well have moved from Maine to Oklahoma as far as the plants were concerned!<br><br><a href=#c4396419847959388102 title="comment permalink">4/28/10, 3:08 PM</a><br><br>
