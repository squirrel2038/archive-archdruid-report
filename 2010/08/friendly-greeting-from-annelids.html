Over the last few weeks, this blog has sketched out the basic outline of a green wizardry rooted in the appropriate tech movement of the Seventies but reshaped to meet the needs of the deindustrial future now taking shape around us. So far that outline has been drawn on a relatively abstract level; that’s useful as a starting point, but the practical dimension has to be addressed if a project like this is to have any impact at all on the profoundly concrete predicament facing the industrial world.<br><br>Hardly anything is so common nowadays as abstract enthusiasms that never quite find their way down to the messy realm of action in the world. The peak oil blogosphere is a particularly good place to spot them; just look for the people who insist that fourth-generation fission reactors, or fusion power, or algal biodiesel, or ethanol, or – well, you can fill in the blanks yourself – is going to save us all and permit some version of business as usual to continue indefinitely. I’ve already discussed at some length the many reasons why that isn’t going to happen, but set that aside for a moment; even if one or more of these technologies did happen to be a viable response, what actual contribution to that response is made by posting enthusiastic comments about it on internet sites?<br><br>As the old proverb has it, talk is cheap, and talk on the internet seems to be cheaper than most. One of the reasons behind this blog’s recent shift from analysis to action is precisely that we have plenty of the former and not enough of the latter. Thus it’s time to roll up our sleeves, break out the tools, and get grubby. In this post, and over the weeks and months to come, I’ll be examining specific pieces of the appropriate tech toolkit, sharing my experiences with them, and offering tips on at least some of the available resources. Not all my readers will be in a position to use all of the things that will be covered; some of my readers may have been doing one or another of them longer than I have. If you’re in either group, please be patient; many other readers won’t know this stuff, and each of the techniques I’ll be covering casts useful light on green wizardry as a whole, so you may just learn something anyway.<br><br>That latter point is especially true of the subject of this week’s post. Ask a hundred people who don’t practice organic gardening what the heart and soul of a successful organic garden is, and you’ll more than likely get a hundred different answers. Ask a hundred people who do practice organic gardening the same question, and my guess is that a majority of them will give you one answer: the compost bin. What some of them will go on to tell you, and most of the others know intuitively, is that the humble and lovable compost bin is the template on which the entire structure of any future sustainable society will pretty much have to be modeled.<br><br>Step out back with me, at least in some imaginary sense, and you can see how this works. My current compost bin is a roughly cubic object four feet on a side, made of recycled lumber and chicken wire, snugged up to the fence that surrounds my backyard garden. Every day, kitchen scraps and garden waste goes into it; every spring, a wheelbarrow load or two of rich brown dirt comes out of it and gets worked into the garden beds. There’s lesson number one for a sustainable society: the word “garbage” simply means a resource we aren’t clever enough to use yet. <br><br>Lesson number two requires taking a shovel and turning the compost. Once you’ve done that, let me introduce you to a few million of my closest friends: the living things that make compost happen. What organisms you get in a compost bin will be determined by how hot and fast you like to do your compost, and this in turn will be determined by what ingredients you use and how you tend the pile. “Hot,” by the way, is not a metaphor; a compost bin with the right mix of high-nitrogen and high-carbon materials can produce so much heat in the process of decay that you’ll need to hose it down daily in the summer to keep it from catching on fire. In that kind of heat, very little thrives except the thermophilic bacteria that drive the decay process, but they do thrive; a friend of mine still glows with pride when he recalls the compost pile he built in his 4-H days, which hit a peak temperature of 190°F and finished turning its carefully chosen layers of garden and kitchen waste into ripe compost in only fourteen days.<br><br>If you prefer a slower and lazier process, as I do, you can expect to get most of the major animal phyla in your compost bin, along with a bumper crop of fungus and an even larger population of microbes. Most of the critters you can see without magnification will be annelids and arthropods – that is, worms and bugs – and you’ll see a lot of them; a good magnifying glass will show you an even more diverse ecosystem; if you have a microscope handy, put a little of the compost in some distilled water, shake thoroughly, pipette a bit of the water into a well slide, and make the acquaintance of a giddy assortment of single-celled organisms who play their part in turning waste into a resource.<br><br>You also have the option of having a more limited fauna in your compost. People who live in apartments, condominiums, or houses subject to idiotic regulation by homeowner’s associations usually find it more functional to use a specialized form of composter called a worm bin. This is exactly what it sounds like, a bin full of dirt that’s also full of worms. You feed your vegetable scraps to the worms; they devour them, and excrete some of the best fertilizer you’ll find anywhere. Unlike compost bins, worm bins are easy to run indoors, are completely odorless, and can work well on a very small scale; I’ve known single people living alone who kept worm bins, and used the very modest output to keep their potted plants green and growing<br><br>One way or another, the livestock in your compost bin is essential to the composting process; without it, what you get isn’t compost but stinking goo. There’s a reason for this. What happens in a compost bin is exactly what happens in ordinary soil to the vegetable matter that falls onto it in the normal course of nature: decomposers – living things that feed on dead matter – eat it, cycle the nutrients in it through their own life processes, and then excrete those nutrients in forms that plants can use. What makes a compost bin different is that you, the green wizard, tinker with the conditions so that this natural process can happen as quickly and efficiently as possible, so that you can put the results in your garden where you want it. This is where lesson number two for a sustainable society comes in: instead of wasting your time trying to fight nature, figure out what she wants to do anyway, and arrange things so that her actions work to your advantage.<br><br>Lesson number three requires a little more attention to the details of composting. To keep your livestock happy and healthy, the compost needs to be damp but not soggy, and it needs to get plenty of oxygen. You need to be careful not to overdo the nitrogen – for example, too much freshly cut grass from your lawn will turn your bin into a soggy mess that smells of ammonia, because grass that’s still moist and green has too much nitrogen in it. (Leave it lying for a couple of days before raking it up, so that it wilts and starts to turn brown, and then you can add it to your compost bin with good results.) Different styles of composting, fast or slow, have their own detailed requirements, and worm bins have slightly different requirements of their own. <br><br>All these requirements have some wiggle room built into them, but not all that much, and if you stray too far beyond the wiggle room, things won’t work right until you fix the problem. Nothing else will do the job. You can’t bully or wheedle a compost bin; if you give it what it needs, it will give you what you want, and if you don’t, it won’t. It really is as simple as that. This can be generalized into lesson number three for a sustainable society: nature doesn’t negotiate. If you want her to work with you, you have to give her whatever she wants in return. Oh, and by the way, she won’t tell you. You have to figure that part out for yourself, or learn from someone who’s already figured it out.<br><br>At this point those of my readers who don’t already have compost bins full of a couple of million good friends will have divided into two groups. The first group consists of those people who are eager to get to work making compost; the second consists of those people who are backing nervously away from the computer monitor, hoping that annelids, arthropods and thermophilic bacteria don’t crawl through the internet and follow them home. If you’re a member of the latter group, you’ve probably already come up with a hundred plausible explanations why you can’t possibly compost your kitchen scraps, or even tuck a worm bin in the utility closet where it will be odorless, harmless, and comfortably out of the way. Still, you know as well as I do that the hundred plausible explanations aren’t the real reason you don’t want to take up composting. The real reason you don’t want to take up composting is the Squick Factor.<br><br>The Squick Factor is the ingrained and unreasoning terror of biological existence that’s hardwired into the psyches of so many people nowadays. Composting, remember, is about decay. Things put into a compost pile rot, and they get eaten by worms and bugs. Even when you’ve got your compost in a nice expensive bin made of textured recycled black plastic that nobody but a homeowner’s association could find objectionable, and the only scent that comes off it reminds you of summer meadows from childhood and can’t be smelled at all more than six inches away from the bin, composting triggers the Squick Factor in many people. <br><br>There’s another name for the Squick Factor: biophobia. Compost is life – damp, oozing, crawling, slithering, breeding, dying and being reborn – and life in the raw scares the bejesus out of most people in the industrial world these days. It’s an old, old phobia, and weaves its way through the history of ideas from ancient times, showing up with particular clarity in apocalyptic fantasies; still, ours is the first civilization in history that has had, however temporarily, enough energy and resources to let its more privileged classes pursue the fantasy of an existence free from biological realities.<br><br>The squicky feeling many people get when they contemplate putting their overaged bean sprouts into a compost bin is one reflection of our culture’s traditional biophobia. If you’re going to become a green wizard, though, that attitude is one you’re going to have to learn to do without sooner rather than later, because most of what we’ll be doing involves getting elbow deep in life. If the thought of having a compost bin or a worm bin sets off your Squick Factor, it’s important to recognize that fact and accept it, but it’s also important to go ahead anyway, take the plunge, and discover that the worms in your worm bin are the cleanest, quietest, and least demanding pets you’ve ever owned.<br><br>Next week we’ll begin the process of weaving composting into the wider realm of intensive organic gardening, one of the core systems of green wizardry, and make a first pass through some of the ways that the different elements of appropriate tech integrate with one another. In the meantime, if you aren’t composting yet, seriously consider giving it a try; if you are, tell your annelids and arthropods that mine said hi.<br><br><span style=font-size:130%>Resources</span><br><br>Most books on organic gardening have a chapter on composting, and for most purposes the information in those chapters is as much as you need. If you want a book specifically on composting, the classic practical book is <i>Let It Rot!</i> by Stu Campbell, which includes a half dozen different designs for homebuilt compost bins. Green wizards who want to get into the fine details should look for J. Minnich’s <i>The Rodale Guide to Composting<i> and Daniel L. Dindal’s <i>Ecology of Compost</i>. </i></i>For worm bins, the book to get is another classic, Mary Appelhof’s<i><i> <i>Worms Eat My Garbage</i>, </i></i>which covers everything you need to know about this apartment-sized form of composting. <i><i><br><br></i></i>Better than any number of books is a Master Composter program. These exist in some communities, and are worth their weight in fertile topsoil; if you can arrange to take the classes, do the volunteer work, and earn the certificate, you’ll finish the process knowing a heck of a lot more about the fine art of composting than I’ve had space to cover here, and you’ll be prepared to teach it to others, which is an important part of a green wizard’s work.<br><br>If you don’t have a lot of construction skills yet, or your spouse is willing to tolerate a nice textured recycled plastic composting bin in a quiet corner of the backyard but draws the line at chicken wire and recycled lumber, check with your local garden supply or go to any of the dozens of online garden stores. A good but not overpriced compost bin will set you back somewhere between $100 and $150. Don’t get the tumbler kind – those are for batch composting, which only makes sense if you generate large amounts of vegetable matter at a go. The kind you want has a hatch on the top to put in kitchen scraps and yard waste, and a hatch down below to take out finished compost. <i><i><br></i></i>

It somewhat resembled a wide grave, about 6' x 4', only not much deeper that 4' or so. <br><br>Into it my wife has put all the uncooked vegetable matter from our kitchen and most kinds of yard and garden debris. (Some of the tougher woody debris seems to decay too slowly for our uses.) It's still going strong, with only occasional turning by shovel. One early spring we found a frog in it that had spent the winter under the compost, where it was nice and warm. <br><br>The oak tree that overshadows the compost pit sprouted from its acorn around 1900 or 1910. Thanks to the compost pit, it has almost doubled its bulk in the last 30 years. The wood from its windfalls and snowfalls each winter, and from an occasional pruning, goes in to a wood stove. By now our neighbors, none of whom have wood stoves, know that we will happily take their windfalls also. <br><br>To be sure, every two years or so we also buy a cord from someone and pay some young person -- whose joints aren't giving out like ours -- to spend a number of hours carrying and stacking it for us. (We can't get any sort of truck or car very near where the woodpile is, so it's all done with a wheelbarrow and by hand.). Also, we're lazy and have natural gas laid on; but we could cope pretty well if it ever becomes too expensive for us in our lifetime. (We only have about 30 years left at the very, very most, so maybe we won't need to rely wholly on wood by the end of our lives.<br><br>It's not a lot, but every little bit helps.<br><br><a href=#c2069079986686760059 title="comment permalink">8/4/10, 10:12 PM</a><br><br>

Remember that you peel off maybe 5% of the carrot as vegetable waste, then eat the 95%. Those nutrients end up flushed out to sea. So the danger is that we become overly self congratulatory for reclaiming such a tiny amount.<br><br>But on the other hand once someone is practiced in recycling 5% of their nutrient waste, it is a relatively small step to scale up and do all of it (with slightly enhanced techniques for using humanure). So just like growing a few veggies doesn't make you "self sufficient" it does put you in a much better position to do so if you really had to.<br><br>One other point- in hot climates the whole notion of composting is a bit irrelevant. Organic matter breaks down so fast without any encouragement, the aim of the game is to manage continuous nutrient flows as crops grow (liquid feeding). <br><br>For soil carbon humus is useless in warm climates. Biochar is the alternative process, but my trials show it has to be done in place. Digging in charcoal made elsewhere doesnt work. Biochar is another lost art that is only just being rediscovered.<br><br><a href=#c3123704539445639914 title="comment permalink">8/5/10, 12:00 AM</a><br><br>

I have tried a bit of composting in the past but have been reading up &amp; planning for a new venture into serious thermophilic composting. I have the posts and chicken wire up. <br><br>I am planning to bring in bales of straw for a 70 cm "biological sponge" layer at the bottom. The scraps go onto that layer, with some earth and manure, covered over with 25 cm of loose straw as a blanket to help keep heat in as the thermophilic process begins.<br><br>I have heard that a volume of &gt; 1 metre cubed is helpful for starting thermophilic reaction in compost, so I have built my heap container nice and big in the yard outside my kitchen. It's a fairly shady space which is not ideal but the veggies and fruits are getting first choice of the sunnier sites, unless this heap refuses to work in that place.<br><br>Possibly of interest for you green wizard types: did y'all hear that a possible etymology for alchemy is from "al khemy" which is the Egyptian hieroglyphs KHMY via arabic - hieroglyphs mean "black earth"! Either the magic of composting or a kind of terra preta springs to mind. A discovery from my undergraduate days, though I offer my apologies that my study habits were then poor enough that I've not kept in mind who suggested the etymology and where the relevant sources can be found.<br><br><a href=#c8062931582949379212 title="comment permalink">8/5/10, 12:16 AM</a><br><br>

Great stuff!<br><br>One thing that I love particularly about no-till, deep-mulch, raised-bed food-growing -- which is how I've been doing it for some years now -- is the way the bulk of the composting process actually happens in situ, on the upper layers of the beds, above the soil/mulch interface. No need to make bins and transport stuff to an fro with this approach. I do still have a bin too, but that's because I keep a small-scale composting loo aboard my boat/home, and dump its contents regularly into the bin on the bank.<br><br>Otherwise, 'lasagne' mulching, or just the plain Ruth Stout style, with lots of mixed plant material going onto the surface of the beds all round the year as and when it comes available is the easy, and very satisfying, way to do it.<br><br>I'd say that though it's not the no-work form of food growing which some enthusiasts have claimed, it sure as hell beats the digging, forking, raking, hoeing, weeding, etc., of bare-soil growing techniques, and it's a lot less destructive -- not destructive at all, in fact -- to the all-important undisturbed communal life-storm of the living soil community of creatures. In fact, I'd make a case that tillage should be avoided like the plague mainly for that reason.<br><br>Not to spin this comment out too far, I'll just link to a more detailed comment that I posted recently on a 'The Oil Drum' Campfire discussion, which was headlined 'What advice do you have for new gardeners?' That comment also contains a number of highly useful links to websites and You Tube videos that are very pertinent to this practical green wizardry initiative of TAR.<br><br>http://campfire.theoildrum.com/node/6359<br><br>My detailed comment is fourth down from the top, under my name, as always. But as usual with TOD, pretty well all the comments in that long collection are well worth reading.<br><br>BTW, I recommend most strongly the lightweight supertools that are appearing in increasing numbers as the new enthusiasm for scything spreads in the over-developed hitech countries. I use myself a home-made version of the East-European style of scythe, and I've just had a try with a bought scythe of this style which a friend purchased from a maker here in Britain: beautifully light, with a high-quality Austrian blade; a real turbo-charged grass and mulch harvesting tool. As you get into scything, you find that Peter Vido's assertion that their is something Tai Chi-like about the action is really so. (I paraphrase him from memory; something close to that idea anyway) The old scytheman's aphorism that doing scything properly can actually REST you as you work (sic!) really does seem to have something in it.<br><br>Thanks as ever JM for your inspired -- yet highly practical -- wayfinding work. Power to our mucky-up-to-the-elbows arms. Respect!<br><br><a href=#c4079144429990800130 title="comment permalink">8/5/10, 12:20 AM</a><br><br>

I've been quietly hoping that someone would explain to me the operational rudiments and basic design requirements of a composting bin without my having to wade into whole books on the topic. And YouTube vids just haven't proven satisfactory in this regard. <br><br>I confess to having a good deal of the Squick Factor active in my makeup (I once threw a fit over a worm I found in my salad). However once a bin is acquired - probably a worm bin in my case - the main biophobia to deal with will be not my own, but that of family members who are not in on this with me. So I'll probably have to stick the thing outside. Happily my flat has a back yard. <br><br>I hope this isn't too weird a question, but - I've heard of people piping their water through an outdoor compost heap to produce hot water; has anyone successfully used a worm bin to warm things up inside their house? On purpose, I mean. <br><br>Getting back to the squick factor - don't our little crawly friends occasionally get out of the bin and wriggle around the house? Some people (like me) might find that unsettling. <br><br>Oh yeah - and when you buy a worm bin, does it, er... come with worms? Supposing you build one instead, where do you get them? I've never bought a can of worms for fishing or other purposes, so it's all a mystery to me.<br><br><a href=#c486208964829544530 title="comment permalink">8/5/10, 12:41 AM</a><br><br>

Best of all they provide us (and with no other energy input as it's run on gravity) outstanding vermicast (worm poo) and minerals and trace elements, plus returning all used and cleaned water to the soil. It couldn't get any better or simpler. It has no strong odour either as it is a very well drained and ventilated system. <br><br>Now I understand how it is put together and works, I could reproduce it using timber and fly wire if I had to.<br><br>There is the yuk factor for most people though. Just because something flushes out your house plumbing doesn't mean that it has disappeared. It's simply another case of "away" that you mentioned a few posts ago, albeit in a slightly different format.<br><br>Sometime ago I started thinking about soil fertility as a dynamic system. <br><br>Most people tend to think of soil fertility as a static function, but this may because as a society we tend to rely on chemical fertilisers, herbicides, monocultures. As you see the same crops growing in the same spot year after year, it may look as though it is possible to produce these mono crops year in year out when in fact it is a major systemic weakness and will require more inputs from the farmers every year.<br><br>If I drink a coffee with beans that have been sourced from say Byron Bay or Indonesia, I know that if those coffee grounds and my outputs end up in the worm farm then I have in effect transported some of the soil fertility from those areas to mine. Some of the fertility may be lost through the water table via leaching in heavy rains, but most just hangs around getting used by the plants and animals around here.<br><br>If you compost and don't distribute too much of your home grown produce, then you soon become a net importer of soil fertility this way. It doesn't take that much effort either, but it is real wealth because the healthier that your soil is, the more nutrients will be delivered to you and your animals in your own home grown produce.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><a href=#c24195651592099043 title="comment permalink">8/5/10, 2:04 AM</a><br><br>

Better in all ways than putting with other garbage for collection and land-fill. <br>We still have ours outside though. I was given a 'seed lot' of suitable worms as (part of) my retirement present more than a dozen years ago. Conditions are not always ideal for them, but they keep coming. (That reminds me, I need to make our lid aerated. And, they do not like animal remains - I put half a dead rabbit in the large bin once and nearly killed the lot - I suspect H2S poisoning.)<br>We have a very large garden and 3 compost heaps. One for substantial garden materials that can include farmyard manure and be moistened by urine. The second is a large bale of spoiled straw donated by the local farm, covered with a tarp, and receives human urine. The 3rd is the wormery. It has to be rodent proof in our situation otherwise the poor dears will get eaten on occasion. (Seemed to be happening for a while until I fixed it.) Rats in our situation can be significant issue for any heaps that are not caged securely.<br>Separating worms from the excellent compost is not always easy - but laying on a large sheet of black plastic on a hot day seems to do the trick and the worms get repatriated to the large bin.<br>Good luck to all you bio-recyclers.<br><br><a href=#c8469271469404072273 title="comment permalink">8/5/10, 2:30 AM</a><br><br>

Yes we get a wheelbarrow of good dirt out of the compost heap now and then, but it accumulates slowly. That's mostly because the annelids and microbes only seem to get what the neighbors don't swipe. That is, the stuff we discard gets taken by (or as I like to think, "transformed into") crows, jays, raccoons, deer, coyotes, vultures, wasps, flies, and I suspect, fishers, mice and salamanders. Dragonflies, phoebes, red-shouldered hawks, garter snakes and so on hang around -- as though it were some sort of little Serengeti waterhole -- to snap up the visitors. <br>Earlier, when I thought about becoming more dependent on the garden, and protecting my compost a bit from the their depredations, I kind of regretted the unneighborly attitude that goes along with gardening -- kill the bugs, harass the woodchuck, fence out the deer -- but now I'm thinking that if I gardened more, I would just have more compost to share!<br><br><a href=#c3553494250996914501 title="comment permalink">8/5/10, 4:09 AM</a><br><br>

Just a few comments on specific questions: <br><br>Void, thanks for the info about hot climates -- I've spent my life in the temperate zone, and of course any form of agriculture that works with rather than against nature has to vary to take local conditions into account. <br><br>Joel, we'll be talking about cover crops and green manures in the not too distant future. <br><br>Rhisiart, same thing for mulching -- no shortage of useful techniques to discuss!<br><br>Simon, I was in this game in the 1970s and never got out of it, and I've been running the numbers for decades. That's why we won't be talking about composting for 160 acre farms; you use other methods for that kind of agriculture. Composting, using the techniques we're discussing here, is for intensive gardening rather than field agriculture. Your assumptions about yields for organics are also decades out of date; do some research, and you'll find that the yields are comparable to those of chemical methods. <br><br>By the way, Bussard's "polywell fusion" is simply a rehash of the old Farnsworth fusor from the 1960s, a neat laboratory curiosity but not an energy source. Seife's <i>Sun In A Bottle</i> does a good job of cutting through the hype. <br><br>Kevin, you don't have to worry about worms crawling all over the house! They stay where it's nice and damp, in the bin. If you Google "vermicomposting" you can access sites that will sell you worms, bin and all. <br><br>Cherokee, excellent. As it happens, we'll be discussing soil as an ecosystem shortly. <br><br>Andy, that's fascinating. We certainly get birds hanging around the compost bin to snap up unwary insects, but that's about it. <br><br>DIYer, we'll be talking about toads in the not too distant future.

Astounding John!

I bought one thinking it could be used inside or out, as the promo suggested, but it came with the admonishments to keep it where temps were below 85, above 40, no direct sun and no rain. Having no such place out of doors, it ended up in my kitchen. There is, as others pointed out, no odor and the worms stay put -- they do not like light and will not stray from home. I did have problems with fruit flies until I stopped adding fruit and vegetable scraps -- I now add only egg shells (dried and crushed), coffee grounds, tea bags and paper. Other scraps go out in the tumbling compost bin -- which, as JMG warned, was an expensive mistake. Once a tumbling bin gets a load going it would take Superman to turn it. But I have it and use it. As for worm bins, you can easily make your own -- lots of advice if you Google 'worm bin.' Just make sure to get red wiggler worms not night crawlers. <br><br>On another note, Will Allen at http://www.growingpower.org/ uses the hot composting method to keep his greenhouses warm all winter.

I've been composting steadily since we bought our house 5 years ago, sporadically much longer than that. My parents have been composting for about 35 years. <br><br>My bin was provided by the county extension service. It is a 3'x 10' sheet of stiff black plastic with 2" holes distributed throughout. It is joined by 2 bolts at the short ends to form a cylinder about 3' high by 3' in diameter. I plan to construct bins out of straw or hay bales, which will eventually become part of the compost, but this simple bin and some chicken wire hoops of similar dimension have served me well so far.<br><br>I've gone through different methods ranging from frequent turning to no turning. Besides vegetable scraps I add all kinds of stuff that you're not supposed to add: fish and shellfish scraps, bones (after boiling them for stock), dairy, grease (absorbed into paper or dry leaves). I too have recently been influenced and encouraged by Jenkins' approach. I don't turn the compost, but scrape a "basin" in the top, until I start to see yesterday's additions, add my kitchen scraps, then bury well with wet straw. <br><br>Turning is hard work and seems disruptive to the creatures in the pile; I'd rather let them do the heavy lifting.<br><br>I think the biggest piece of advice I could give, at least for humid temperate to subtropical climes like mine, is that it's hard to go wrong with straw. Straw is enough of a "brown" material (i.e. high carbon/low nitrogen) to balance out most other inputs, but not so low in N as to seriously stifle the process if you use too much (straw will eventually compost all by itself). It provides excellent aeration and refuge for worms and other critters, especially if the center of the heap gets too hot for them.<br><br>This year I'm also experimenting with straw bale gardening, which will provide more compost and mulch as the bales break down. Overall I've been moving toward less mowing and digging. I've been figuring out ways to work with the weeds and trees that sprout in the garden rather than digging them out by the roots, something akin to the coppicing and hedge-witchery practices of old England. Some of the weeds are good eating, or at least more good mulch and compost material.<br><br><a href=#c310780084393528508 title="comment permalink">8/5/10, 6:31 AM</a><br><br>

Soil organic matter is the foundation of natural soil fertility in virtually all soils worldwide, including in the warm, wet tropics. The turnover rate is higher, of course, but everything happens faster in the tropics. SOM decomposition in Brazil is only about twice as fast as it is in Tennessee, which does not change the nature of the game at all. It's true that you can deplete natural SOM and natural soil fertility more rapidly in warmer and wetter climates IF you are using unsustainable agricultural practices. It's also true that if you have just clearcut a rain forest there is a larger fraction of the natural SOM in the surface layers and forest floor which can burn away pretty quickly if not managed well. That is also true on some northern soils. You can ruin any soil if you mistreat it, and then have to spend decades coaxing it back to life. <br><br>The problems between soils are often more related to physical substrate differences than broad climate zones -- sand is hard to get anything retained in, for instance, no matter what climate zone you are in. Still, when we lived in a sandbox in subtropical rainy coastal South Carolina we managed to eventually build up nice fertile nutrient-retaining soil (in spite of hardly knowing what we were doing) with just plain old-fashioned compost and manure additions over the years. Oxisols (a.k.a. "latterite"), which are common in the tropics, can also go bad really fast if poorly treated -- this is a function of the nature of their clay minerals. not the behavior of their SOM. <br><br>The natural cycles of carbon and nitrogen in soil follow the same general patterns worldwide. You don't have to invoke high-tech bioengineering principles or synthetic materials like biochar even if you are in the middle of a rain forest. <br><br>But you do need to learn something about where you live and what the problems and advantages of your own local geography and pedology are.<br><br><a href=#c3750067110610943816 title="comment permalink">8/5/10, 6:59 AM</a><br><br>

The name of the game is to get partly decomposed organic matter in the root zone of your plants that has a good ratio of carbon to nitrogen, and have this in an environment that has enough air in it that it'll continue to break down slowly and release good stuff for the plants. Keep the big picture in mind (those basic ecology texts oughta cover it) and all the particular variants make more sense. <br><br>Critters and compost working together are good at accomplishing this; other things work that way too. Sometimes digging the soil lets in too much air and speeds the decomposition too much, so too many nutrients come out too fast and get washed away. Other times the soil is too packed down and dense, and it needs to be loosened up somehow. Digging can to this; over a longer time scale so can worms, ants (even the despised fire ant), plant roots, etc. There's not a one-size-fits-all, not even within one single plot. If your garden plot is located where the previous owner used to park his old truck on one side and where he used to pile the raked leaves on the other side, you'll have to take completely different approaches to the two halves of your one small garden!<br><br><a href=#c7349042679002183597 title="comment permalink">8/5/10, 7:26 AM</a><br><br>

If the <i>worst case scenario</i> occurs this winter, we'll have squash to sustain us ;).<br><br>I would like to offer a comment here about those fancy (read: expensive) rotating drum composters and say, unless one wishes to spend a great deal of time tending one's compost and adding special ingredients to help with the break down process, the compost pile works much better - at least in my experience. We've always had a (fairly unsightly) compost pile, usually made of three pallets lashed together with an open front, but a few years ago we were trying to improve the aesthetics of our suburban nanofarm, and so we bought a composter. It never worked nearly as well as the pile, and we ended up giving it away to some friends, who also say that it doesn't work very well for them. My mother-in-law has a smaller version of ours, and hers doesn't work very well, either. I suppose it probably would work well for someone who had the interest in taking the time to make it work, or perhaps it was that it's just too cold here in Maine for it to really do a good job - regardless of the reason, for us, tossing everything in a pile works so much better.<br><br>And gives us a bonus potato crop and squash crop, to boot *grin*.<br><br><a href=#c8694520361539738766 title="comment permalink">8/5/10, 7:31 AM</a><br><br>

I see the wrong perceptual “fork in the road” that Western society took post-Renaissance as being crucial to our present predicament – and unless or until that is corrected (I know that’s a tall order!), we ourselves as Green Wizards-to-be will ourselves unintentionally perpetuate this perceptual dysfunction. I had been hoping that with the title of “wizard” for the course, we would be delving into the issue of perception, for a wizard without wisdom is merely a mechanic or a walking encyclopedia! <br><br>Now I see that I was simply being impatient: your July 28 posting (re: intentionality) cleared my misconceptions. And now, with your weaving of “lessons for a sustainable society” into a description of a key practice of green wizardry (composting), it is clear that you are integrating the “philosophy” with the “practical”. Well done! <br><br>I am also delighted with the calibre of my fellow-readers and their helpfulness in pointing out relevant documents/projects. Definitely some good synergies are developing here!<br><br>Rest assured that a couple of copies of the Master Conserver course materials are in safe hands in Toronto.

At the time I had not even heard of geomancy (somehow my undergrad humanities courses on the Renaissance conveniently neglected it), but since then I have been devoting nearly all of my free time to it, and have been poring over your book numerous times in the old-fashioned style of study you described in your July 7 post, besides practicing it on a daily basis. It has been an extremely rewarding experience! In gratitude, I am using a geomantic moniker for communication on the blog – the one that best seems to describe my character (for all the strengths and weaknesses it entails). Now I am being torn between my passion for geomancy and my latest passion – Green Wizardry!<br><br>Our lives have many parallels, including lifelong interests in the mystical/esoteric, ancient and foreign cultures, great admiration for both Schumaker and Gandhi, and careers as writers. Not to mention a great love of appropriate technology. One of my great passions while earning a degree in Environmental Studies was biogas (easy in tropical climes; challenging in Canada). We are also the same age.

His book, The New Organic Gardner is a very good source on commercial vegetable production, and I hope would answer some of M Simon's comments about scale. Yes, it's doable, and it doesn't take a great big heap. Coleman gives a basic conceptual outline for growing your own compost crop. It works, but obviously, you have to substitute land for artificial inputs. That means a lower yield per acre if you were to compare it with growing crops on those acres with artificial inputs. In many cases, that's not a practical alternative, anyway for reasons of soil suitability, slope, water availability, etc.<br><br>So I'm going to have to come down in agreement with the one tiny nugget of truth in M Simon's last paragraph. I don't think real sustainable (as opposed to "organic") agriculture can support the current human population. Well, I think anyone would have to agree that, in the absence of some technological fix that doesn't presently exist, that's just the way it is.

If the bin is home made, it will have to be designed to drain well, and worms need a moderate temperature, neither freezing, nor cooking. They can't handle vegetables with harsh oils such as onions and hot peppers. While there's no notable smell, there's an occasional crop of fruit flies that that can be decimated with a glass bottle holding some sweet wine. My worms enjoy non-glossy newsprint as a substrate, and it's fun to peek in occasionally to watch for baby worms and figure out what the most popular scraps are. You will occasionally have to touch one to shoo one away from the lid, but doing so is far less gross than accidentally killing one and ending up with dried worm near the top of the bin. If you don't mind the squirminess and slime, they're some of the most charming and inoffensive pets around.<br><br>Mr. Greer, I'm glad you're getting into the hands-on stuff, but I have a slight concern. It's probably too late to keep things light, but I hope you can keep them approachable for the average layman (or woman). <br><br>Long story short, I'm 28, can make or repair many things made of wood, metal or cloth, handle docile animals and know a tiny bit of scratch cooking. But my Lemon Balm and zucchini are kicking the bucket, the cool summer is wreaking havoc with the tomatoes, and my Chamomile tincture looks vaguely terrifying. More terrifying is the realization that I am actually ahead of the curve. So when I see sites or blogs about growing and canning umpteen things from scratch weekly, cooking very complicated things, doing without cars and refrigerators and living in such a sparse way that most Europeans would wince, my eyes glaze over, my brain locks up, and I conclude that we're all going to starve/bake/freeze/die of minor infection or be devoured by coyotes. And so I click several sites over to look at what those cute little LOLcats are doing.<br><br>I'm sure you're aware of the risk of brain-freeze, but I had to mention it. Anyway, thank you for your blog.<br><br><a href=#c8529167995968648446 title="comment permalink">8/5/10, 4:17 PM</a><br><br>

I had a worm box for over 3 years and also had two different compost piles (I was living in So CA at the time), while one was finishing, I stated adding things to the other one. When I located to another state, it was too big, so I had to sell it. I now have another one.Yippee...

Martin. I found it especially user friendly,easy to understand,and liked how it went more into the 30:1 ratio necessary for the pile. In 2009, I took a master Composting class, and during the class we spent one day at the local community garden. They showed us several tumblers, and said for various reasons they don't work anywhere near as well as they were hoping. (I relocated again after taking that class..)<br>Since Biochar has been mentioned again, I've tried before to comment that there are 3 Yahoo listservs that I know of for info. BioChar, Biochar Soils, and BioChar Production. I also went to a Biochar conference last year that was very exciting.

By way of explanation, I live (camp out) in the back of my store. I have one big window that faces east. I keep the books back out of the sun and have put a large plant stand in the front window. <br><br>I bought one of those big 11 x 17 x 22 inch plastic storage containers on sale with lid. I drilled three drain holes at one end. I nailed together an oblong of 2 x 4s and slipped it under the bin with a piece of 2 x 4 under the end away from the drain holes to give it a pitch so the "worm juice" will drain into a container. <br><br>I had to travel a distance to get the right red worms and they were a bit pricey, I thought. $25 a pound. But, I figure I can sell off some or swap for produce. Or the pleasure of just gifting them. I have named every one of them. I started out with some shredded newspaper the the dirt from a couple of pot of failed houseplants.<br><br>I drink a lot of coffee and tea and eat a banana and apple a day. I keep the scraps in a plastic bread wrapper and once a week, dig out a hole and put the scraps in. I rotate around the outside of the box. Corner, halfway down the long side, corner, corner, etc. So, one go around is about 7 weeks which seems long enough to have everything break down.<br><br>I take a good stiff piece of cardboard, bent in the middle. I scoop out 3 or so big servings of dirt and pick through for the worms and return the to the box. Bend cardboard and slide all into a gallon storage bag. I have 4 bags reserve.<br><br>Problems and observations: Coffee filters (the brown ones) and tea bags seem to lump into hard little dry nuggets. Maybe more shredding. But with my CSA box, I've got more then enough scraps. Sometimes I skip a week, just to let everything REALLY break down. <br><br>Squick factor. The worm juice really looks nasty, but doesn't smell at all. And, it saved some miniature roses I had that had almost been overcome by fungus. They tripled in size, overcame the fungus and bloomed! Had fruit flies. Used some little plastic apple things that worked, but I didn't feel good about. More on organic fruit fly control please! Sweet wine (or sugar water?) and what kind of a bottle. Anyone have an organic control for wool moths?<br><br>Before the worm box, I had problems with mice and once, rats. I was running a regular trap line every 6 seeks. Then I got semi-feral kitty. Not a problem since.<br><br>That window and plant stand. I have a few miniature roses and christmas cactus (to feed my soul), mint and sweet basil. I'm looking into two tea plants (Raintree Nursery) and am thinking of ginger and a small edible bamboo. I'm thinking, not only things I eat, but slightly offbeat things I might be able to trade other things for. Things that everyone isn't growing. Kind of off topic, but I also just picked up two mushroom growing kits from Fungi Perfecti.

I use a bungee cord to keep the lid on. I put only fruit and vegetable scraps and eggshells in it and after two years I have some decent compost (though there are still bits of egg shell in it). So it's been extremely slow. <br><br>I have a number of theories about why it's been so slow: 1) this is Northern Michigan and it's often quite cool at night even in the hottest days of our short summer; 2) I used only greens and should have added more browns; 3) it's buried in soil that is mostly sand so maybe the environment is not conducive to worms as a less sandy soil would be (the worms are supposed to be able to get in through the holes drilled in the garbage can); 4) it's close to the house but in an area that is shady at least half the day; 5) I never stirred it up; 6) it may not be big enough in volume to produce a hot compost.<br><br>I have a second digester to which I'm adding more browns (maple leaves) and stirring it a bit. I'm also thinking of moving the digesters to a warmer spot. We'll see how it goes. <br><br>But even though it's slow, it's very easy, and I've had no troubles with any kind of animals. The product from the first is black and smells very good as you would expect earth to smell. So I would recommend this to anyone who wants something simple. You are bound to have faster results than I have, no matter what you do!<br><br>P.S. I'm glad to hear that the rotating ones don't work.

You only need enough to cover the bottom of the bottle and compensate for evaporation so there's no island of glass in the middle for the fruit flies to crawl on. Sugar water might work, as might other beverages, but I haven't experimented much. <br><br>For the bottle, any beer or wine bottle with a smooth lip will work. An amber or darker bottle will avoid the squick factor of watching fruit flies drown.<br><br>If the bottle with sweet wine at the bottom is placed near where they fly around and their food sources are minimized, they become lured by the sweet scent, land on the lip of the bottle, where the alcohol fumes, slick glass edge and their natural talent at drowning in beverages does them in. It's not super-potent, and the liquid needs to be replaced and the bottle washed now and then, but it's simple and safe.<br><br>If the flies are actually in the worm bin, placing strips of newspaper over the food makes it difficult for them to access it.

I've been on the verge of constructing a compost bin out of reclaimed this and that for over a dozen years now, but every time I think about doing it, I feel like napping, so it never quite gets done. And even having the compost pile carefully tucked away in a corner of the yard ended up being too much work, so I moved it closer, into the garden.<br><br>Here's what we do: Each year, we pick out a section of the veggie garden to be the recipient of the new pile. This has the dual benefits of forcing us to leave a section of the garden fallow for a while, as well as giving that plot a boost from the compost the next year. We start it with the undigested leftovers from the previous pile, and toss in garden debris, food scraps, and possibly some supplementary leaves as the spring &amp; summer go along. A stir with a pitchfork every now &amp; then is about all the maintenance I do — with the exception of adding some water when it's particularly dry. When we clean up the garden in the fall, we put the chopped up remnants into the pile, which makes it big enough to hold some heat as the outside temperature cools and to have enough space to dump kitchen scraps over the winter. Next spring, I rake out the undigested bits, start the next pile somewhere else, and fight over whose veggies get the best bed for that year.<br><br>Some other helpful hints:<br><br>Save your leaves — you'll be glad next Spring &amp; Summer when you want something that's not green &amp; growing. Never, ever rake up your leaves and throw them away! If you can't absorb them all for some reason, give them to someone else who's composting.<br><br>Control your moisture (&amp; temperature) with plastic. In the rainy season, it keeps the pile from getting soggy. In the dry season, it keeps moisture from escaping too fast. This isn't a deindustrially sustainable practice, but for now, we're drowning in scrap plastic. I think our current cover is the plastic wrap from some insulation I installed a while ago. I've also used mattress bags, garbage bags, various packing materials, and many other large pieces of plastic that have too many holes for their intended use, but are too good to just throw away. I've found that if I use translucent plastic, it works as a nice greenhouse as Spring shows up, helping all the volunteers from the compost get a head start. The one thing to watch out for, is that UV light degrades plastic and turns it into a brittle sheet that will eventually crumble into pieces. Replace it before you have to pick out hundreds of tiny pieces of plastic from your garden bed…<br><br>Be careful with weeds. Weed seeds can survive many adverse conditions — that's why they're ever-present! A lazy compost pile doesn't faze them a bit. Since I'm so lazy, I rarely get to the weeds before they go to seed, so we've ended up with a separate weed compost pile in the corner of the yard. I still don't know what I'm going to do with all the weedy compost we've generated. Maybe if we get chickens, I'll let them take care of it.<br><br>Mind the gaps. Adding larger, slower composting pieces (straw, plant stalks, even small sticks) to the pile helps keep open spaces that allow air to circulate. They also tend to form a self-supporting structure that can keep the pile from collapsing.<br><br>The <i>Rodale Book of Composting</i> (the "current" 1992 update edited by Gershuny &amp; Martin) was my starter guide before I dug into the Master Composting world. It's easy to get into, with some nice lists of what kinds of items work well, but also has more technical information for those who are interested.<br><br>Happy decomposing!<br><br><a href=#c4938295463750528099 title="comment permalink">8/6/10, 1:30 AM</a><br><br>

Garden variety weeds like dandelions, etc. are fine as long as you make sure you incorporate the plants before they go to seed!<br><br>- Regarding a community garden compost system, one that we used at a local garden relied on a three-bin system. Someone constructed (local Boy Scouts, I think) a fairly large structure that was three 4 ft x 4 ft. x 4 ft. cubes linked together. They had removable panels on the front of each bin, and hinged tops with plastic roofing to control moisture. The bottoms were open to the ground, but we used ground cloth to keep out any weeds.<br><br>Our system involved gathering enough material each week to fill the left-most bin. The material consisted of any garden debris we could convince the gardeners to give us, plus spoiled produce from a local grocery store, plus leaves from a huge pile dropped off by city collection trucks the previous fall. Everything was chopped and thoroughly mixed and put in the bin. (The prep part was always the most laborious and fun — we never knew if we would be smooshing up boxes of rotten tomatoes, or chopping up moldy melons — and 4x4x4 is a lot of organic matter!)<br><br>The second week, we would turn the first pile into the middle bin and build a new pile in the left-hand bin.<br><br>The third week, we would turn the first pile from the middle bin into the right-hand bin, turn the second pile from the left into the middle, and build a new pile in the left-hand bin.<br><br>The fourth week, we would "harvest" the compost from the right-hand bin and keep the piles moving.<br><br>It was a fairly labor-intensive but quick way to compost. There's no need to do it as fast as we did, other than the ease of saying, "Let's meet every Saturday at 10a to do the compost." And there's some benefit to doing it more slowly, as the "finished" compost needed another couple of weeks to age before using it on the garden.<br><br><a href=#c7883092171553324660 title="comment permalink">8/6/10, 1:42 AM</a><br><br>

It is available on the Earthgarden website under the section Good Life Book club. <br><br>Why is it a special book? It covers issues such as: soil; what plant needs what?; How to use fertilisers; green manures; animal manures; composting; mulching; and finishes with examples of 10 different gardens in various situations and what would suit each. Hope I'm not sounding like an advertisement?<br><br>Why is it important? Well, I've met Jackie and seen her mixed food forest and she has an observational approach to nature and can explain complex issues in very simple English. In addition to this she does not get bogged down by traditions and is prepared to take a fresh look at what actually works and gives everything a go.<br><br>For those of you in other countries, there may be much to learn as well, because in Australia we have the poorest soils and harshest growing conditions of any continent save Antarctica. On Jackie's land she endured 90 consecutive days of temperatures over 40 degrees Celsius (that's over 104 degrees for you non metric people) and from what I've seen it's an absolute oasis which she shares with the local native animals. Much respect! <br><br>If we achieve that with organic methods in these conditions then there really is no excuse in other more fertile and temperate parts of the world for others not to give it a go.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><a href=#c5718506513003241120 title="comment permalink">8/6/10, 3:44 AM</a><br><br>

Peter takes an unorthodox look at the Australian environment and it's natural systems and applies (also) an observational approach to broad acre farm practices.

Seeing in real life is worth hundreds of books!! And it’s important to attend and make these connections before funding gets cut. I had the good fortune of attending a free two-hour workshop two summers ago, prompted by this very blog, no less, and I can't stress how valuable it was. Now it's no longer offered since funding was cut soon after. They also stopped selling discount bins, but some communities might still do this. <br><br>What I think poses the greatest risk of turning people off to composting (more than just being biophobic) are those who try it, do something wrong, get some horrendous smell, and never try it again. ("But you promised me it wouldn't smell !!!........ Now my neighbors/spouse/parents/children despise me, and despise composting to!!" ) <br><br>A lot of beginners who try composting are going to make some kind of mistake, and I'd hate to see anyone give up once they’ve got that far. That's why it’s so important to actually interact with someone who's done it before, and is still doing it. An “expert” can correct your mistakes in time, before you get served divorce papers or an eviction notice.<br><br><br>More Resources<br><br>I would like to recommend a couple of inexpensive booklets for those who are too busy or too impatient to read a whole book: <br><br>- Home Composting Made Easy by C.

I'm doing some ag research as a matter of personal curiosity, and I recently learned from the US Dept. of Ag's 2007 Ag Census that, out of ~300,000 harvested acres that year, only about 6,000 were used to grow "vegetables" (which include everything humans eat, from potatoes to sweet corn). All the rest (or 98%) were used, more or less, to grow fodder for animals. Then most of those animals were shipped out on a plume (where have I heard <i>that</i> word recently...?) of diesel smoke to Philly, NYC, etc.<br><br>Further, LancCo has about 6,250 "farmers hunters miners loggers", which is the BLS's catch-all for people who work in primary production, which means less than 1.25% (out of 500,000 people) of Lancaster's population are farmers. This compares to around 67% of the nation's population as farmers in 1840, the year of the first Ag Census. There are actually <i>fewer</i> farmers now than there were 170 years ago, if you can believe that.<br><br>So, anyway, it's fair to say our farming is highly unsustainable and highly petro-dependent. And more than fair to say that the future for most of us holds a transition from whatever-we're-doing-now to farming, in one fashion or other.<br><br><a href=#c2927823698026122687 title="comment permalink">8/6/10, 7:09 AM</a><br><br>

You can do this by putting the worm farm on the ground - this will assist drainage too. They will always come back as the worm farm is an easy feed for them. <br><br>Make sure rodents can't get into the worm farm by using fly wire (preferably metal - stainless steel is best - aluminium is good too - don't use fibreglass as the rodents can get through this easily).<br><br>Some people say that you can't put this or that into a worm farm. This is not true. You simply need to provide a varied diet with not too much of any one variety. They'll even get through paper and cardboard, but they need a lot of other fruit and vegie scraps as well and remember to get some air into it if you're doing this! Even citrus and onion skins are OK too.<br><br>To Jim Brewster:<br><br>The reason that we have centralised facilities for processing our waste is because of historic and human reasons and not because we live in a nanny state.<br><br>1890 in Melbourne was a bad time not only because of the depression, but because Melbourne had a very high incidence of typhoid and cholera. This occurred because it was common practice at the time to collect human waste by horse and cart (the so called night cart) from the back of peoples properties (hence all the lanes in inner Melbourne) and then dump it in the local creeks and rivers. Not good from a disease point of view. The government at the time established a huge grass filtration and wetland treatment system in the south west of the city and connected everyone in metropolitan Melbourne up to this system. It reduced the incidence of cholera and typhoid to negligible amounts.<br><br>You might notice that when there are disasters such major flooding in the world it is always accompanied by typhoid and cholera outbreaks (or fears of them). This is something you don't have to think about in the West.<br><br>The other thing to note, is that it doesn't take too many people bypassing this system (ie. raw sewage in storm water) before this becomes a problem again.<br><br>I am not referring to people who compost their own wastes either. Much respect to them.<br><br>You don't have to imagine what would quickly happen if the pumps that now move the raw sewage to treatment facilities stopped working.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><a href=#c5718242437597723505 title="comment permalink">8/6/10, 5:21 PM</a><br><br>

The piles of manure, hay and straw that accumulate in the winter pen are allowed to settle in place until midsummer (if you try to move them in spring, you just haul a lot of unnecessary weight and moisture) and then shoveled into a pile encased by a few widely spaced boards to provide a bit of a cosmetic boundary. There are actually two piles: everything from one year cooks for a winter and a summer (in the fall you can see it steaming, in winter it freezes solid, but that helps the breakdown too). The next summer, the older pile is done and the dirt it made is moved to the garden (or wherever it is needed - we’re also leveling some ground around the house) and the cycle starts again.<br><br>The straw is indeed a key ingredient – one year when I had mostly hay (equivalent of grass clippings), the pile took much longer to cook down and was still full of chunks long after I’d expected it to be finished. We are inconsistent with our kitchen waste – sometimes we add it to the ongoing winter pile, sometimes we make a new pile in a more convenient and then just bury it with finished compost when we get around to it.<br><br>One trick I’ve discovered that is probably useful for city and farm dwellers alike is to screen the finished compost. I found a chunk of metal grating (it’s got diamond shaped holes about a centimeter in size) which fits over a bucket or wheelbarrow, then I shovel a handful of compost onto the grate, and smush it around a bit with my gloved hand or my little hand shovel. Small fine bits go through and into the bucket, bigger unfinished bits are just shoved to the side for further composting. I put the bigger, maybe-not-quite-finished compost at the bottom of my containers or grow potatoes in it (potatoes will grow in ANYTHING I think), but for seed starting and growing things that like a more tightly packed soil, this really helps. There are fancier screening devices you can build (Solomons has a nice picture in Gardening when it Counts) or buy (Lee Valley sells an oversided ‘food mill’ for screening compost) but the grate works.<br><br><a href=#c2201960710593568333 title="comment permalink">8/7/10, 9:14 AM</a><br><br>

A trace of TiO2 dust to make the fiber on the interior side white. The fiber is recycled newspaper or equivalent. Probably some other ingredients, not sure what they might be. Note that the stuff that makes plaster harden is the hemihydrate, a slightly dried-out version of it. <br><br>Depending on your soil chemistry, the benefit may vary -- gardening manuals usually advise you to add gypsum to a clay soil if it is too dense and sticky. It might also be good for overly sandy soil, to retain moisture. On the other hand, almost nothing will grow in pure gypsum, so use it in moderation. I'm not sure what its effect is on soil pH.<br><br><a href=#c8202635162507531514 title="comment permalink">8/7/10, 12:58 PM</a><br><br>

Its problem was a slight imbalance -- not quite enough Ca to neutralize the SO4, which takes the form of sulfuric acid. The acidic sheetrock simply rusted away the nails that held it up and it fell off the walls of tract houses built with it. I believe the lawsuits from that little boo-boo are still ongoing. <br><br>A little extra sulfate would be OK here in central Texas where we have alkaline limestone soil. Of course there's no telling what _else_ is in it, since China has no environmental regulations. <br><br>Now that I think about it, I wouldn't use sheetrock in a food garden unless it really needs the soil amendment. The ground up bones mentioned above are a great source of phosphate, but gypsum doesn't contribute much that's essential, and garden-quality mineral gypsum is really cheap.<br><br><a href=#c92674443804555913 title="comment permalink">8/7/10, 3:54 PM</a><br><br>

Rittenhouse. Amazon has several used copies. It's a picture book, but the illustrations are detailed. <br><br>As Don Plummer noted, carriage building is definitely alive outside Amish country. Right now, some breed shows, for example Morgans, feature vintage carriage classes, and the sport of combined driving--three day eventing sans fences--can require a fancy presentation vehicle, a tank solid cross-country vehicle, and a nimble vehicle for the obstacle phase. <br><br>For driving basics, I also recommend Heike Bean and Sarah Blanchard's _Carriage Driving_. While the focus is training the horse not manufacturing the carriage, it's a good starting point since it explains the basics of safe design. Furthermore, reading this book would be of value to those interested in carriage building because I doubt that someone unfamiliar with the conformation and mentality of the horse and/or how it's schooled could become a topnotch builder. <br><br>As with riding, this is an area where apprenticeship is usually the best way to learn. Finding driver/builders is actually pretty easy. Where there's a driving club, there's usually someone who restores or builds carts and carriages. Finding these clubs usually isn't hard because the names are usually straightforward, e.g. I recently hung out at a practice day with members of the Colorado Driving Society. <br><br>By the way, driving horses is DANGEROUS. Riding is, according to some surveys at least, the most dangerous sport, but that's only because I've never seen a study that included driving, which is a quantum leap past riding as far as potential dangers.

I always use two compost bins. One is active, i.e. being continuously filled. The other one is emptied of its nutritious content when the first one is full. Then they switch roles. This is IMO better than filling at the top and taking out at the bottom.<br>2. A single family does not generate enough organic kitchen waste to keep the compost going in cooler climates/seasons. So a compost cooperation with a couple of neighbours is a good idea. I live in an apartment block where we compost together with some of our neighbours. This keeps the compost "well fed" so that it is warm enough to even do its job during freezing winter temperatures.<br><br><a href=#c773049264125733014 title="comment permalink">8/9/10, 5:26 AM</a><br><br>

She gets her "organic raw honey" from a local guy who <i>doesn't</i> move his hives around much. He keeps them where he knows no nearby farmers spray petrochemicals. Several years ago, as the story has it, his bees started dying in great numbers. Whereas many comparable apiarists began spraying antibiotics, anti-virals, etc., on their beehives, he did nothing. He let most of his bees die, then carefully stewarded the remains of the hives back to health and abundance.

I also picked up a copy of "Let it Rot" and found no Comfrey. So I must tell you about the wonders of Comfrey and point you towards Steve Solomon's website. Google the Soil and Health Library. Most of you probably have Steve's book "Gardening When it Counts" and if you don''t you should have. But the most wonderful thing about Steve is that he has a library of old books about agriculture and farming. I can recommend the book "Russian Comfrey" by Lawrence W. Hills, written in about 1949 and "The Natural Way of Farming" by Masanobu Fukoka. I got both of these from Steve in pdf form. Both of these books, but especially Hill's, discuss the importance of comfrey as a feed, a soil improver and a compost maker. <br><br>For the past ten years I have been experimenting with various ways of raising chickens and trying to cut down on the expensive processed concentrates while improving soil with chicken (and horse) manure. I am combining composting of comfrey with vermiculture. The comfrey is planted around the chicken coop with its attached greenhouse (built of cattle panels.) It is planted in horse and chicken manure that has been mixed with peat moss or shredded oak leaves. The worms are living in beds inside the hoophouse with screens and pallets over them so the chickens can't eat them unless we open up a door for them. The worms are fed comfrey and, of course, chicken droppings. <br>We shall see how far through the winter I can keep raising enough worms and comfrey to supplement the expensive chicken feed.<br>Comfrey has roots that go down many feet. They are bio accumulators bringing calcium and other minerals into their leaves and roots which, when they rot, enrich the soil. They also provide forage for goats and other animals. Extra milk for the goats provides accessible protein for the chickens. Who knew they loved to drink whole milk. (No skimmed milk for them.) <br>No compost heap is complete without a bit of comfrey!<br><br><a href=#c8655847510186542408 title="comment permalink">8/9/10, 9:43 PM</a><br><br>

As most of the "composting" worms are invasive species to the US, you most likely already have them in your yard. Under 5 inches, pigmented and found in the upper layers of soil. If someone tells you only E. Foetida can do the job.. it's because they don't have a clue. Very few in the US can actually positively ID the various species, and even then some require DNA testing to verify. You can compost with any earthworms, just the epigeic (upper soil level dwellers) are the best candidates because they don't burrow, live in the upper soil layers and their habits are best suited for living in a bin. They have a simple brain structure.. in short only reason they would be motivated to leave a bin is because something in the environment is off.. and no other reason.<br><br>Hot composting.. you don't want the temperature to get to 190.. you really don't want it over 160 as it is just losing more nitrogen faster. At 160 for a few days is hot enough to kill weed seeds, many pathogens, cysts, etc. and also is the max temp. the thermophilic bacteria in the pile process. The pile can be made without aything.. and just be a pile. If you do drop cash on anything more than chicken wire, keep this in mind.. how easy is it to turn? I have one of those bins from a neighbor and although it is nice to keep out the rain, it is a pain to turn (and the edges are sharp, so be cautious or slice your hand open like I did).

Jenkins says that turning just accelerates nitrogen loss without significantly contributing to the oxygen content of the pile. He says if you are really concerned about oxygen levels just make sure, when you build the pile, to insert large, bulky items like hay, which will trap air pockets. Mostly, he says, the microbes take care of themselves.

I have been reading regularly, but not comment. Composting is to close to my heart to let it go by. <br><br>I may be JMG's 4H kid? At least i remember a vast rambling conversation covering those topics, and the coming events, all while ironically standing in the frozen food aisle of the supermarket. That was a weird day, but so appropriate, wouldn't you say, John Michael? I was in 4H but it was actually on an organic farm my wife and I were working. <br><br>A powerfully active pile, I built it starting with a base of cornstalks for air circulation. Then layers of rotting veggies from a market, well chopped leaves, and Lama manure and bedding straw. Any round pellet manure, like rabbit or lama, is excellent for compost or even direct bedding in a garden. Each layer was top dressed with a nice thick sheet of woodland humus. I had been reading up on compost starters, which are expensive buckets of compost containing microbes. I thought it sounded silly, considering the vast reserves of bio-herds in the surrounding woods. Each layer was watered in with the secret ingredient and biological "match" to get the Green Fire lite. Pond scum. We threw roped buckets into our pond, dredging in water, duck weed, and bottom muck. Built the whole thing like a cake. (I have always approached composting like baking, and the analogy is VERY apt!) This was a huge pile. 5x8x8, as we had access to a lot of rotten veggies from a market. Once it was built is heated up fast! I took it's temp every few days and started turning on the third. Got finished compost in 14 days! I was only in my early 20's fresh on an organic farm, but had grown up passive composting. I remember being very proud, especially when the experienced farmers came visited just to see the working pile. By the time we got the first one finished, we had another going! <br><br>All that was over 14 years ago. These days we are passive composters. Six pallet bins. Three on one side for ingredients, three on the other. "Feed Me", "Cooking", &amp; "Done" respectively. We dump in kitchen scraps, along with all the other things you are not supposed to compost. The occasional varmint gets buried in there as well. Each time a five gallon bucket of compost goes in, we add 2 to 3 times as much chopped leaves. In the fall, loads of manure and bedding (sometimes Elephant manure, it pays to have big friends!) gets mixed in. I also add some root free weeds, etc. By the late Autumn, the bin is filled to the top, 4x4x4 and we let it rot until next year, with a couple of turnings. By late spring, we have a finished yard or so of compost. <br><br>As best I know, our bins are the only composting area in our county with a Latin Motto. "Omnia Mors Aequat", roughly, Death Makes Us All Equal. <br><br>I don't seem to be able to post a link to a picture. <br><br>Sadly, we recently had a huge rat snake get killed in a rat trap. In respect, I buried him at the bottom of the pile.

I once tried inoculating five gallons of coffee grounds with their oyster mushroom spawn. It sort of worked -- but I didn't do it properly the first time, I didn't get many mushrooms, and my wife became increasingly annoyed at the increasingly noxious-looking mess in her sewing room. It all went into the compost pile, I got no more oyster mushrooms out of the deal, and I haven't tried it since. Maybe next year.<br><br>Fungi Perfecti also offer fungal spawn that -- allegedly -- you can inoculate your garden mulch with. You might get edible mushrooms, and the mulch breaks down and releases nutrients to the soil. I tried this once, and didn't see much difference, but it was a limited experiment -- I might try it again later. Anyone else done deliberate mycocompostremediationizing?<br><br><a href=#c2335240654963828961 title="comment permalink">8/13/10, 3:01 PM</a><br><br>

Short on money, but long on time, I built a very pretty one with a machete and a sledgehammer. I cut a bundle of less-than-two-inch diameter trees, chopped them into roughly three or four foot segments, with the narrow ends hacked into points, pounded the points into the ground in the edge of the woods with the sledge, and then wove them together with the smaller, flexible branches I'd cut, til I had a large withy semicircle. I piled up the kitchen scraps, woodstove ashes, soiled coop bedding, and scrap cardboard there for a year, and then built another one next to it the following year to house the new heap while I hauled the old one out to the garden beds. Worked beautifully and didn't cost a dime. And the chickens love scratching around in it for goodies.<br><br>The best part is that it isn't toxic or permanent.
