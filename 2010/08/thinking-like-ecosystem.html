Last week’s post on composting had, as my more perceptive readers will probably have noted, more than one agenda. First on the list, obviously, was the straightforward goal of getting as many people as possible to start practicing one of the simplest and most useful skills in the green wizard repertoire, and getting plant nutrients out of the waste stream and into the soil in the process. Still, there’s more involved here than that sensible step.<br><br>Composting, as I mentioned in passing last week, is more than just a core technology for organic gardening. It’s also a template on which a much broader range of approaches to sustainability can be modeled – or, rather, need to be modeled. It’s crucial to keep this in mind, because quite a few people who are discussing sustainability these days, with the best intentions in the world, are doing so from within the presuppositions of our current, utterly unsustainable civilization, and getting thoroughly bollixed up by the resulting misperceptions.<br><br>Organic gardening tends to be particularly prone to this sort of confusion, because the way most people grow food crops in the industrial world today – sensible and reasonable as it seems to us – is perhaps the best example of sheer, rank, bullheaded ecological stupidity on record in the last couple of thousand years or so. To grow food crops in today’s world, do you draw on the dozens of readily available and sustainable sources of plant nutrients, which happen to be the sources that plants have evolved to assimilate most readily? Do you cooperate with the soil’s ecology, which has coevolved with plants to store, distribute, and dispense these same nutrients to plants? Do you even recognize that food plants, like every other living thing, are part of ecological communities, and thrive best when those communities receive the very modest resources they need to flourish?<br><br>Not a chance. No, you get your nutrients from nonrenewable sources, because that’s where you can get them in chemically pure and highly concentrated forms, even though plants don’t benefit from having them in those forms; you treat soil as though it was a sterile medium serving only to hold plants upright and provide a sponge to hold irrigation water and chemicals, and then do your best to <i>make</i> it a sterile medium; you use chemical poisons to stomp the crap out of any attempt by any other living thing to help form an ecosystem involving your plants; and then you wonder why you’re stuck in a perpetual uphill battle against declining soil fertility, chemical-resistant weeds and bugs, water supplies poisoned with chemical runoff, and all the rest of it. If some evil genius had set out to invent an agricultural system that was guaranteed to self-destruct as messily as possible, I’m not sure he could have done a better job.<br><br>Still, because these are the customs we’ve all grown up with, the ways of thinking fostered by this sort of giddy ecological idiocy seem like common sense to most people. Recent discussions about “peak phosphorus” are a case in point. Our current agriculture relies on mineral phosphates, which are mined from a small number of highly concentrated phosphate rock deposits that located in odd corners of the world and are being depleted at a rapid pace. (Does this sound familiar?) The conclusion too often drawn from this is that the world faces mass starvation in the near future, because you can’t grow food crops without phosphate for fertilizer, and where will we get the phosphate?<br><br>There’s a point to these worries, since our current agricultural system is probably incapable of churning out food at anything like its current pace without those rapidly depleting mineral inputs, and even the very rapid expansion of organic farming under way in North America and elsewhere probably won’t be fast enough to prevent shortfalls. Still, it has too often been generalized into a claim that the exhaustion of rock phosphate reserves means inevitable mass famine, and this is true only to the extent that current notions of industrial agriculture remain welded into place and nobody gets to work building the next agriculture in the interstices of the present system.<br><br>It may already have occurred to my readers, after all, and has certainly occurred to me, that somehow plants grew all over the world’s land surfaces in vast abundance for something like three quarters of a billion years without any phosphate fertilizer at all. If this suggests that there’s something wrong with the logic that insists that we can’t grow plants without chemicals, it should. Nor are food crops somehow uniquely dependent on stuff out of test tubes. As proof of this, I’d like to invite you to visit a city that doesn’t exist any more, the bustling metropolis of Edo.<br><br>It’s called Tokyo nowadays, and there’s very little left of the city that was there a century and a half ago, but in the Tokugawa era – from 1603 to 1867 – Edo, then Japan’s real though unofficial capitol, had a population that varied between one and one and a half million people. Two other cities – Kyoto, the official capitol, and Osaka, the economic hub of the nation – had populations pushing a million each. Even by modern standards, then, these were cities of considerable size, and they were supported by organic intensive rice agriculture that used no chemical inputs at all. The inputs it used were human and animal manure, nitrogen extracted from the air by a common and deliberately cultivated species of duckweed, and a great deal of human labor, and its outputs kept levels of nutrition in Tokugawa Japan at levels comparable to those of European nations of the same time.<br><br>Without phosphate rock, why didn’t the Tokugawa-era Japanese all starve to death? Because ours is very nearly the only agricultural system in human history that has ever approached farming with the same sort of logic that governs a factory: energy and raw materials in one end, products and waste out the other, with no thought as to the long-term availability of the first two or the long-term effects of the last. Everywhere else in the world, farmers have known for time out of mind that life moves in circles, and that you have to feed the soil if you want the soil to feed you, and that proper husbandry pays off in richer soil and better yields even when you don’t have access to outside nutrient streams.<br><br>Thus in natural ecosystems, in 17th-century Japan, and in any other viable ecology, human or otherwise, the phosphorus used to grow plants doesn’t move in a straight line from phosphate mine to factory to farm to river to dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. It moves in a circle, from producer to consumer to decomposer and back again. That’s true when the producer is grass, the consumer is a rabbit, and the decomposers are soil organisms that process the rabbit’s droppings; it’s equally true when the producer is a rice paddy, the consumer is a medieval Japanese farmer or samurai, and the decomposers are a different set of microorganisms. Finally, it’s just as true when the producers are your garden plants, the consumer is you, and the decomposers are in your compost pile.<br><br>In each case, the result is the same: a relatively small addition of nutrients from outside sources goes a much longer way in a system that works according to ecological processes, because the ecosystem recycles the nutrients back into the plants instead of letting them go into the waste stream. The more efficiently you keep things circling, the less you need to add from outside the system. If you can learn to think like an ecosystem, this will become as obvious as the need for vast amounts of concentrated mineral inputs seems to so many people today.<br><br>At the same time, out there in the real world, there are always inputs from outside the system, just as there are always flows out of the system into other systems, and you can learn to take advantage of those inputs. All through your topsoil and down a short distance into the subsoil, for example, humic acids – complex natural compounds produced by decaying organic matter – silently dissolve nutrients in rock particles and make them available to soil organisms and plants. The nutrient inputs that come via this route are usually fairly small, but they add up over time, and their effectiveness depends on a thriving soil ecosystem and enough organic matter in the soil to produce the humic acids.<br><br>The duckweed in rice paddies mentioned a few paragraphs back is an example of an even more crucial source of inputs. Nitrogen is a nutrient that doesn’t normally occur in soils in anything like useful quantities; fortunately there’s this big reservoir of it, right next to your soil, called the atmosphere. Various microbes spread out along the shifting taxonomic borderline between fungi and bacteria can process nitrogen from the air into nitrates and other forms that plants can use, and quite a few plants have evolved the trick of feeding and fostering those microbes so that the soil where they grow ends up full of useful nitrogen. Putting that process to work for you is one of the fastest ways to make an organic garden thrive. Unless you’re setting up rice paddies and shopping for duckweed, the plants you want to use for nitrogen fixation are legumes: peas, beans, and their relatives, which not coincidentally are a major source of protein and other nutrients your body needs.<br><br>Now of course most of us have yet another source of inputs, and it’s the one we talked about setting up last week. Even if you’ve got a thriving organic garden in your back yard, you’re almost certainly getting at least some of your food from other sources, and if you’re in the very first stages of setting up that soon-to-be-thriving organic garden, you’re getting all your food from other sources. The scraps and trimmings that go into your compost bin are therefore nutrient inputs to your garden. If you’re raking up autumn leaves and adding them in, or mowing your lawn, letting the trimmings dry out a bit, and putting them into your compost, that’s another input. This is the secret function of your compost bin: it’s a tool for concentrating nutrients from a wider area into the piece of ground you garden.<br><br>More broadly, that’s one of the secrets of successful organic gardening: you close up your nutrient cycles as tightly as possible, but you also tap into other nutrient streams that would otherwise become waste, and draw them into the eager clutches of your garden’s ecology. Traditional farming methods around the world turned this sort of thing into a fine art, weaving farms and gardens into the wider ecology of the area in richly complex ways. All this needs to be done in ways that don’t impair the viability of the systems that provide inputs to your garden, but that can be done easily enough in most cases, given a bit of finesse and a sensitivity to ecological relationships.<br><br>Your options here are very broad, and will depend on local conditions. Still, here are three common approaches to add to what you can get via the compost bin.<br><br>The first method is mulching. In many parts of North America, this has become a staple technique of organic gardeners, and for good reason; in other places, for equally good reasons, nobody does it. You get large quantities of coarse and otherwise unwanted organic material – for example, spoiled hay, autumn leaves, straw, or crushed peanut hulls – and spread a layer several inches thick over your garden beds before planting; when you plant, clear away the mulch around the seedling or the seed so it can get sunlight. The layer of mulch helps suppress weeds, keeps moisture in the soil, and gradually rots, adding nutrients to your soil.<br><br>Drawbacks? When I lived in the rainy part of the Pacific Northwest, nobody in their right mind mulched during the growing season, because mulch in damp climates is a slug magnet, and slugs in the wet zone west of the Cascades can get up to eight inches long, with appetites to match. I’ve heard from a few gardeners who had similar troubles with rats. Of course you also have to find a source of clean organic matter in bulk, and this can be a challenge in some situations.<br><br>The second method is green manure. This amounts to a living mulch for the winter season: something fast-growing that you can sow in your garden beds when the weather starts to cool off, and hoe under in the spring just before planting. The best green manures for small garden use in many cases are clovers, which are legumes and put nitrogen in your soil, and rye grass, which produces a lot of organic matter relatively quickly and breaks down easily in the soil to feed the organisms there. If you mulch, you won’t be able to use green manure, and vice versa; both are good approaches, and it’s probably worth your while to try them both on different patches of ground to see what works best in your area.<br><br>The third method is the tried and true trick of growing an abundance of legumes in your garden. Done right, anywhere in the temperate zone, this is a three-step process: you plant peas as early in spring as you can work the soil; you plant beans as soon as the weather is warm enough for them, and then you plant a second round of peas for fall harvest about the time the summer peaks and begins to decline into autumn. Any kind of pea or bean will do, so choose whatever kinds you like to eat, and plant as many as space permits; if you grow the kind that are eaten green, you can always blanch and freeze anything you can’t eat in season, and if you grow the kind that are dried and shelled, an extra pound or two of dried beans or peas in the root cellar is always a good thing to have.<br><br>There are many other ways to work the same transfer of nutrients. It’s important not to become too dependent on any source of outside nutrients that could be shut off unexpectedly – say, by problems with the economy – and it’s even more important to make sure that the inputs that you use are the sort of thing that will support the ecology of your garden rather than damaging it, as chemical fertilizers will. Within those limits, there are plenty of options; see what you can come up with.<br><br><span style=font-size:130%>Resources</span><br><br>The three methods discussed in this post vary widely in ease of information access. You can find plenty of information about growing peas and beans in any decent book on organic gardening, while green manuring is not that common in the organic field just now, for some reason, and I don’t know of a good book that covers it in any detail; my knowledge is partly a matter of experience and partly brief discussions in some of those same decent books on organic gardening, in particular John Seymour’s <i>The Self-Sufficient Gardener</i>. (If any of my readers know of a book specifically about this technique, suitable for home gardeners, I’d welcome the information.)<br><br>Mulching is another matter, not least because the organic gardening world has been through at least one round of pre-internet flame wars between pro-mulching and anti-mulching factions. The classic books here are by Ruth Stout, <i>How to Have a Green Thumb without an Aching Back</i>, and Ruth Stout and Richard Clemence, <i>The Ruth Stout No-Work Garden Book</i>. Those interested in all the fine details might also look for Robert Rodale et al., <i>The Organic Way to Mulching</i>.<br><br>**************<br><br>A tip of the wizard's hat to reader Liz Brugman, who took the time to convert all of the Master Conserver handouts into individual searchable PDF files. The first five are available on the <a href=http://www.culturalconservers.org/library.php>Cultural Conservers</a> website, and the rest will be following shortly.

For quite a while I thought it must be my understanding that was wrong, in my childish naivete I still thought the adults must have everything under control.

The soil is used simply for holding up the plants so they can be sprayed with chemicals by ground and air. Very strange. A local newspaper story told how test wells in our county revealed that ground water has receded two feet in one year. Comments from a local farmer were, "I hope the water holds out for my lifetime".<br><br>This is some of the most fertile ground in our nation and virtually no one grows food that their family actually eats. I love to share my extra vegetables and fruit with folks in town and the comments of "Where did you get these peaches?" and "How did you grow these melons?" amazes me. The people have forgotten to grow real food. All the corn, wheat and cotton go 'somewhere else' or to the dairy or feedlot up the road. In my local women's service group I was telling them how useful earthworms are and only ONE of these farmers' wives even knew they were a beneficial creature. We have a long way to go in re-education!<br><br><a href=#c2451108081820430798 title="comment permalink">8/11/10, 9:20 PM</a><br><br>

Both these things being cute in their childish form, but disturbing that children are familiar with industrial production more than natural forces.<br><br>On the teaching side, I recently watched a Japanese children's cooking show, which was as bizarre and foreign as you might imagine for an American viewer: Hello Kitty, dancing, songs, anime interludes, bright colors, the chef playing the roles of pop star or magical girl, that sort of thing. But amongst this entertainment was some very solid information. As the hostess prepared her food, the camera flashed back to previous scenes of her picking the vegetables out of the ground and planting the rice by hand, while her voiceover reminded viewers what she had needed to do at each turn of the way. The obvious message that having a process to produce the ingredients was as important (or much more so) than putting them together into a dish. How easy it is to convey this information, and yet has any American television show thought of trying it?<br><br><a href=#c1628942481321285253 title="comment permalink">8/11/10, 9:48 PM</a><br><br>

They are also allowed into the garden for about two weeks each year to dig for slug eggs that got past them. And, of course, when their barn is mucked out, that goes to the garden as well. The water that's changed out from the duck ponds irrigates and fertilizes the fruit trees, which are mulched as well (with trunks fenced off from marauding chickens).

The core of what you are saying is that you are providing food and habitat to an entire ecosystem that operates above and below the ground. This ecosystem will also provide food for yourself as a by product. In addition, having food produced from a biodiverse ecosystem will insulate you somewhat from the shocks that occur in ecosystems on a regular basis. Also plants have evolved to recycle nutrients in a way that is beneficial for their future and their offspring. They've achieved what we haven't even come close to.<br><br>This is a difficult concept for farmers to grasp, especially as you quite rightly also point out that they are heavily invested in an industrial mono culture agricultural model. This translates to inputs - production - outputs + waste. A good example is a cattle feed lot in that they don't see the waste being produced as a source of inputs for the next cycle.<br><br>Here in Australia, organic methods of agriculture are still very much on the fringe. <br><br>I no longer mention my production methods in conversation with farmers around here because they simply ridicule them. However, I will state that the depth of top soil that I have is getting deeper every year and I share a significant portion of my production with the wildlife here and they hang around the food forest in preference to the natural forest. They also provide me with ready fertiliser which they kindly spread around the site (via their poo) without effort on my part. <br><br>It might surprise people to understand that I rarely water my orchard and have several hundred diverse trees which are doing quite well. Water is the key to survival here and the deeper and more active the top soil, the more water will be held in the ground for the benefit of the plants.<br><br>Time will tell in relation to a society wide transition to organic farming methods. My personal belief is that it won't occur in any large way until the price (or supply) of oil reaches a significant amount which will then equate to higher food prices. It will be a necessity thing rather than a conscious thing. The sad thing is that it takes a couple of years to transition across to a diverse ecosystem, especially in very degraded soil (ie. most of Australia) and will result in a lot of pain if handled poorly. You simply can't build up an ecosystem over night. <br><br>However, it is an accelerating system in that the longer it is applied and the more inputs are given, the healthier and more diverse the ecosystem and outputs. Very inspirational!<br><br>PS: I have read that Japanese farmers used to provide public toilets on highways to collect the human outputs of people travelling through their area. What a great idea to increase your available inputs with little effort on your part.<br><br>PPS: Mulching can be done on broad acre farms by letting the weeds run amok for a year or so and then slashing them back (and letting them lie on the soil) as a mulch. Cheap, effective and simple. If you have weeds then you have some sort of imbalance that the weeds are taking advantage of.

The conversion of vast expanses of the surface of the earth into sterile culture medium is especially horrifying to me. Most of the biodiversity in most ecosystems is in all those little things down in the soil you never see -- ecologists call soil the "poor man's tropical rainforest" (i.e. if you don't have the funding to fly to Costa Rica, just put a cubic centimeter of dirt from your garden under a microscope). The idea of eradicating this on a massive scale (PERFECTLY LEGALLY!!) was downright genocidal to me. <br><br>For those of you who have never been through the ordeal of doctoral qualifying exams, you have an examining committee of 4 or 5 faculty members, and each one has you for a day. He or she gives you a set of questions, and you spend the entire day answering them. It's a comprehensive final exam that lasts for 20-40 hours. One of my committee members always gave the same question: "Here are a bunch of statistics on economics, climate, biology, soils, etc. etc. for region X. Design an economic system for this region that will be sustainable indefinitely with the minimum possible imports and exports." Of course there was no right answer, he just wanted to see your ability to synthesize information and "think like an ecosystem." While I was working through the question, two things kept on jumping out at me as glaringly obvious. First, there could be no such thing as "waste." All byproducts of everything had to be retained within ecological and economic cycles -- including all human waste and other animal waste. Second, from an ecological perspective, concentrated urban areas produce NOTHING. Sure they have vital economic and societal functions, but from an ecological point of view all they did was take lots of high-quality resources in and spew a lot of low-quality "waste" out. Of course, there could be no waste, so all this effluent from the cities had to be captured and redispersed through the landscape somehow. The energy necessary to do his would put a natural limit on the size of these urban areas, and set what the "urban/rural" population ratio needed to be.<br><br><a href=#c5303254494394352367 title="comment permalink">8/12/10, 6:11 AM</a><br><br>

No ecosystem is perfectly tight, there is always a slow leak out the bottom. This slow leak just needs to be about the same as the slow rate of release from natural soil and bedrock minerals, on a large scale. This is all happening at a geological time scale; one of the advantages of having lived a half a century or more, though, is that you realize that geological processes actually DO happen fast enough for you to perceive and work with them during a single human lifetime!<br><br>The concentration of nutrients from a large area into a small food-producing area to me is one of the most important ideas in creating long-term sustainable agriculture. If you can focus those slow geological processes into a smaller plot you can create local hot spots of high productivity without draining the landscape. This is one of the most important basic concepts that permaculture has assimilated by the way (but don't think for a second that they invented the idea -- anyone who has ever mucked a garden with stable manure from grazing livestock or raked up the autumn leaves and put them in the compost bin has done the same thing). The same thing happens in nature on a large scale in places like estuaries, where even before humans were messing things up all those slow leaks from the upstream world accumulate and combine with tidal energy to fuel extremely productive ecosystems. On a smaller scale it happens in creek and river bottoms where the downhill movement of water and materials concentrates nutrients and fertility in rich productive ecosytems. No accident that the first places cleared for farming in much of eastern North America were the bottomlands.<br><br><a href=#c7879630425848030961 title="comment permalink">8/12/10, 6:12 AM</a><br><br>

Prairie soils were "fertile" because theur semiarid climate and moderately slow decomposition meant that they had huge reserves of soil organic matter that was full of nitrogen and retained tons of other mineral nutrients. So when you break the sod, sitr up the soil, and in some cases start irrigating, you get a huge release on nutrients and enormous crop yields - for a while. Then you deplete the reserves, the pulse passes, and you start applying external fertilizers. Same thing with these desert soils that are so "fertile" when irrigated. Thanks to the lack of rainfall, all their phosphorus is still in the soil, not having been washed away. So dump on some water and some ammonium nitrate and *boom* fantastic plant growth -- for a while. Soon enough all sorts of things go wrong, and you wind up with the same sterile culture medium dependent on external fertilizers. <br><br>Our notions of a "fertile soil" need to be retooled from those of the westward expansion and industrial agriculture boom eras.<br><br><a href=#c321312525419412624 title="comment permalink">8/12/10, 6:21 AM</a><br><br>

Some of them fix nitrogen. Then they winterkill and create mulch. Green manures, on the other hand, are tilled into the soil, and tilling, according to Reich, destroys soil structure and burns up organic matter too quickly by injecting oxygen into the soil.<br><br>Reich gardens in the Northeast, and so do I, so I don't know how this would work in other climates.

Many thanks for the additional details -- and particularly for the stress on the redefinition of fertility, which is a crucial point. I'm not sure how to frame the redefinition, but the point that I think needs to be grasped is that fertility is a moving target -- soil isn't fertile or infertile in the abstract; it's always in process, gaining or losing nutrients and tilth, and participation in that process is much more important than where you are at any given moment. <br><br>Kirk, exactly. If we ran society as the ecosystem it is, there would be peaks, but they'd be as rhythmic and repeated as waves or seasons: various flows would increase and decrease, always in balance, always maintaining conditions so that the whole system maintains its climax community in undisturbed zones and moves regularly through seres in disturbed ones.

That's one of the reasons to make sure you have plenty of legume crops if you use mulch, so there's still enough nitrogen to go around. Urine is another good source of extra nitrates, of course.<br><br>Paul, you can certainly use a more complex composter if rats trouble you. Still, I'm a bit startled by your suggestion that rats are more closely related to human beings than chimpanzees are. I don't believe that's the case. Perhaps you'd care to offer a source. <br><br>Adrian, I don't use rotation in the usual way; instead, I intercrop -- all the different vegetables are mingled in with one another, rather than being in separate beds -- and shift locations within that pattern.

He claims that, according to research his organization has done, they get much richer soil from growing "compost crops." The idea is that rather than tilling plants into the soil to rot, where they may temporarily lock up whatever carbon or nitrogen is present (thereby depriving the plants you're trying to grow), you instead grow plants that develop a lot of biomass quickly, harvest those, and deposit them into the compost pile where they'll be composted much more thoroughly and efficiently than in your garden soil.<br><br>I've tried to run my farm on an ecological model, but it's not without its challenges. Rather than buying chicken bedding from the farm store, I get sawdust from a local sawmill. I'm aware, though, that it could close down someday. That would leave me relying on dried leaves, which I've done before, but that's something that has to be gathered once a year and stored. Otherwise, I have to let the grass grow long and use the trimmings.<br><br>These alternatives also require balances. The fastest way I know to gather leaves is to suck them all up with a vacuum mulcher, compress them into plastic bags, and store them in a loft. But the mulcher requires a great deal of electricity (or rather, the fuel used to generate it). If I do it by hand, which takes a lot longer, I use many more bags. Investing more time means I have to make up lost income, which I can do by raking other people's leaves for a fee, but that means driving, and if I'm using more bags, that means more trips. Then, of course, I have limited space to store the full bags, pressuring me to use the mulcher or use less bedding or raise fewer chickens or build more storage space.<br><br>Feed has been another issue. I don't presently have land to grow feed for all my chickens, so I thought to use wastes from a large bakery nearby. Before I made any such arrangements, though, I was approached by a feed salesman offering GMO-free feed made from locally-grown grains. This feed mill, though, is about 100 miles away, whereas the bakery is about 6 miles. Each has arguments favoring it as the "greener" option, but both are vulnerable to going out of business.<br><br>Trying to make my farm as resilient and self-sustaining as possible while balancing all these competing concerns is leading me to the reluctant realization that the best strategy is to focus on producing food and fuel for my own family, while producing goods for sale takes a back seat.<br><br><a href=#c4945931701495418726 title="comment permalink">8/12/10, 11:34 AM</a><br><br>

The N doesn't go anywhere, and as the mulch continues to decompose it is released again. If you leave the old mulch to rot in place while applying new mulch on top (basically in situ composting), on balance there's no net loss from the soil. It can be a short-term thing though, like if you dump a bunch of wheat straw or wood chips on rapidly growing young corn, you can see an immediate negative response in the corn plants. So don't do that! But for an overwinter mulch, or early season before planting, go for it! By the time the plant roots need the nitrogen the mulch should have mellowed enough that it'll be no problem. Also fine to keep topping up existing mulches with a little fresh straw etc. that will gradually compost its way on down. You can also use it as a layer interbedded with N-rich materials like manure, especially if you are doing the whole sheet-mulch thing. <br><br>Rainfall in most of the northern hemisphere has a fair amount of N contamination in it from car exhaust etc. This N in the rainfall will be grabbed by your fresh mulch and help work its C:N ratio down. It's even possible that in the long run a high carbon mulch might increase the total N in your system by encouraging free-living nitrogen-fixing microbes to colonize it and start taking N out of the air. I haven't seen the latest research, but back in my active days there were several studies that looked at the rate on N accumulation in initially barren systems (like fresh volcanic mudflows, or a giant experimental sandbox) and found it was about twice as high as could be accounted for by measured sources. It seemed that the free-living N fixers might have a way of kicking in under circumstances when N is in short supply, at least when you give them a chance to.<br><br><a href=#c3701332446078370367 title="comment permalink">8/12/10, 12:07 PM</a><br><br>

H. King. <br><br>It is undeniable that conventional agricultural practices have done everything possible to speed up soil degradation through mining, erosion, salinization and many other unholy practices. But soils naturally undergo a degradation process and are not blessed equally when it comes to inherent fertility. <br><br>Over time, soils will loose phosphorus, either by leaching, preferential flow (movement in the network of soil macropores) and also fixation in chemical forms which are for all purpose extremily stable and that the plants cant get at. If one is blessed with a young soil not too far along the weathering process, there is enough phosphorus to support lots of biomass(I am passing the details on how tropical forests get away with thriving on very poor soils by storing P in the vegetation). But with some soils which are really deficient in P, its addition from outside sources is mandatory to obtain any kind of yields and the cheapest and most efficient way to do it is often with chemical fertilizers. Not everybody has access to the large quantities of organic wastes it takes to build up the fertility of a depleted soil. It is the same for other nutrients such as K, Ca, Mg...Japanese recycled considerable amounts of fish wastes and seaweeds to bump up the fertility of their soils. Native South Americans appear to have done the same with Terra Preta soils. My advice would be, recycle all you can but have your soil tested and correct nutritional deficiencies while you have access to relatively cheap sources of P, K, Mg, Ca etc...On our farm we do recycle bones because we have large piles of manure we allow to compost for two years. But I am not sure it would fly very well in an urban environment. <br><br>Also, the best choice to fix nitrogen in the vegetable garden is the broad bean (Vicia faba). Peas and beans do poorly in comparison.<br><br><a href=#c8373014342697817940 title="comment permalink">8/12/10, 1:17 PM</a><br><br>

The harshness in the passage was deliberate, though not aimed at any one individual. <br><br>Marielar, thanks for the info! One thing, though: a fair number of people can't eat fava beans without getting ill from them -- it's a genetic problem, common to Mediterranean peoples but not limited to them. As for their superior nitrogen fixing ability, well, all I can say is I've never had a problem with too little nitrogen when using compost and other legumes. <br><br>Katsmama, granted, the public schools these days are still stuck on a notion of the future that has nothing to do with reality -- when, that is, they're not just teaching to government-mandated tests. My guess is that homeschoolers and private schools will have to lead the way here. <br><br>Cathy, the situation in Tokugawa Japan was a lot more nuanced than you've suggested. Like all complex human societies, Japan at that time was profoundly hierarchical; unlike most modern societies, they didn't see any point in pretending otherwise. That said, a spectrum consists of something other than its two ends, and there was a vast middle ground -- including a lot of farmers -- between the abstract categories of "overlords" and "peasants." <br><br>Interestingly, the place of farmers in the formal hierarchy was just below samurai, and above craftspeople and merchants; it was entirely acceptable for samurai to farm, while they couldn't get into trade without losing their status. Of course the formal hierarchy wasn't always an accurate measure of power; a rich Osaka rice merchant might have more actual power, and certainly had more wealth, than many nobles, and there were some very poor and downtrodden farmers in the provinces, but it's important not to map a simplistic model (of the sort very common these days) onto the very complex reality of that time. Or any other, including this one. <br><br>As for rice, one thing people in societies with abundant fossil fuels forget is that when everybody does a great deal of hard physical activity every day, and central heating doesn't exist, the most important part of the diet is its caloric content, and you get most of that from carbohydrates. Everybody in medieval Japan ate a lot of rice, because that was the most readily available source of calories. <br><br>Everyone supplemented their rice with other foodstuffs, depending on income level and social class; Japanese peasant cooking, like peasant cuisines from around the world, does a great deal with readily accessible vegetables and cheap local proteins, while the daimyo (nobility) and those Osaka rice merchants ate some very fancy stuff. Still, rice was the basic staple; we'll talk soon about the importance of bulk grains and dried legumes, and the differences between the farming that produces those and the gardening that, in societies without fossil fuels, produces much of the rest. <br><br>Mel, check with your local herbalist. If smooth bedstraw has the same medicinal properties as other members of the same family, you may be able to find a market for it. I knew of farmers in Oregon who had bad problems with Klamath weed until they found out it's also called St. John's wort, and made arrangement for herbalists to come collect it by the pickup load for free.<br><br><a href=#c4929698908506624934 title="comment permalink">8/12/10, 6:57 PM</a><br><br>

We've discovered what others have noted: fresh leaf mulch will inhibit nitrogen in the short run, so we are letting the stuff mellow out longer in separate leaf bins, where we shovel it back and forth between bins to aerate and cook if as fast as possible.<br><br>We recently planted a bunch of comfrey in some marginal soil to be green manure for next year. From time to time we add bone meal to our tomato plants to provide the phosphorus they need to maximize fruit production. I'm with Jim Brewster; if there is a massive die-off when our industrialized society collapses, there should be more than enough bone meal lying around in all those human skeletons...<br><br>A few years ago when we still lived in the suburbs of Chicago, we were the first in our neighborhood to start gardening in both front and back yards. In the fall we would gather up the big yard bags full of fallen leaves and put them in the bins in our back yard to cook down for mulch. Otherwise, the leaves would have been collected by the sanitation or public works departments and taken to a dump or landfill or somewhere "away." <br><br>The same thing happened with the grass clippings in the summer time, although we discovered that we had to be more careful about the grass. It all depended on the chemicals (fertilizers and pesticides and weed-killing herbicides) that the individual homeowners used on their lawns. <br><br>I was amazed that otherwise intelligent heighbors would buy bags of fertilizer to grow their lawns, then cut the grass and get rid of the clippings in big plastic bags... Basically we could get as much organic material as we could haul off for free, thanks to all of our neighbors who were perfectly happy to be rid of it...<br><br>So, it occurs to me that a hundred years or so in the future we may see raiding parties from neighboring villages trying to carry off each others' fallen leaves, grass clippings, manure piles, and other organic materials, to take home to mulch their own gardens. Anything to maximize the amount of imported materials to keep their own food supply growing...<br><br><a href=#c6334086687630001667 title="comment permalink">8/12/10, 11:34 PM</a><br><br>

I had a small place and when I moved in, the yard was over-run with slugs. I'd water around sunset and then go out an hour later with my flashlight (now I'd use my solar one) with a spray bottle with ammonia and water (something about it being better for the soil then salt...). Putting down a board or cardboard concentrated the slugs. <br><br>The first year it was every night, the second every 3 nights or so and then once a week. <br><br>Many people moan about how invasive running bamboo is. I had a little clump. I wanted it to expand. I just shoveled little rows of horse manure where I wanted it to run. The bamboo I had only sprouted for 2 or 3 weeks a year. A shoot, when cut, would not re-sprout. Good eating, too. So that running invasive bamboo? Not a problem as long as I rode heard on it for a short period of time every year.

Vetch is sold here as a green manure crop. Very good it is too.<br><br>At this point it might be worth mentioning that the concept of "weed" is a human construct. I'd like to use the word pioneering plant rather than weed.<br><br>People around these parts think that blackberries, bracken, pittosporum undulatum etc are weeds. I'd like to say that if they were truly weeds in the commonly used sense of the word, then they'd have taken over the face of the planet. They haven't quite achieved this yet. On the other hand, people miss all of the very large eucalyptus obliqua trees which can also be rightly described with the same qualities of a weed. Seems a bit selective to me.<br><br>I'd recommend that you try an experiment with your vetch and see how it goes over a season or two. Give it a chance to go to seed and then immediately mow it all and leave the mulched remains spread evenly over the surface of the soil. See what happens then. It won't look like a manicured lawn though! Try clearing a small space in the mulch and growing some seedlings. Old growth forests work in this manner (minus the mowing of course!) and they certainly don't require phosphates brought in from around the globe.<br><br>I tend to look at "weeds" as part of the biodiversity of the ecosystem. On my block, they are encouraged and given a chance. They haven't taken over the place yet. <br><br>I hope I'm not going to get burned at the stake for being a heretic.<br><br>If they are taking over then it is probably an indicator that something else is very wrong with your ecosystem.<br><br>To Bill Pulliam: I've read recently that it took 15 years to exhaust the soils in Australia's native grass lands of their natural fertility and biodiversity once we introduced hard hoofed cattle and particularly sheep. All of Australia's native animals are soft footed and as such do little damage to the soil and water systems. We've really created environmental problems for ourselves here through our own lack of understanding of the ecosystem. The last thing that the people who brought those non native animals in to Australia thought about was about damage to the ecosystem. Sad really.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><a href=#c4904024875182533441 title="comment permalink">8/13/10, 2:26 AM</a><br><br>

This agricultural charcoal is a soil amendment that allows the soil to better hold on to nutrients and moisture.

We can do this on a very large scale ("reverse carbon mining", "carbon re-fossilization") and fix the atmosphere.

They make the distinction between technical nutrients and biological nutrients. Kept separate, they can be endlessly cycled—technical nutrients in industry, and biological nutrients in the natural ecosystem.<br><br>Because our modern society has lost sight of these fundamentals, we have created “monstrous hybrids.” An example would be your average sneaker. The leather is no longer tanned with natural tannins. Nowadays they use heavy metals. And unless you separate the two, the hybrid is useless to both cycles. It’s not easy for industry to recapture the heavy metals in the leather, and of course, you would never throw sneaker leather in your compost pile (I’m not sure if it would even decompose) but you could put leather made with natural tannins in there.<br><br>As for green manure, Edward Faulkner discusses the concept well in ‘Ploughman’s Folly,’ as does Albert Howard (one of the founding fathers of organic farming along with F.H.

Do you happen to know if there are seasonal patterns in the anomalous N accumulation?"<br><br>I don't think the sampling was often enough or the changes rapid enough to resolve seasonal patterns. I believe one of the studies was a chronosequence of mudslides on Mt. Shasta of different ages. I do know that the ecosystem simulation model I worked with for many years was not able to replicate these sorts of experiments unless you arbitrarily cranked up some N input beyond what was generally measured. Free-living (non-symbiotic) N fixation was just a prime suspect; it is very hard to measure directly as the world is full of N2, NO2, NO3, and NH4 at any given instant so finding a small flux amidst the heavy traffic can be quite a challenge. I did a little googling and did not find any specific recent research, but that does not mean there isn't any out there. I wonder if there is a stable isotope signature for biological nitrogen fixation? <br><br>Anyway, like so many other things in nature, when an ecosystem is short on available N there is SOMETHING that has evolved to exploit the less available forms (like N2) that will kick in. Potentially N-fixing cyanobacteria are everywhere, all the time (even on the surface of the monitor you are reading this on), and there are many other taxa that can do the trick under various conditions of light or dark, O2 or no O2, etc. Something just has to turn on the enzymes. <br><br>Now, this won't grow your cabbages this winter; but it might help you manage your soil over the next decade and century.<br><br><a href=#c8985050907995543097 title="comment permalink">8/13/10, 1:58 PM</a><br><br>

Most simply, it is organic matter -- which means anything you would compost -- applied directly on garden beds, or used as the foundation for a new garden bed. When starting a new bed, waste cardboard or newspapers are widely used (industrial waste stream) to suppress any existing plants, which rot after dying, in turn creating fertility. A less dependent method is to use bulk carbonaceous matter such as dry leaves, straw, hay, large leaves (burdock), pine branches or hugulkulture, which is the piling of rotting sticks, logs, or tree/shrub trimmings to suppress existing plant growth. On top of your "weed barrier" you apply any bulk organic matter available, including unfinished compost, and let it rot for a season, or create small "compost pockets" to plant seedlings into.<br><br>Secondly, planting hardy and fast growing leguminous shrubs intermixed with your vegetable crops. As they grow, you simply chop and drop the growth onto the soil, which acts as mulch and breaks down into rich soil. When you prune these species of plants, the roots also prune themselves. As this happens, the nitrogen fixed from the atmosphere into little nodules (by our bacteria friends) breakdown alongside the roots and rootlets, creating a slow and steady release of nitrogen and organic matter. <br><br>Common wild plants of the N. American temperate climate (which produce seed that is readily available, even in cities) that fix nitrogen are Redbud,Honey locust, Black Locust, Bristly Locust, Wild Senna, and Blue False Indigo to name a few.<br><br><a href=#c898378304523119447 title="comment permalink">8/13/10, 3:17 PM</a><br><br>

Then I'll repeat with the other half of future pastures. It goes without saying I'd be spreading stall 'waste' on a regular cycle.<br> <br>One of the perks I'll add to the stable is an offer for boarders to grow a garden. From what I've seen many of the people in this area aren't into raised bed, intensive gardening and settle for a few feet of rows for some seasonal fresh food. So to encourage intensive gardening I'll put my first garden next to the two acres I intend to offer for garden plots. (If you don't have room for a horse you likely don't have room for a garden. Besides, if Mom or Dad is bored while the kid does horse up keep this is something for them to do in good weather!) There is also a perk for me in these extra gardens. They'll provide for more flowering plants for a hive or three of bees!<br> <br>This will also make it easy for me to build up a network of like minded people in the area. Think of it as a sneaky way to convert people to the support of Mother Earth while winnowing out those who have a completely mechanical mindset!<br><br><a href=#c601999150807811360 title="comment permalink">8/13/10, 10:39 PM</a><br><br>

If you can find a good local library, see if they have books on what the First Nations in the area did with local plants; that may give you some clues. <br><br>Ric, I rather liked the way Matt Savinar summarized one of my posts: "The collapse is here, but it's not widely distributed yet." As for antibiotics, the writing's been on the wall there for two decades now. Time spent looking up older ways of fighting infectious diseases will not be wasted. <br><br>Greatblue, I'll see if I can find a copy of that book to look over. Edward Kormondy, who was involved in it, is worth reading; he wrote a nice little book, <i>Concepts of Ecology</i>, which might make a good alternate for <i>Basic Ecology</i>. <br><br>Girl, sounds like a plan. <br><br>Adele, it can certainly work on a larger scale, but the backyard scale is the one I want to concentrate on just now. Thanks for the book recommendations!<br><br>Daughter, I'll be talking about this down the road a bit. Still, the short form for now is that there are toxins in everything, there's a balance to be struck between what we'd like to do and what we reasonably can do, and it's critical not to let the perfect become the enemy of the possible. If it's your own hair and that of your family and pets, by all means use it. <br><br>KL, I googled it and found one Facebook post making loud claims with no documentation, as well as a couple of dozen articles about unrelated bills at state legislatures. Always check your facts...<br><br>Don, nice!

As for the composting traditions of the past, the history of agriculture is a challenging subject scattered in specialist literature; you pretty much need to research each culture individually. A good cross-cultural history of composting would be a first-rate doctoral project for somebody. <br><br>Darius, no kidding. We have a lot of relearning to do before antibiotics fail completely, or we can expect to have to learn the hard way. <br><br>Cathy, yes, I saw that!

We'll be talking about the difference in the next post. <br><br>Walt, it's not every species of duckweed, it's a specific one used by Japanese and Chinese paddy rice farmers.

Here's a few points now. I wouldn't spend much money on compost bins. In the EU at least, a variety of commodities seem to be shipped around in plastic drums, volume about 220 litres. They have large necks and screw tops and here in SW England are re-sold from the farmers' co-ops for about £20. I use them for composting, but also as water butts and for making cider. The ones I use have previously shipped pickles or lemons or olives. You can cut the bottom off and use that as a trough. This reminds me that WATER is a vital resource in the garden. Despite having 50 inches a year here I still ended up with a dry garden in July. Industrial society again provides us with an amazing 'cast-off' - the IBC container. Anyone else use these? I bought a 1000 litre one, previously used for liquid soap, for £30. This will collect water from a shed roof. It's staggering that a container such as this is considered a waste product! <br>As winters here bring rain that hammers on my soil I have taken to trying to cover every inch of ground. I might use compost, mulch, newspapers or green manure. I started with a green manure of Italian ryegrass and red clover. Local organic farmers use it as a short-term ley. It is sown under a cereal crop and left to grow after cereal harvest. Then it is grazed by sheep or broiler chickens. The ryegrass will germinate late into September but the clover seems to like it warmer, and a firmer seedbed. I've found the clover very good this summer for attracting bees but have now moved to a smaller white clover and actually sow that under brassicas, leeks etc.. <br>The issue of continuous soil cover reminds me that the book 'One Straw Revolution' has been referenced here again. This is not so much a book as a series of rants. The principle being followed is that your system of agriculture should be appropriate for the location. The author spent many years perfecting his own system and came up with a continuous cover, no till approach. This does not mean that it is appropriate for where you or I live. He relied on a near 12 month growing season in order to rotate wheat/barley with rice, growing each successive crop under the straw of the previous. This system cannot be described as 'no-work'. (Have under ever tried harvesting cereals by hand?). His system for sowing rice involved pelleting it by hand in clay (to avoid it being eaten by sparrows)! Should someone recommend this system to you I suggest you ask whether this is what THEY do. If they say 'yes' then ask to visit their garden! The peak oil community seems somewhat divided into those that think that the skills we need can be found by googling at a computer and reading fashionable textbooks and those that think that our great grandparents had most of what we need. I'm pretty much in the second group. (OK, I know both have their merits). As I sit here I look out on to a farm that practises a continuous cover, no-till, low input system. It is known as 'permanent pasture' and supports lamb and beef. Parts of southern England (the chalk downlands) might have been under this syetm for 4000 years. It supports a diverse wildlife of plants, insects and birds. Sustainable?<br><br><a href=#c1282640244129140294 title="comment permalink">8/16/10, 1:03 AM</a><br><br>

She said that it was done by incredibly strict protocols, e.g., if your uniform brushed against anything that might be a source of infection, you left the ward, went back to your dorm, bagged everything you were wearing, took a full shower (scrubbing yourself down completely), put on fresh clothes and went back to work. <br><br>She also said the nurse:patient ratio was close to 1:1 back in those days. In the iron-lung wards it had to be 1:1 exactly, because the power could go out anytime. Whenever that happened, you had to work the iron lung's mechanical back-up system by taking hold of a lever and rocking your whole body back and forth, to work the machinery at a rhythm that suited your individual patient. If you didn't, your patient would die very soon. Sometimes you had to keep rocking back and forth for hours on end, as the power didn't always come back on very soon. (You really got to know your individual polio patient under that system!)<br><br>Something like that could work in the post-antibiotic age. But the cost of nursing has gone up since then, and the cost of food and housing for the nursing staff. (It seems from what she said that the nurses weren't allowed to have homes and lives of their own, outside of the wards and the dormitories, or even to leave the hospital buidings very often.)<br><br><a href=#c3802287414905626588 title="comment permalink">8/16/10, 2:37 AM</a><br><br>

It was a big fire and you can still see scorch marks on trees even today.<br><br>As a bit of background, we are in a temperate environment (there were snow flurries here today) and the trees are all hardwood. Rainfall varies between about 600mm and 1,200mm and is fairly constant throughout the year.<br><br>As an experiment though, if you take a chainsaw and cut into a fallen tree which has been on the ground since Ash Wednesday, the timber below the charcoal layer is perfect. You could mill it. The charring does not hold any water, in fact it protects the fallen tree. It's the work of the termites and fungi's that turn that tree into soil. Remember that it's been on the ground for 27+ years.<br><br>Secondly, if I have a burn off of the regrowth and fallen branches which I collect in a pile, I am always left with charcoal as different parts of the fire burn at differing temperatures and with different oxygen supplies. I started digging the left over charcoal into the soil after reading about biochar. The result: After a year, I now have charcoal in the soil, however it looks the same as when it went into it and in no way encourages water retention or speedy growth of plants, or even development of the humus in the soil.<br><br>Maybe we don't have enough microbial life in the soil, who knows?

I have a small herd of dairy goats and, with no money to comply with state regs, I cannot sell their delicious milk or raw cheese. We feed ourselves, our dogs and chickens but there is still a lot that has to be dumped. I have been putting it in the compost or heating it to 185 degrees, putting in vinegar and making a sort of panir that we freeze or give to chickens and them compost the whey. I have wondered what the consequences are of putting milk fat in the compost. I also worry about pouring the waste water from rinsing the glass jars into my drain for I know that milk fats will eventually clog my septic system. What I do is to give the jars an initial rinse in cold water, pour the water into a big bucket and use it to water the raised beds. <br>Because of the pipe clogging effect, could anyone here offer a suggestion as to how I could spray 1) milk 2) skimmed milk 3) whey or diluted milk without destroying my sprayer? I have enough trouble cleaning my sprayer after spraying diluted fish emulsion fertilizer and that isn't nearly as much of a problem as milk. <br>I am very excited about spraying my excess milk, whey and waste water.

His angle is that anybody can garden without bothering themselves with understanding soil ecology. The book is very simple reading. Basically his system is to lay down weed cloth and build a 4' by 4' foot bottomless box out of 2X6 boards. Then he has you fill the box with equal parts of compost, vermiculite, and peat moss. If you buy the compost he wants you to buy 5 different brands because of the fact that every company will use a staple material for the carbon input so this will ensure a good variety. Then you divide the box into 16 square feet and plant each square foot according to the plants size. <br> I got the book cause I was interested in learning raised bed gardening. He insist that 6" is all the plants need for their roots. He also says you don't need fertilizer. After you harvest an annual he just has you add some more compost to the square foot you harvested. His system seems pretty fool proof but for some reason I don't like it. For one you have to have to water very frequently. The other thing I don't like about it is putting the weed cloth down would seem to cut the plants off from the earth. I suppose adding the compost will add the microbes that would be needed for healthy soil ecology and you wouldn't have a problem with weeds. I'm thinking about building a box and trying his system out. Any thoughts?<br><br><a href=#c2654392897918973793 title="comment permalink">8/16/10, 11:55 AM</a><br><br>

We tell our adolescent (itself a recent invention) "children" they can't and shouldn't, stupefy them with seizure-inducing movies and video games, and if that fails, drug them and even institutionalize them.

As to Mel's Mix, I have built raised beds to those specs since his first book came out in 1983 both with and without the underlying filter fabric and never noticed much of a difference. Of course, this method assumes that you are just raising a few annual veggies and you aren't trying to rehab a large acreage. Annual vegetables are very hard on the soil which is why many people are looking to perennial crops. Mel always suggests adding compost for this reason. He isn't trying to work with cover crops to send deep roots into the soil. He is trying to produce a lot of foot in a small space. I think of his beds as basically large flower pots. The roots of most annual veggies don't go very deep. <br>That said, why even use the filter fabric?
