<span style=font-size:130%>Part One: Peak Oil Goes Mainstream</span><br><br>Longtime readers of this blog will recall that one of its central projects early on was an attempt to deconstruct the most deeply entrenched set of myths industrial culture uses to define the future. To borrow a phrase from Carlos Castaneda, the myth of progress and the myth of apocalypse were worthy opponents, and I hope the confrontation with them was as educational, and occasionally entertaining, to my readers as it was to me. I’m pleased to say, though, that the dubious choice between a future of endless progress toward some technocratic Utopia and a future of sudden cataclysmic collapse into some romantic Utopia has lost much of its grip on the peak oil scene.<br><br>That’s not to say these particular narratives have gone away completely. I don’t recall the last time a week passed without at least one message in my inbox claiming that I’m all wrong and humanity will keep on marching onward and upward to a destiny among the stars, and at least one more claiming that I’m all wrong and industrial civilization will blow itself to smithereens at some vague but imminent point in the very near future. Still, such comments no longer make up most of the responses to each week’s post here, as they once did. <i>The Archdruid Report</i> was only one of many voices in the conversation that midwifed that change, of course, but I like to think that it helped.<br><br>That shift needed to happen, not least because today’s peak oil movement may be standing on the brink of a momentous shift very few of us are expecting. For just over a decade now, since the first peak oil activists blew the dust off M. King Hubbert’s predictions and realized that they made a great deal more sense than the easy optimism of the cornucopians, people concerned about peak oil have daydreamed of a future when the rest of the world would finally get around to noticing that you can’t extract an infinite amount of oil from a finite planet, and that technological, economic, and social arrangements predicated on endless supplies of cheap oil might be a good deal less clever than they looked. Very few of us, though, have really taken that possibility seriously, which makes it all the more ironic that peak oil may be on the brink of going mainstream in a big way.<br><br>Place the peak oil movement in its context and the dynamic is hard to miss. Fifteen years ago the idea of peak oil was so far off the radar screens that serious books on energy published by academic publishers – Janet Ramage’s <i>Energy: A Guidebook</i> (Oxford University Press, 1997) is a good example – no longer remembered that oil production would crest long before the last barrel was pumped out of the ground. Ten years ago the peak oil movement was the outermost fringe of the fringe, a tiny network of retired petroleum geologists and engineers crunching numbers to predict the timing of an event most experts claimed would never happen. Five years ago the first really good books on the subject – Kenneth Deffeyes’ <i>Hubbert’s Peak</i>, Richard Heinberg’s <i>The Party’s Over</i>, James Howard Kunstler’s <i>The Long Emergency</i>, and a few others – were in print, and denunciations were beginning to issue forth from pundits who, until that time, had considered the peak oil movement to be beneath their notice.<br><br>Over the last year or so, the journey from fringe to mainstream has shifted into high gear. Peak oil has become a known quantity in the financial media, with a growing number of market pundits treating it as a real and inevitable phenomenon; blue-ribbon panels of various kinds are advising various governments that they really had better start paying attention to the future of petroleum; the US military has given dwindling energy supplies a place high up on the list of imminent threats to America’s security; even the world of haute culture, so often last in line to notice even the biggest changes sweeping through society, has been served up with a jumbo helping of peak oil courtesy of the <a href=http://www.dark-mountain.net/ >Dark Mountain Project</a>. All that remains is for the political leaders of an industrial nation to start talking about peak oil, and to judge from some of Barack Obama’s recent press conferences about the BP oil spill, that day may not be too far away.<br><br>What will happen then? It’s interesting to note that slightly muted versions of the two mythic narratives I discussed earlier in this post play a large role in speculations about the impact of peak oil going public. Some people – not many of them, but there are some – still cling to the hope that the people of the world’s industrial societies will take a deep breath, face up to the challenge of peak oil, and rescue the project of progress and the hope of brighter futures ad infinitum. Others, rather more of them, are convinced that a public announcement that the age of oil is ending will result in mass panic and the collapse of public order in an orgy of rioting, looting, and target practice with live ammo.<br><br>My guess, for what it’s worth, is that neither of these is particularly likely. A great deal depends on the circumstances, to be sure, but I suspect the first reaction will have a good deal in common with the oil shock of the 1970s, when the United States passed its own Hubbert peak and a nation used to limitless cheap energy had to face shortages and soaring prices. When that happened, some people buckled down and got to work; others panicked to one degree or another, though the rioting mobs of survivalist fantasy were in notably short supply; still others dismissed the entire thing as a Communist, liberal, conservative, or Fascist plot – I don’t think anybody but the Amish missed being blamed for the energy crises of the 1970s – and something close to a majority just shrugged or grumbled, according to temperament, and muddled through.<br><br>In the midst of these disparate reactions, a great deal of constructive work got done, and it’s arguable that even now the alternative energy scene hasn’t caught up to the point that the leading edge of the appropriate technology movement had reached when funding cuts and ultracheap oil brought the boom down on the whole thing in the early 1980s. If we get a similar muddle of disparate reactions, another round of equally constructive work is potentially within reach. Of course there will probably also be another round, on a larger and louder scale, of the debate between the myths of progress and apocalypse mentioned earlier in this post, and there will doubtless be plenty of flailing as people work their way through the five stages of peak oil – those are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and getting off your rump and doing something, in case you didn’t know.<br><br>Still, it’s also uncomfortably possible that we could also get something a good deal more destructive than what emerged out of the Seventies. For all the troubles of that decade, energy resources were still relatively plentiful and the economies of the industrial nations were far less topheavy with financial hallucinations, profiteering, and outright graft than they have since become. The limits to growth were in sight, but they had not yet begun to clamp down hard, and energy researchers could reasonably trace a curve of transition that could get the world’s industrial nations to sustainability without massive social and economic trauma.<br><br>That possibility was foreclosed when the leaders of the major industrial nations embraced short term politics instead of meaningful planning in the years right after 1980. At this point, the resources that might have powered a transition to sustainability have been burnt to fuel one last orgy of conspicuous consumption, and the consequences of that final spree, combined with epic economic mismanagement and a good solid helping of chicanery and outright fraud, have tipped the industrial nations of the world over into what promises to be a long and difficult period of economic malfunction.<br><br>When familiar myths fail and life gets difficult, in turn, the results rather too often include a form of collective flight into fantasy well known to sociologists and students of history. Think of cargo cults, Ghost Dancers, Americans waiting in a suburban Chicago backyard to be taken off the planet by the Space Brothers, and every other example you recall of people responding to a difficult situation by a leap of faith to a farther shore that didn’t happen to be there. Now think about it again, remembering that this time the motivating factors may well include the symbols and slogans and passionate hopes that matter most to you.<br><br>The standard jargon for phenomena of this kind is <i>revitalization movements</i>. They happen when a society is hit by repeated troubles that cut straight to the core of its identity and values. In such times, when existing institutions fail and the collective foundations of meaning crack, there’s a large demand for some new vision of destiny that will make sense of the troubles and offer a way past them to some brighter future. The economics of popular belief being what they are, that demand very quickly finds an ample supply.<br><br>Revitalization movements, like new cars, come with standard features and a range of optional gewgaws that can be added on to suit the tastes of the buyer. The standard features include a thorough critique of the existing order of society, which is meant to show that the troubles have occurred because either the people who have suffered from them, or some other group that’s to blame for them, have misbehaved and are being punished; a vision of a Utopian future that will arrive right after the troubles if the right things are done; and a straightforward plan of action to make the transition from the troubles to the Utopian future. The problem is that the plan of action can’t actually deliver the goods; that’s what defines something as a revitalization movement rather than, say, an ordinary movement seeking social change. Revitalization movements emerge when all the practical options for dealing with a crisis are either unworkable or unthinkable.<br><br>The optional features range all over the map from the harmless to the horrific. A focus on purification, for example, is one common optional feature, but purification can mean a great many things. In the Native American revitalization movements of the twentieth century, for example, it usually meant abstaining from alcohol and other toxic products of white culture, and did a great deal to help First Nations communities begin to recover from the ghastly experiences of the previous century. In the European revitalization movements that sprang up in the wake of the Black Death, by contrast, it usually meant getting rid of Jews and other social outsiders who were blamed for spreading the plague, and helped lay the foundation for the witch hunting mania of the following centuries.<br><br>It seems uncomfortably likely to me that such movements could be set in motion by the emergence of peak oil as a publicly acknowledged crisis. Tendencies in that direction are already welded firmly in place in popular culture across the industrial world. The Sarah Palin supporters who turned “Drill, baby, drill” into their mantra du jour are engaging in incantation, to be sure, but there’s more to the slogan than a comfortable thoughtstopper; a great many of the people who mouth it believe with all their heart that all we have to do is drill enough wells and we can have all the petroleum we want, and they are willing to do whatever it takes to get those wells drilled. That plan of action can’t deliver the goods; they might as well be out there with the cargo cults, building mock airfields on isolated Pacific islands hoping to bring back the DC-3s full of K-rations and cheap trade goods that landed on a hundred archipelagoes during the Second World War. Still, that’s not something they are likely to grasp any time soon; mere reason has essentially no power against a nascent revitalization movement.<br><br>The shift from incantation to revitalization movement is under way on the other side of the political spectrum as well, though it hasn’t generally gotten as much traction yet – a reminder that in America, at least, the ideologies of the left these days tend to be favored by the still relatively privileged middle classes, while the working classes that favor ideologies of the right have gotten the short end of the stick for decades. Still, the tendencies are there. Watch the conversations on most reasonably active peak oil forums, and you’re very likely to see people insisting that all of us, or at least a chosen few, can make the transition to a brighter future if only we follow some plan of action they are eager to share. In those conversations, the seeds of the revitalization movements to come are putting out their first tentative shoots.<br><br>If those seeds sprout and blossom, keeping a clear mind amid their heady perfume will be a more challenging task than I suspect most of my readers realize. What sets revitalization movements apart from the more incantatory activities of the true believers in progress or apocalypse is that revitalization movements actually buckle down and do something, and tolerably often, at least some of the things they do are worth doing. Hope is an intoxicating drug; hope blended with opportunities for apparently constructive action is an even stronger one; add the emotional lure of belonging, the promise of mutual support and encouragement, and the rush that comes from dropping ordinary concerns for the single-minded pursuit of a shared ideal, and you’ve got an addictive high that’s hard to resist and harder to quit. That’s why revitalization movements so often gather large crowds, and proceed to follow out the consequences of their internal logic to its furthest extreme, no matter how catastrophic the consequences might be.<br><br>In the present case, they could be catastrophic indeed. I think most people know in theory about the destination of the road paved with good intentions, but revitalization movements that go awry have a bad habit of putting that theory into practice. Next week, I’ll explore those uncomfortable possibilities in more detail, and in the process, show how the magical thinking that underlies revitalization movements could be put to use in much more constructive ways.<br><br>For the moment, though, I want to pass on the counterspell against incantatory thinking that I mentioned at the conclusion of last week’s post. Like the magic spells in fairy tales, it comes with a taboo that limits what you can do with it. The taboo is this: you can use it to guard yourself from incantations, if you think about it and understand it, and you can pass it on to someone else who’s ready to receive and understand it. If you give it to someone who’s not willing to accept it, though, it will cause exactly the flight into incantation and fantasy it’s meant to prevent. Here it is:<br><br><i>There is no brighter future ahead.</i><br><br>Keep it secret; keep it safe. We’ll talk more next week.

Stunning analysis. I've detected the possibility for a cult of revitalisation to emerge out of transition towns, but I believe that is dependent on the individuals within it. All that focus and energy on achieving consensus around a few ideals may be negative in the long run, and lead to cult-like behaviour. But I think on the whole that transition towns as a way of thinking will probably be more positive than negative - it's just that it's not necessarily set up to function as a organising group because the ambit of activities is too wide. I found that in my experience setting one group up, and now that I have delved further into the philosophy of these things, I'm quite pleased it did fail and people went their separate ways, but continued with their same activities. <br><br>The real worry of course is what becomes of the various evangelical cults - they have the organising power and the base of current members, and perhaps throw in few inflammatory readings from say, the Book of Revelation, and there's trouble. Poor old America, where the density of protocults seems to be a bit higher than elsewhere.<br><br><a href=#c6416636021887383020 title="comment permalink">6/9/10, 10:56 PM</a><br><br>

The way I see it a substantial number of people are going to interpret the fall of Rome not as the predictable consequence of an unplanned energy descent or the bursting of a global credit bubble but as the end of the world or some nefarious plot by the U.N. or the liberals or the neocons, etc.<br><br> The United States currently consumes a quarter of the world's resources but it only has 5% of the world's population. The readjustment that is coming from peak oil and the popping of the global credit bubble is going to be a huge psychological shock to many. When they find out that: <i>There is no brighter future ahead.</i> it is going to send some of them through the 5 stages of grief. Those aren't the people I'm worried about.<br><br> The people I'm worried about are the one's who are going to adamantly reject the message as false in favor of a simplistic ideology like drill baby drill. These are the people who will start revitalization movements. The problem is that there is no place in their world view for peak oil. They have been immunized against reality.<br><br> The classic example is Galileo's trial by the Church, but other more destructive cases pervade history. I can see religious groups blaming the country's problems on homosexuals or political groups blaming immigrants in the same way the Inquisition or the Nazis blamed their troubles on witches or Jews. The thought process is highly resistant to facts and impervious to reason.<br><br> I don't believe in the cornucopian fantasies anymore than I lose sleep over the Mad Max apocalypse. What worries me is that belligerent simpletons are going to turn this country into a living hell after a deep depression like Yugoslavia, Weimar Republic, USSR, etc. Or as J.R.R. might have put it: The revitalization movements rising power threatening to plunge the world into a Second Darkness.<br><br><a href=#c4063311720382265217 title="comment permalink">6/10/10, 12:29 AM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c7482959964952334480></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/18006145704406196304 rel=nofollow>Kevin</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>"There is no brighter future ahead." <br><br>This is stoicism with a vengeance! Not that you haven't said it before. <br><br>I well remember that in the 1970s it was possible even for smart people to have hope for a better future. When the rightward political turnabout came in 1980, I like many others thought we were merely in for four to eight years of regressive politics. Even when Bush I came into power, we optimistically predicted that eventually "the pendulum would swing" back toward reason and sound policy. Certainly we never dreamt that watershed would prove to have such far-reaching and permanent consequences, so fatal to our aspirations for a better world: the end not only of the hope that America might in time become a just social democracy, but of the basis of our industrial civilization itself. Would that we had done more to prevent this! <br><br>I can see the immense appeal of a revitalization movement. Getting busy on a better future - even just a better future than might otherwise happen - can be most inspiring. But clearly the "Hope" of Obama's campaign slogan creates expectations on which neither he nor anyone else will be able to deliver, except as a will 'o the wisp leading into nasty bogs. <br><br>I see a distinct possibility of very unpleasant social consequences. In the United States we've always had a tendency toward one form or another of witch-hunting, from Salem to Senator McCarthy. I suspect bad news for whoever happen to be the most unpopular and vulnerable groups in the near to medium future, and perhaps beyond. <br><br>"Keep it secret, keep it safe." <br><br>And do NOT use it, for any reason! Not even if it makes you feel invisible to the incipient spectral zeitgeist.<br><br><a href=#c7482959964952334480 title="comment permalink">6/10/10, 12:43 AM</a><br><br>

Wouldn't a way of life more attuned to the rest of nature be brighter? If so, isn't there just a chance that such a future might be waiting somewhere down the line, for some of us? Certainly, I'm starting to extract myself from the primary economy, as per previous articles from you, and feel a lot happier doing so, so I can imagine a brighter future right now (though I know it's going to get very tough for some while).<br><br>As for the apocalyptic scenario, I'm not so sure it can be easily dismissed. I don't think history can be a good guide for a society that is so far removed from those of the past, with the power of the mantra of technological progress, the entrenched Mother Culture (as Daniel Quinn might put it) and feelings of entitlement. Who's to say how even a small fraction of people might react to their comfortable world collapsing and their aspirations being dashed? With so many people in the world's various societies, even a tiny fraction can have a big influence. I'm not arguing that either extreme scenario is likely, only that one is impossible and the other is possible.<br><br>Tony<br><br><a href=#c9078160312294961220 title="comment permalink">6/10/10, 3:53 AM</a><br><br>

That was wonderful.<br><br>I can see all too well how a revitalization movement of the left would play out. One of the deep dark secrets of many who participated in campus activism during the Vietnam War years is this: the shouting crowd and the passionate belief that we were present at the creation of Paul Kantner's "new continent of earth and fire" (i.e., a transformed society based on love and pleasure, throwing off the chains of materialism, hierarchy and Puritanical sex-negativity) gave a better high than any drug out there. Given a chance to experience that again, especially when the other choice is a de-glamorized life of hard slogging physical work at an age when physical work is getting more difficult, large numbers of us can be expected to run toward it, even if we know on some level that we'll be making Neil Young's choice: to burn out rather than fade away.<br><br><a href=#c3257813765302343880 title="comment permalink">6/10/10, 4:04 AM</a><br><br>

The Masons have been using their secrets as their number one advertising tool for 300 years, you know. <br><br>Tony, the phrase is a spell, not a prediction; it's meant to immunize against a particular kind of delusional hope.

I can see this happening when so many Americans refuse to believe or adjust to a lower energy poorer future and the politicians follow their (our) lead to an “easy” short term solution rather than facing reality.<br>Jimmy Carter tried to have Americans face reality about our energy consumption, and took real steps to reduce our energy consumption and wean us off of cheap petroleum, and look what happened to him. I fear that the American public (especially here in the ultra conservative deep-south) will not readily accept that the version of the “American Dream” that has been sold to them since the 1960’s is now unattainable. I fear that the population will seek to lash out at someone and since the South has a history of violence and falling under the sway of demagogues that we will see this again.<br>I do not fear a Mad Max collapse, but I do fear the reaction of the local population when their way of life that they are accustomed to becomes unattainable. I can think of no other region that so embraced the car culture more the deep south with an exception of the southwest and the loss of cheap personal transportation is going to be painful in these areas.<br>I do have hope that the US, is to broke to sustain or even embark on a military campaign of the scale necessary to secure a foreign powers mineral wealth. But we only have to look to 1930-40’s Japan to see a nation that viewed short term gains from military action to secure resources as being beneficial, to warn us of a possible future that the US could embark on if that is the direction that our populace decides to take.<br><br><a href=#c837668666510290314 title="comment permalink">6/10/10, 7:38 AM</a><br><br>

Three years later in 2007, the intensity of such reactive incantations slowed to a substantial trickle.

I wonder what you think of Michael C. Rupperts http://www.collapsenet.com/ launch two days ago. Apparently he launched it early which makes me wonder about the sudden urgency for him to make that move.<br><br>I just read "Confronting Collapse," and I found it to be stunning to say the least. I also just read "The Long Descent," and have a copy of "The Ecotechnic Future" that I will begin reading today. I find your voice to be the most well rounded, logical, and realistic within the PO movement. I think you mostly stay on the middle road between the two mythic polarities. It is my spiritual belief (influenced mainly by Buddhist belief) that the middle road is always the best and most true.<br><br>My problem right now is that Ruppert seems to think things are more urgent than you. I have a hard time refuting what he thinks because of his track record and credentials. He seems to be someone who should be taken seriously. I wonder if maybe you could say a word or two about what he is doing? I would greatly appreciate you knowledge and advice.

These are the same people who (demographically) make up the Tea Party They rest in the pleasant summit of the energy bubble, their material worries are whether they can still afford the boat AND the jet skis AND the gold wing, thought they may rant about hardship and rail against the government impoverishing them, they have no clue at all what real impoverishment might feel like. When their beloved handed-down-by-Jesus sacred "free market capitalism" actually begins to fail them and really hurt them, their tune will change. There may or may not be atheists in foxholes, but there are no libertarians in homeless shelters (though there are quite a few of them on food stamps; go figure). I expect those movements will gradually evaporate as people REALLY have to worry day-to-day about food, clothing, and shelter. They'll be too busy to spend their time protesting gay marriage. Don't get me wrong, I don't expect evangelism to disappear as a religious movement, but I think its days as a major plitical force are likely numbered.<br><br><a href=#c1813332247150826227 title="comment permalink">6/10/10, 11:52 AM</a><br><br>

The Tea Party and Evangelicals are neither one suited for a revitalization movement. The Tea Party is not a single thing. It is mostly a coalition of libertarians, conservatives and small-business people that have banded together, despite their widely disparate views on almost everything else, to try to regain some sanity in government spending. They see the current course, started by the TARP bailouts, as a certain path to financial destruction for the country. <br><br>Evangelicals, even though they do, by and large, have a common set of beliefs, don't even come close to having a common agenda. While any revitalization movement that comes from the conservative Right will have an Evangelical or at least Christian shibboleth or three, Evangelicalism (or Fundamentalism or Catholicism, or Mormonism) will not be at the core of it.<br><br>The likeliest spot such a movement could arise on the right is the pro-war, anti-Islamists. Indeed, they are halfway there, and seem to have a unique ability to get their agenda implemented in practice.<br><br>As far as movements from the Left, I see three likely bases. The 1st is the Global warming movement. It has everything in place, a convenient scapegoat(SUV owners and the American Middle Class), a comprehensive solution (Cap and Trade) and a proven inability to engage in rational discussion or question their own premises.<br><br>The 2nd is the anti-Israel (excuse me, pro-Palestinian) Left. The 3rd is the one-world government supporters. While they have the needed pieces, I don't see them getting sufficient traction to be able to implement their preferred policies, at least in the US.

It's worth remembering that the megachurches are entertainment centers; they attract people who want to be entertained, not people who want an authentic connection to the divine, and people who want to be entertained are not exactly prone to becoming zealots. <br><br>Sgage, ouch.

You can't have the future you want; no matter what you do, at this point, your future is going to involve fewer choices, fewer comforts, fewer privileges, and a lot more deprivation and hard work than almost anyone in the industrial world is willing to imagine. If we buckle down and get to work, we might be able to preserve some things of great value that might otherwise be lost forever, and we might be able to make the world somewhat less harsh for our descendants. That's the best hope I can offer.

The point where everybody starts holding hands in a circle and singing thoughtstoppers is the point where I'm out of there. Still, your point is a good one; a lot of the raw material of future revitalization movements is already all over the place. <br><br>Nebris, yes, I saw that. An Iran-style theocracy in post-Saudi Arabia would certainly liven things up!<br><br>Joan, oh, granted -- the political crazy quilt in the US is much more complex than the very rough generalization I sketched out. <br><br>Danby, you know, I've never actually met anybody who favors a one world government; they mostly seem to exist these days as an imaginary replacement for Communism on the part of the old-fashioned right. As for revitalization movements, I don't think the Tea Party is there yet; there would have to be quite a bit of drift and the rise of a prophet-figure to make that happen -- though it might well do so. As for the others, well, watch the liberal middle class, where the New Age standing in circles and singing stuff JC mentioned above is standard practice.

We need to feel we are moving towards something desirable, even if we never quite get there, or get there and are disappointed (in which case we simply find a new goal). We find hope, motivation, and inherent satisfaction in the act of pursuit. <br><br>The modern goal of achieving social status through accumulating wealth and goods has passed it's sell-by date. Soon those who pursue it will need a new goal to replace it, and that need is as significant a part of their predicament as the need for food or shelter. <br><br>Revitalization movements are appealing because they do precisely that - give you a new horizon to chase. Any competition they face will have to do the same - offer people a future worth working towards, however difficult. Like the Nietzsche quote says, people can tolerate hardship more easily when they believe it is towards a worthy end.<br><br>I understand the sentiments behind 'there is no brighter future.' But it sounds as though it is saying that there is no future worth pursuing, which I know is not what you think nor what you mean it to convey. <br><br>I also think it overlooks how people process disappointment. The man who, after suffering a career disaster, talks about spending more time with his kids is a modern cliche. The person who, after being maimed by accident or illness, talks about how they have grown as a person is another. Their future is not brighter, so they redefine 'bright' to suit their purposes. <br><br>I suspect that the 'spell' which succesfully counters the revitalization movements will tap this tendency - will get people to look at a realistically poor and difficult vision of the future, and somehow see in it something more worthy of pursuit than the pipe-dream offered by the next guy.<br><br><a href=#c4091202451210905241 title="comment permalink">6/10/10, 5:49 PM</a><br><br>

I believe by including the word "financial" that they are specifically committing to ensuring the continuation of money and finance indefinitely in the post-peak-oil world; I guess they want to maintain something more sophisticated, erudite, and classy than that icky old stuff like "barter" and "trade for work." Surely we have progressed beyond those old worn out concepts! Their principles and jargon are thoroughly rooted in late 20th century American market capitalism. <br><br>They conducted an experiment in a "local currency," or so I learned from their web site. To my wife and me it just looked like a $10 off coupon that was supposed to be valid at any member of the local chamber of commerce; but no business we presented it to would take it. We had no idea that we were part of a cutting edge experiment in Financial Permaculture that was being monitored by a worldwide audience. <br><br>I realize I am being way too sarcastic here; these are for the most part very well-intentioned people and many of them have even had us in their homes as guests. But they are so wrapped up in a world view and jargonistic style that to me is simply Corporate America with a green twist. As some around here have been quoted as saying, "Green is Gold." I suppose I also should not scoff at their workshops, ranging in price from $500 to $2200, where you can "learn how to create financially and ecologically sound businesses that regenerate the full living community in [your] life-place." After all our local economy can use the cash influx. But still, look at that description and its emphasis on "finance" and "business." Is this a new way of viewing society, economy, and productivity? Not to my ears.<br><br>Perhaps you attract what you put out: The flagship tenant in the new "Ecoindustrial Green Business Park" proved to be a ponzi scheme and evaporated in to thin air without ever hiring a single employee. A nice fellow who moved here from New York to work there is now pushing a hot dog cart around the Tractor Supply parking lot -- really good hot dogs, I might add! And the Ecoindustrial Park is still vacant; it's even more empty than the other regular ordinary Industrial Park that was built a decade or two ago on the south side of town. <br><br>I repeat -- does any of this really sound like a new way of doing anything? To me it sounds more like attempts to preserve all the things we are far too familiar with -- money, careers, investments, employer-employee relations, corporate organization, etc. <br><br>Just one small example of what has happened in one poor rural Tennessee county since peak oil became mainstream here.<br><br><a href=#c882502969088984552 title="comment permalink">6/10/10, 9:03 PM</a><br><br>

Without hope, as almost any philosopher could tell you, the rules of the game change significantly. Some people will give up in despair, or even commit suicide, but many (maybe even most) will react with some kind of violence, either taking limited resources from others or trying to protect their property from others. <br><br>This sort of behavior has been going on since the beginning of recorded history, and it appears to be part of the nature of human nature.<br><br>You wrote, "You can't have the future you want; no matter what you do, at this point, your future is going to involve fewer choices, fewer comforts, fewer privileges, and a lot more deprivation and hard work than almost anyone in the industrial world is willing to imagine." <br><br>I understand perfectly. In fact, I'm already there (having gone through unemployment, bankruptcy, and losing a nice house) and I don't like it one bit! I would do just about anything to improve my prospects and the future for my kids, even if smart people like you keep assuring me that all my efforts will be futile. This is also part of the nature of human nature. <br><br>What do people do when they face the realistic prospect of no brighter future? We have several examples from history. Millions of poor, hungry people left Ireland for an uncertain future in America rather than face the certainty of starving to death during the potato famine. Millions of refugees literally risked their lives in leaky boats fleeing from the certainty of no brighter future in places like Cuba, Viet,Nam and Haiti.<br><br>So, what would they have done if the land of opportunity did not exist for them to flee to so they could have a shot at a brighter future? If they had weapons they would use them, rather than let their children starve or be slaves of the State (this is why so many totalitarian governments like to confiscate the guns, you know). <br><br>With very few exceptions, the overwhelming majority of people will refuse to voluntarily choose poverty and servitude (at least, this is what the historical record tells us; what would lead us to believe that future history would be any different?). <br><br>People may have to accept such things if absolutely forced to, just as many people have done throughout history, but if you think very many people are going to go quietly into that non-bright future, you are just as unrealistic as the techno-cornucopians like Ray Kurzweil.<br><br>You wrote, "If we buckle down and get to work, we might be able to preserve some things of great value that might otherwise be lost forever, and we might be able to make the world somewhat less harsh for our descendants. That's the best hope I can offer. If it's not enough for you, then that's the way it goes."<br><br>Of course we can preserve things of great value! Among other things, many of us have been trying to collect old books that will provide useful info for living a self-sufficient life after the Google server farms go down. All I was trying to say in my post is that the probability of a <i>peaceful</i> transition to a post-fossil fuel world is very close to zero.<br><br>Peak Oil may have already happened, but the end of technical civilization is still a few years off, so we do have time to make a (relatively) successful transition. We just have to learn to resist the demagogues of all stripes who will try to lead us in bad directions. That, and try to overcome our own violent, greedy, fearful human nature...<br><br><a href=#c951609718444338640 title="comment permalink">6/10/10, 10:25 PM</a><br><br>

It is the pursuit of security which creates a wake of calamity just a sure as calamity can lead to understanding. Look how long it has taken for mankind to become aware of universality....just nation to nation. There is no real reason to despair.<br><br>To understand the source-meanings of words like god, infinity, and lord can easily point to this fact. Did you know good sir...the oldest meaning of "Lord" as referred to in Genesis and noted in the margins of many bibles is "wind"? No more and no less when one examines and considers the anthropomorphic context of such. Wind brought both calm and calamity to those desert tribes much as it does to modern man. <br><br>There has never been a perfect world nor will there ever be one. There are...however....'islands of peace' that exist in all dimensions of consciousness...as quantum mechanics slowly certifies for the scientific mind....the same understanding which is reached by those who undertake the quest to understand existance. These places exist whether one is aware of them or not just as surely as life can be argued as 'extant'.<br><br>Believing this earth must rise to some utopic zenith...some nirvanic existance...disallows continuity... which is exampled in the natural order all around us. It is like worshiping a false idol. When you examine words attributed to the Biblical Jehova such as "I am both good and evil" you must consider the science of expansion/contraction theories.....for they exist in parallel meaning. Even the recent experiments with the small particle accelerator in the US is pointing out that there is something unique to existance by the specifics of attraction. <br><br>Falling into the state of survival ....exclusively..... completely subjugates consciousness Moose. Matter can neither be created nor destroyed my brother. It merely alters and changes through and of dimensions.<br><br>As old friend Bob Dylan once sang, "good and bad I define these terms...quite clear..no doubt...somehow...ahh but I was so much older then...I'm younger than that now". <br><br>Existance is for....ever...my friend....in one form or another and we are all just along for the ride.<br><br><a href=#c8902489127144742527 title="comment permalink">6/10/10, 11:20 PM</a><br><br>

My (not particularly efficient) backup generator can produce this same amount of energy for about 40 litres (10 gallons) of unleaded fuel.

My impression is that many engineers, academics, intellectuals, politicians (whether in America, Europe, USSR or anywhere) were rather aware of the issue, and many of them knew those few books and analyses. I remember casual discussion of the topic in books or journals I read. The common assumption was probably that the issue will be addressed on time, that people are working on it. Oil companies may have had their won opinions and plans - but hey, BP was not that <i>private</i> and shamelessly profit-oriented before Thatcher, just as the other companies.<br><br>What changed in these three decades was not so much the people concerned with peak issues, but the <b>deniers</b>. Those few decades ago, even evolution deniers were relatively benign. It was tobacco companies that were advancing the rather juvenile art of denial. And then floodgates of corporate interest were open, and by the 1990s there was already a whole industry of denial - rather diverse, but mutually self-enforcing and focused. We should not forget that even the most stereotypic facets of self-interest take some time to evolve. There is ridiculously much projection of today’s cognitive cliches to rather different intellectual cultures of previous times.<br><br>As interesting question is: How much top-to-bottom <i>internal logic</i> is in these big shifts of economic and ecological thinking, as well as in those revitalization movements, Jew, witch or virgin burning? If you know the behavior of masses, wouldn’t anyone have good techniques to move (or not move) them? Would you necessarily tell publicly your knowledge, predictions and plans? A last compulsive consumption orgy makes sense if a short devastating chaos with your own survival to a long and relatively abundant peace on Earth are feasible. I probably asked here already, wouldn’t that be feasible?<br><br>But some revitalization type movements would be quite spontaneous, locally organized and locally targeted. I would not be fast to ridicule them. The mantra of <i>good intentions pavements</i> is too convenient to block people from trying their own way of dealing with obvious difficulties. We probably should know more about good intentions.<br><br>By the way, <a href=http://www.ouramazingplanet.com/infographic-tallest-mountain-to-deepest-ocean-trench-0249/ rel=nofollow>here is a picturesque perspective</a> how deep BP was drilling.

I am NOT advocating criminal behavior in the face of dwindling resources, and I certainly do not want to shoot anyone so I can take their food, or anything like that.<br><br>In a world of limited resources, the average quality of life is going to be inversely proportional to the quantity of life. In that environment, life really will be a zero sum game, and the only way to get a bigger slice of the economic pie will be to take someone else's slice. Or reduce the quantity... <br><br>Only as a last resort will most people willingly settle for less. They will exhaust ALL other possibilities first, and only then accept what Mr. Greer has told them is inevitable.<br><br>Currently, we can use fossil fuels to improve human productivity, which increases per capita wealth, which means that everybody can get a bigger piece of the pie without having to take it from someone else. <br><br>What JMG is saying is that the world of the ever-increasing pie is coming to an end. I agree that this is about as inevitable as it gets (unless someone develops hydrogen fusion or some other improbable technology).<br><br>All I'm trying to say is that, human nature being what it is, there will be lots of people who WILL engage in violent behavior when they realize that what we have now is as good as it's ever going to get. So, as soon as enough people realize that what JMG says is true, there will be large-scale unpleasantness...<br><br>Ask yourself a simple question: Why do people go to war? There may be racial or religious overtones, but almost every war in history has been fought over resources of one kind or another (liebensraum, oil, whatever). That's what happens when there aren't "enough" resources to go around, and it's been going on since before the beginning of recorded history. Do you have any reason to believe that the coming age of dwindling resources and falling standards of living will be any different?<br><br>mxyzptlk:<br><br>Nonexistence is not an option, as far as I'm concerned.

I thought at the time that I'd be better off finding a place back up in the mountains and building a homestead. It sounds ridiculous stated that way but since I already lived in those mountains I likely could have bought a place easily. The only problem being there wasn't a way to make a living without a long commute. Ever since that time I've been trying to save books and acquire skills I could use in that nebulous future. <br><br>I've never been one to love the company of people enough to WANT to live in a town but I've done a lot of that in my journey from then to now. Growing my own garden doesn't seem like a chore to me, canning would be the challenge!<br><br>Coming from parents that DID eat home grown during the depression and even had a cow and chickens, as a kid I asked my mother to demonstrate how to milk a cow. I think I can do that. I don't look forward to the muscle cramps! I don't see that kind of work as drudgery. A nine to five for people who consider you as disposable, that's drudgery! <br><br>Breeding and training horses and cow dogs for income, growing my own garden, a medicinal herb garden for human and animal, trees to provide fruit and oil for personal use and some trade, that's the correct way to live. Not zipping down the road in a climate controlled metal can, going to a large wooden box where you only see the outdoors from windows if any are available, parking your fanny in a chair and having 'entertainment' poured into your unresisting brain along with your daily dose of economic enticement/advertisements. This is living?<br><br>I have more fun on horseback, playing tag, polocrosse, penning cows or just taking a quiet ride, seeing more than anyone can possibly see from the windows of a noisy, moving car.<br><br>If I keep my head down on the stable and my mouth shut on my opinion about what's coming, keep my nose out of politics when it takes a hard, two wheel, screaming turn in the wrong direction and QUIETLY provide assistance to my neighbors when help is needed, me, my friends and the girls ought to make it. Living a good life and quietly prospering in ways society doesn't consider prospering now. If I can juggle those various events, like juggling a big knife, a couple of raw chicken eggs and a mask of conventionality we might do okay!

If you use it to keep going, while remaining aware of the hard realities of the situation, it's something more useful. <br><br>Wolf, well, yes. <br><br>Rick, the "conservative" victories of the 1980s, which were not conservative at all in any real sense, were profoundly regressive. They marked the death of the last scraps of authentic conservatism, replacing it with a borrow-and-spend ethos that inflated government to unparalleled scales and calmly passed the bill for it to future generations. They also marked the end of any realistic attempt to prepare for the end of the age of cheap energy. Both of those were disastrous; the latter involves the worst costs over the long term. <br><br>Kevin, that's 100% Doctor Fox's Genuine Arkansas Snake Oil, there! I'm the last person to dismiss the importance of sacred geometry; it's a profound and transformative discipline, but claiming that it breaks the laws of thermodynamics (which is what this claim amounts to) is like saying that the right mixture of chemicals will make two plus two equal five.<br><br>Moose, there are other things to live for besides the dream of endlessly expanding material wealth.

I think you're letting a certain class of apocalyptic fantasy shape your view of the future.<br><br>Girl, that last comment of yours -- "We might do okay.

Oh wait …. Sorry …. Were you suggesting that other people will build it for you if you ask nicely?<br>Hell, give it a crack, who knows, you might just be lucky enough to live in a time when people dont put their hands over their ears and chant LA LA LA at these suggestions. So I suggest you go for it. Make it happen. Who knows, you might just be the guy that gets lucky. And if it doesnt happen you can always say that you gave it a red hot go. Theres no shame in failing that way.<br>I've gotta say though.... I don't think much of you're chances.<br><br>Hi Moose<br>“I think you misunderstand where I'm coming from.”<br>“I certainly do not want to shoot anyone so I can take their food, or anything like that.”<br>I dont believe I misunderstood, I was probably responding a tad theatrically though. In American and Australian folk history the outlaw tends to have a romantic mystique. However look closer and the outlaw was not simply a person who chose to live an “alternative lifestyle with multiple unorthodox income streams”. The outlaw was a person who had been declared no longer protected by civil society and viciously killing an outlaw by any means would get you respect and status in your community. <br>So your question was, “whats to stop anyone xxxx-ing whenever they please” My answer was the torches and pitchforks of those who have been xxxx-d. Personally I dont like the idea, it all sounds too susceptible to corruption and manipulation for my taste, plus theres all that icky pitchforking to do. But you did bring it up.<br><br>“the only way to get a bigger slice of the economic pie”<br>I had some economic pie yesterday.. Yeuchh!! tasted all numbery and the decimal points kept getting stuck in my teeth.<br><br>Ok .. economic pie. Here we go.<br><br>There is no economic pie anywhere waiting to be sliced. For most of us the way to get our taste of economic pie is to join in an ongoing pie making process. Now maybe the flavour of pie you are experienced in making is no longer popular. That happens. It sucks when you are standing on the side of the road trying to sell pie that no one wants. Everyones a b*stard when they turn up their noses at your pie. I know because I have been there as well. The bakerys I work in have changed so much that the way I make pie now is very different to the way I made pie 10 years ago. So you need to either help people whose pies are popular or think about manufacturing pie that will be in demand now and in the future. Thats not always easy to achieve, but by and large thats the way that people have always lived. The best way to get some pie, is to make some pie.<br><br>“there will be large-scale unpleasantness...”<br>There already is large scale unpleasantness. You dont want to go getting involved in any of that do you?<br><br>“Do you have any reason to believe that the coming age of dwindling resources and falling standards of living will be any different?”<br>Different from the rest of history? Probably not. People will be born and people will die. Sometimes you will be sick and sometimes you will be healthy. Someone will be rich and someone else will be poor. Someone will fart and everyone will laugh except for the person who is offended.

However, I don't see how the blanket dismissal of all revitalization movements makes sense. Revitalization: the etymology must come from vita, life. The belief in progress lost most of its traction during the past couple of decades: a death. Postmodernity has no life to offer: it is, in the words of Bruno Latour, "intellectual immobility through which humans and non-humans are left to drift." So the appeal for a story with some life in it is clear. <br><br>And why not work on collaboratively creating such a story? Certainly, ecofascism is one of many dangers. But is that any reason to stop writing stories? The mantra you suggest is problematic on at least two fronts: 1) it's politically suicidal; 2) a great part of the Majority World is already living in less-than-bright conditions, and who are we to presume we know the shade of their future (or to pretty much condemn them to a dark future by failing to do what we can to make it better?) I am sure the petro-elite benefits from your post-political stance proclaiming that the future will not be bright: it removes any political threat. People without ideals are not dangerous; people who don't believe in larger projects are no threat to power. <br><br>Ulrich Beck: "If you see an opposition between modernity and nature, then you see the planet too fragile to support the hopes and dreams for a better world. And then you will have to envision and enforce a kind of international caste system in which the poor of the developing world are consigned to (energy) poverty in perpetuity. The politics of limits will be 'anti'-- anti-immigration, anti-globalization, anti-modern, anti-cosmopolitan and anti-growth. It will combine Malthusian environmentalism with Hobbesian conservatism."<br><br><a href=#c4317389531546322934 title="comment permalink">6/12/10, 2:45 PM</a><br><br>

That's not what I'm saying at all. We built the current crappy, ecocidal built environment over ~70 to 100 years, and it will probably take a comparable time period to replace it. I never said that it would be easy, or that it would result in a Crystal Spires and Togas Utopia, only that it would result in a lifestyle that is arguably more pleasant than Suburban Hell. <br><br>When Red Neck Girl talked about creating a future that <i>she</i> feels is "brighter" (or better, more satisfying, happier) than a life of commuting from Suburban Hell to a Cubicle Borg job, I didn't see you guys saying, "Nooo! That's impooosssible! You have to be more miserable! Can't you at least starve or something?"<br><br>I'm guessing that's because her approach is consistent with the only alternative Americans can imagine to Suburban Hell and CARS CARS CARS: a return to Little House on the Prarie. Which is fine for those who want that lifestyle and can afford it. <br><br>Still, the vast majority of people can't go back to plowing the fields of the family farm behind oxen any more than they can paint their skin florescent blue and become Na'vi hunter-gatherers. I am still not convinced that they can't do what city people have done since Catal Huyuk, but with better plumbing and some wind turbines and trains.<br><br>Panidaho: Our current built environment is r-selected, built to get quick returns, not to last. It has to be continuously patched and propped up. Currently there are over 10,000 road work projects underway, with a budget of $26.6 billion. <a href=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ rel=nofollow>Source</a>. But...how is that <i>possible</i>? No one has any money or resources! Somebody get me a butterfly net, I want some bacon.<br><br>So, legacy built environment in the way: can it still be usable after oil?<br><br>Yes: Retrofit it as much as possible and muddle through.<br><br>No: Then it will have to be replaced or scavenged and abandoned anyway, and the people leaving it are going to want someplace else to live.<br><br>I live within a short drive from Taos Pueblo. This is a place that was built by hand, without a drop of fossil fuel, and has been maintained with hand tools for over a thousand years. That's <i>sustainability</i>. The people who live there are "poor" in balance-sheet terms, but they don't seem eager to leave. It's urban-dense (walkable, no CARS), and there's no reason something like it couldn't be scaled up to be a full-sized Traditional City with bath houses and restaurants and artisans and markets and a great night life. <br><br>So why, exactly, is it harmful to project something like that as preferable to Drill Baby Drill, followed by Mad Max, followed by The Road, followed by the Dark Ages (a.k.a. the unspoken Republican Party Platform)?<br><br>BTW, would you guys object if I cited your comments in full and unedited in more in-depth responses on my blog, with links back here?

Weaver, June 3, 2010 at 10:52 am<br><br>The transition away from oil to the next epoch of modern energy does require a more electrified society. But even more it also requires a dramatic change in the architecture of products and our politics. 1. For example, an airliner can go from 85 PMPG (passenger miles per gallon) to 250 by changing the architecture; no engine change is required. Impossible you say because it would be so done already. Not so. It does not necessarily follow that Airbus or Boeing know all, they do not. 2. Nuclear using thorium can get 75% of the energy from the reaction versus 5% for Uranium. Uranium for energy happened because we wanted the bomb, and the plutonium for the big one. 3. Elevated medium weight rail along our super highways with remote controlled modules can eliminate most long haul trucking and replace most short haul air traffic. Coupled with 250 PMPG airliners for long trips, you get the picture. And high-speed rail for passengers doesn’t have to be 200 mph; 110 mph (interstate maximum design speed) is good enough and maximally efficient making 500 PMPG rail modules very feasible, and all electric. 4. Clean coal does not mean sequestering CO2 because CO2 is no cause of global warming, but it does mean a new architecture for coal power stations, which we have heretofore refused to embrace. 5. Heat pumps can heat every home and increase comfort levels. 6. All 132 million-commuter cars can be EV’s, but not using the architecture of present designs we see evolving. And a bullet truck can double heavy haul truck fuel efficiency, improve stopping safety, and with their high streamlining greatly reduce small car buffeting. 7 Politicians are in the way of change. Either ahead of an election or immediately thereafter they plug the system full of pork spending to reward their buddies while failing to reform existing programs after they are elected. 8. One thing is certain, we can’t bully our way to oil supplies as Japan tried in WWII; that could result in an all out nuclear war. We are better off to change our product architectures (achieve serious energy efficiency improvements or full blown alternatives) and reform our politics rather than to fight wars over oil energy. 9. Change is inevitable, and there are always new problems to solve, and new challenges and opportunities for every generation. 10. The U.S. can survive peak oil without mishap, but we need to start pulling together as team to make it happen. Shale gas, oil sands in Canada, and clean-coal using existing coal reserves, wind and solar and biomass and a completely new (maximally efficient) architecture for all big energy using products will create our new energy futur<br><br><a href=#c7171028725078188518 title="comment permalink">6/12/10, 11:45 PM</a><br><br>

I only have time for a couple of quick comments. One, I wonder if peak oil going mainstream will work about the same as global warming going mainstream: they make a thriller movie about it, people hear pundits argue it interminably and they tuck it into the back of their minds until the day they see "Plastic bottles $10; bring your own bottle, Free", or some concrete result, in their groceries. Two, having just hosted a thoroughly suburban relative of mine, next generation, I am more convinced that without revitalization movements, folks like her will simply cave in and give up! Even if the movements are little crumbs that distract them as they are (unconsciously) adjusting to the new norm, it might be what most people will need. Those who can look reality in the eye are few and far between (one reason I love this blog). I had a third thought, but it's escaped... maybe later.<br><br><a href=#c382370744059646266 title="comment permalink">6/13/10, 8:06 AM</a><br><br>

(The scary part is, we're actually flat broke by any reasonable reckoning, but we're creating huge amounts of debt, waging wars of many kinds upon other nations and taking unreasonable risks with the environment so we can keep pretending we aren't.) <br><br>Given this, individuals and small groups of like-minded folks "muddling through" together (as discussed in previous posts) will almost assuredly accomplish the vast majority of what transition work actually gets done as we slide down the other side of the Peak, and most likely without much help - if any - from their respective governments. <br><br>So, good luck and get to work! ;-)<br><br><a href=#c7380534364197907437 title="comment permalink">6/13/10, 8:12 AM</a><br><br>

But when he says "the availability of fossil fuel is going to be diminishing," that sounds like a description of a downward trend to me, with the implication that there was a peak of availability back in the past somewhere, and the rather obvious corollary that the slope will eventually bottom out. <br><br>Still, I'm sure you're right in the sense that when Obama says "I have no idea what new energy sources are going to be available, what technologies might drive down the price of renewable energies," he's not facing the fact that no new energy sources are going to be available and that in all probability nothing will drive down the price of renewable energies. <br><br>Bill, that history is exactly what I had in mind. Perhaps I should alter my statement to say "29 and a half years ago," because that is when Reagan came to power and it became Morning In America. We've been on a road of feckless consumption for essentially three decades. I well remember Carter's energy frugality policies about keeping the thermostat down, wearing sweaters in the house, and going solar. I also remember seeing a vanity license plate at that time which read "55 2 SLO." Unfortunately that driver got their wish, and so here we are.<br><br><a href=#c3719041814313704690 title="comment permalink">6/15/10, 11:53 AM</a><br><br>

One reviewer notes:<br><br>"The book, an edited work, seeks to address a gap in scholarship, to wit, where others have covered why and how complex societies have collapsed, there is virtually nothing on how some, not all, regenerate. The editors do point out that most collapses are not total, and something is left...<br><br>The combined authors posit a cycle of growth, collapse, and regeneration between ruralism and local autonomy, and urbanization with centralization of control. <br><br>In an excellent but not quite complete summary of the causes of collapse, the editors outline the following: <br><br>1. Fragmentation into smaller political entities <br>2. Partial or complete desertion of urban centers <br>3. Loss or depletion of centalizing functions <br>4. Breakdown of regional economic systems <br>5. Failure of civilization's ideology <br><br>They do not mention the latest and best explanation, that the more complex a society becomes, the more expensive it is to make incremental improvements in management, and the unaffordability of the always increasing cost for each always decreasingly effective improvement ultimately leads to implosion..."<br><br><a href=#c6895014222525156362 title="comment permalink">6/15/10, 9:28 PM</a><br><br>

If that simple fact is absorbed one finds the most powerful aspect of the 3 levels of control we learn in the 1st 21 months (+ or -) of life......the center....acceptance. These other two are 1st recognition and 3rd manipulation. The most important thing to use in changing times is the innate ability to adapt... and adaptation is a willingness to release old useless control mechanisms so we can adapt. Acceptance is the factor which increases both the former and the latter aspects.<br><br><a href=#c6601913957455871496 title="comment permalink">6/15/10, 9:40 PM</a><br><br>

I have lost the few friends I had...some for 30-40 years, by trying to talk about these truths. They told me they could not deal with my 'negativity' any longer. So now I avoid conversation; which, sadly, isn't difficult to do at my age. No one is interested in anything I have to say anyway! The point for me, now, is to try and create some kind of livable life for the years left to me, (I'm glad there won't be too many!) in a place where I can live a slower life, hopefully close to bits of nature, and books! I'll keep my computer, there are a few blogs really worth reading, like yours. thanks again.<br><br><a href=#c2694891085176818176 title="comment permalink">6/17/10, 11:59 AM</a><br><br>
