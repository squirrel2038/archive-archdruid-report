The discussion of revitalization movements and fantasies of collective redemption over the last two weeks here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i> had an interesting though by no means unexpected result. Several people asked me whether I thought it might be possible to harness some movement of the same broad sort to get people to do the things they need to do to get ready for peak oil.<br><br>This is hardly a new idea, of course. Back in the late 1990s, when the first peak oil email lists were taking shape, the idea of organizing a peak oil movement on the large scale came up for discussion now and again, and some attempts were made, though none of them managed to find much of an audience. More recently, toward the middle of the last decade, the Post Carbon Institute launched a network of relocalization groups, which flourished for a while and then suddenly folded for reasons I’ve never seen discussed. Over the last few years, in its turn, the Transition Town movement has made its own transition from a college project to an international network helping communities put together plans to cope with a future of energy scarcity and strict carbon-footprint limits.<br><br>It’s fair to say that none of these was or is a mass movement of the kind I was discussing; the earlier examples belong on the same list of would-be mass movements that never got off the ground as, say, Technocracy, while the last is still very much in the early phases of its trajectory, early enough that its final destination is anybody’s guess. Still, it’s easy to see why the idea of a grand collective movement in the direction of sustainability is so appealing to so many people.<br><br>To begin with, the failure of the established order of industrial society, and of the political classes who manage it, is becoming hard to ignore. Consider the way that the world’s political leaders have reacted to the implosion of the global economy, or the way that the US government and BP management have reacted to the ongoing death by oil of the Gulf of Mexico: in each case, it’s a broken-record sequence of understating the problem, trying to manage appearances, getting caught flatfooted by events, and struggling to load the blame for yet another round of failures onto anybody within reach. Rinse and repeat a few times, and even the most diehard supporters of the status quo start wishing that somebody, somewhere, would stand up and demonstrate some actual leadership.<br><br>At the same time, for those of us who have been trying to get the message of peak oil out for the last decade or more, the spreading cracks in the great wall of denial can give rise to a certain intoxication. When pundits insist that there’s enough oil in current reserves to last 800 years , or that oil discoveries have more than kept pace with extraction rates all along, or that the only limits to the amount of oil we can get out of the earth are economic – all of which statements have appeared in the media in recent weeks, and all of which can easily be disproved by readily available figures or, in the last case, by plain common sense – it’s hard to miss the desperation in their words. “First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win,” Gandhi said; at this point they’re fighting, and some of the peak oil community are starting to think about what victory might look like.<br><br>That’s a fair question. What <i>would</i> victory look like? Imagine for a moment that the arrival of permanently scarce energy became as much a part of the conventional wisdom in the decades ahead of us as it became, however briefly, in the 1970s. It would be easy enough to blow the dust off the plans and dreams of that latter decade, and there’s arguably a real point to doing that, but the world has changed; the reserves of fossil fuels that planners in the Seventies counted on to cushion the descent into a low-energy future have been severely depleted in the years since, and there are twice as many people on this small and crowded planet as there were back then. By any realistic measure, we’re in a heap of trouble, and the hope that a mass movement might yield enough enthusiasm and commitment to deal with that heap is an easy one to understand.<br><br>Still, that hope isn’t one I share. Quite the contrary, I’ve come to think that the rise of a mass movement centered on peak oil – whether or not it turns into the sort of revitalization movement discussed in the last two posts – might well put paid to any hope of avoiding a profoundly unwelcome future. The best way to explain that sense is an indirect one, and so I trust my readers will have patience with a divagation in the direction of Philadelphia.<br><br>I was there a little while back, speaking at a conference at a posh downtown hotel. I’ll spare you the details; it was one of those gigs that peak oil speakers dread, the sort of event where you’ve got twelve minutes in a panel discussion to explain why the future everyone has taken for granted isn’t going to happen, and why whatever plans they happen to be promoting need to make room for economic and social collapse, mass impoverishment, and the whole cheerful landscape of a deindustrializing world. Well before your twelve minutes are up, it’s clear that you might as well have spent the time reciting texts from the Iguvine Tablets in the original Umbrian; there’s a little polite applause, the audience asks a few polite questions, a few people come up to thank you for your speech, and none of the attendees mentions peak oil in your hearing again.<br><br>Afterwards, I ducked out of the hotel and walked the streets of downtown Philly, partly to find some comfortable dive for dinner, but mostly to shake off the sense of intellectual mummification that events like that always leave behind. A session of t’ai chi on the grass in Rittenhouse Square startled the pigeons and a couple of transients but left me feeling a good deal less numbed, and I did indeed find a comfortable dive (and had a good dinner there a bit later), but what turned the day around was a couple of lines written in fading gold lettering on a window in an otherwise undistinguished block of shops and offices, announcing to the world the Philadelphia branch of the <a href=http://www.ultphiladelphia.org/ >United Lodge of Theosophists</a>.<br><br>I suspect this phrase will mean nothing to most of my readers. The original Theosophical Society (TS) was founded back in 1875 in New York City by Helena Blavatsky, a Russian emigré, and a small circle of American mystics and occultists. Its purpose was to provide an alternative to the dogmatic religion and equally dogmatic scientific materialism of the day, and it offered public lectures and instruction at a time when most other esoteric spiritual groups kept their teachings hidden away behind tightly locked lodge doors. Other groups had tried to do the same thing in various ways for decades beforehand, but for some reason Theosophy caught on where these others failed, and found itself with local groups and a mass following on four continents.<br><br>Blavatsky, who by this time was the unquestioned leader of the movement, then found herself facing the same predicament that confronts every spiritual movement that attracts a large following Of those who joined the Society, only a small percentage were actually interested in studying the philosophy, practicing the spiritual practices, and making use of the rest of what it had to teach; the majority wanted to participate in it for what amounted to social reasons. She responded by reorganizing the TS, creating an Esoteric Section for those willing to commit to daily meditation and study, and using the rest of the Society as an outer court where those interested solely in the social aspects of a mass movement could take part and contribute whatever they could.<br><br>That structure stayed in place until Blavatsky died in 1891. The Society broke apart in the years that followed; most of the Theosophical groups that emerged from the confusion kept the same policy, but he largest of the fragments did not. Headed by suffragist and Fabian socialist Annie Besant, this branch – called the Adyar TS, after the location of its headquarters – pursued a mass following, and turned into a full-blown revitalization movement when Besant decided that a boy named Jiddu Krishnamurti, the son of a Hindu servant at the Adyar headquarters, was the next World Teacher, the successor of Buddha and Christ, who would lead the world to salvation under the banner of Theosophy.<br><br>In the short term, it was a hugely popular move; the claim that the Adyar TS had a messiah on hand who would shortly launch his career of redemption proved to be a membership magnet of immense power. Chapters of the Order of the Star in the West, an organization launched in 1911 to promote Krishnamurti, sprang up like mushrooms across much of the world. After the First World War, the implosion of Europe’s global ascendancy and the betrayal of wartime promises made the dream of a redeemer profoundly appealing. Meanwhile Krishnamurti grew to manhood, trained and prompted for the role he was expected to play. Finally, in 1929, a huge rally of the Order was summoned to be present as Krishnamurti formally began his career as World Teacher.<br><br>I sometimes wonder what must have gone through his mind as he mounted the podium that day and looked down at the ocean of upturned faces gazing at him in adoration. My readers might wish to imagine themselves in the same position. There you are, with tens of thousands of people eagerly awaiting your least word, and hundreds of thousands more around the world longing to receive the message you are about to give them. Will you call them to manifest your highest ideals, will you tell them to fulfill your basest desires, or will it be, as it usually is, a bit of both?<br><br>It’s an intoxicating image, but there’s another side to it. Not one of those tens of thousands of people has to be there; not one of the hundreds of thousands is required to listen. They are there for reasons of their own, reasons that mingle high ideals and base desires in the usual human proportions, and if the ideals or the desires you call on them to pursue are far enough from theirs that they see no way of fulfilling their own agendas by helping yours, they will turn away and go looking for another movement that shows more promise of giving them what they want. That’s the trap that waits for every mass movement that tries to change society, because the ideals and desires of the majority define the structure of society as it is; a would-be mass movement that pursues a different path will reliably find itself failing to attract members, while a mass movement that reshapes its message to attract a large audience will inevitably turn into a mechanism for replicating the existing order of things.<br><br>Whether this is what went through Krishnamurti’s mind is anyone’s guess, as he refused to talk about the experience later. Still, by the time he descended from the podium, the elaborate fantasy Besant and her colleagues had built around him, and the revitalization movement that had grown up around that, were blown to smithereens. Truth, he told his listeners, is a pathless land; no messiah can take you there, or lift the burden of thinking for yourself off your shoulders. In front of them all, he disavowed his role as World Teacher and dissolved the Order of the Star in the West. The mass movement popped like a bubble, and all the Theosophical organizations suffered huge drops in membership; Besant’s career was effectively over, though she lingered on for a few more years. Ironically, Krishnamurti went on to a long career as a spiritual teacher, but he steadfastly refused to allow any organization to form around him, and I don’t know of anybody who claims that he really was the World Teacher.<br><br>The peak oil scene is a long way from finding its Krishnamurti, or even its Annie Besant. Still, the future after peak oil is also a pathless land, and as the reality of limits to growth goes mainstream and peak oil speakers find audiences more responsive than the one I faced in Philadelphia, the trap that waits for all mass movements waits for it as well. A survey just splashed over the American media points up the difficulty: a large majority of Americans surveyed agreed that the energy situation was a crisis and something needs to be done, but very few of them were willing to accept a solution that involved gasoline prices going up. The temptation to promise people that they can have a green energy future and still fill their tanks for less than $3 a gallon will be immense; those groups that do this can count on being flooded with recruits, while those that admit that in any realistic green energy future, most Americans will no longer have cars at all, will find themselves in the same sort of situation I encountered at the conference in Philadelphia, trying to talk to people for whom the future might as well be written in Umbrian.<br><br>Now it’s easy to insist that getting people in the door is the important thing, and once they’re in the movement they can be led gradually to more accurate views. The history of mass movements shows otherwise with depressing consistency. The leaders who imagine themselves drawing the masses step by step to some better set of beliefs and behaviors generally find out the hard way, as their predecessors did, that they are the ones who will be drawn step by step into whatever set of beliefs and behaviors will maximize the size and influence of the movement they head – which amounts to whatever set of beliefs and behaviors the masses want them to have. We’ve already seen some parts of the peak oil scene moving in this direction; the insistence that an optimism that will attract crowds is more important than a realism that can guide a meaningful response comes to mind in this context.<br><br>The pursuit of a mass movement is not the only option we’ve got, fortunately, and other options – one of which I plan on exploring in detail in next week’s post, and in the weeks to come – offer a great deal more potential for viable change. Still, one of the simplest was on display in the quiet little library and meeting room of the Philadelphia United Lodge of Theosophists. The ULT stayed aloof from Annie Besant’s shenanigans, and has quietly continued to follow the original plan of the movement, offering lectures and opportunities for study to those who are willing to learn. I went there after dinner and took in a talk and a lively discussion about certain points of Theosophical teaching, and had a fine time. Druidry and Theosophy are by no means the same thing, but there’s enough common ground to make for congenial conversation, and you don’t come through the kind of traditional occult training I had back in my misspent youth without knowing your way around Theosophical ideas. When I walked back to the hotel that evening, the day felt a lot less like a waste.<br><br>Still, the moment that remains with me happened before the meeting, while I was chatting with some of the Theosophists. One elderly African-American man mentioned that a few years back, considering the state of the world, he and his wife had decided to give up their car. Of course, he admitted, it involved some changes, but Philly public transit got them where they needed to go, and he found that doing without the costs of car ownership left him with so much money left over at the end of the month that at first he kept checking to make sure he’d paid all his bills.<br><br>I thought about him as I took the train home the next day, and I also thought about the Amish family seated behind me on the train, father and the boys in white shirts and black hats, mother and the girls in bonnets and ankle-length dresses, talking quietly to each other in the German dialect everyone around here calls Pennsylvania Dutch. The lesson I took from them is that it’s the choices of individuals that ultimately make any difference that’s going to be made. It’s tempting to think that the social pressure of a mass movement can lead people to make changes they aren’t willing to make on their own, but in practice, that’s not the way it works; instead, what generally happens is that sooner or later, those who hoped to lead the world to some shining future en masse find themselves sitting in the smoking crater left by the total implosion of their dreams, wondering what happened. It would be unfortunate, to use no stronger word, to have that sort of fiasco replicated in the peak oil movement.

I think that they will be one of the groups that people will turn to after this luxurious style of life collapses. The only reason they even need money is to pay tax. Or so I have heard. My brother and I long thought of creating a Celtic Revival society that we named Caora Dubh, meaning Black Sheep. Our goal was to create a community that organized on celtic beliefs and research, as people visit to learn these ways they would find the sustainable style of community life appealing and hopefully find themselves settling in our community and teaching others as well.<br><br><a href=#c4695382744415595559 title="comment permalink">6/23/10, 8:55 PM</a><br><br>

I live a few blocks west of the National Headquarters for the Theosophical Society, which is oddly located in one of the most religious (Christian) towns of the United States. They have always fascinated me, and I was happy to see you post about Theosophy. In fact, I just mailed some of their brochures to a fellow Druid in Idaho. Their teachings were far too esoteric for me, as a young boy, but I always respected them because they also are housed in a town that is so fundamentally Christian that the local college bans dancing and drinking. It offered me a way, growing up, to see an alternative way of thought. <br><a href=http://www.theosophical.org/national_center/index.php rel=nofollow>Theosophical Society in America</a><br><br><a href=#c1356689609371430829 title="comment permalink">6/23/10, 9:17 PM</a><br><br>

Unfortunate though it may be, isn't this just something that we really need to plan around, assuming that whatever terminology we might use (such as the very term "peal oil") will likely get co-opted and probably then discredited, in the mass mind? It would seem to me that the hard work will be keeping the fundamentals clear in our own heads, avoiding being confused and disoriented by the winds of movements blowing this way and that. <br><br>As anyone who has ever travelled overland without the aid of a path can tell you, it is important to remain keenly aware of your surroundings, mindful of the terrain, cautious about the hazards, and always willing to adjust your planned route in response to new information, changed circumstances, and surprises encountered on the way.

People are concerned about the affect of burning all that brown coal in power stations for electricity generation, yet consistently in polls few people would pay extra to revamp the power generation infrastructure to a more renewable and/or less polluting source.<br><br>Even worse, the powers that be pursue the dream of clean coal as a mantra. Even if it was technically feasible, people don't realise that adding another layer of processing, infrastructure and storage in the electricity generation process can only increase the cost of the electricity generated.<br><br>Your post this week also put me in mind of the US governments budget which runs in near constant deficit. <br><br>The effectiveness of a democracy is lost once the clamour of competing interests drown out common sense and long term vision. Especially when the representative members can pretty much only publicly support the ideals that will get them put back in their seat for another term. Tax cuts are much more appealing than higher fuel or food prices. You can't please everyone, but at some point in history the very wealthy start throwing their resources behind maintaining the status quo. At this point meaningful reforms become impossible to implement. I would say that in Australia we are entering (or have entered) this time. For those that are interested, the government is trying to implement a new tax on the profits of the mining industry. Interesting times.<br><br>Movements I reckon, are feel good things. It's interesting when you write that the vast majority of people join for purely social reasons and I have to agree as I've noticed this happens in groups here. This in itself is no bad thing, but it effects little in the way of real change. As they say talk is cheap...<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><a href=#c8384722309157301208 title="comment permalink">6/24/10, 2:30 AM</a><br><br>

To me it's simply a set of protocols. You can adopt them to get things moving in your local area, or ditch them if you don't work. Two things that interest me minimally are a) What TTs distant from me are doing, or whether it resembles what I'm doing, and b) What TTs are 'supposed to do'. But then I'm not a meetings guy either, as I mentioned last week.<br><br>In my local area TTers attend draught-busting workshops and worm-composting demonstrations, organize allotments and garden swaps... things like that. Growing your own food, reskilling, and getting to know your community -- in fact precisely what's talked about here so often. I don't feel involved in a big 'network' at all. As a result I find the disdain occasionally expressed for TT as a 'mass movement' to be a little overdone.<br><br>In the UK, at any rate, the chances of TT coming together under one big Annie Besant-style message seem very slim to me.

Not me for certain.<br><br>I remember from your <i>Encyclopedia</i>, JMG, that you thought Krishnamurti's rejection of his designated-messiah status an act of great courage -- personally, I don't think so. He did become a guru for the rest of his life anyway, after all. After having proclaimed truth a 'pathless land', he went on preaching his own truth very didactically just the same, and was just as much a guru as if he had been still involved in Theosophy, which I think he principally junked because the spirits it put him in touch with misled him in his opinion.<br><br><a href=#c7324448433104337467 title="comment permalink">6/24/10, 2:33 AM</a><br><br>

That's why it's crucial that at least some peak oil people stay aloof from nascent mass movements and maintain alternate perspectives in public. <br><br>Nebris, that's classic Krishnamurti. <br><br>Onion, that's exactly the strategy I've been suggesting. <br><br>Brad, the rise (and fall) of Victorian morality happened on a grassroots level; there was no organized mass movement involved. <br><br>Wolf, that's the way. <br><br>Kevin, I have the same response to Lovins' take on things.

It's just not usually a good way to make change happen. <br><br>Jason, as I said, it's early days yet for the Transition Town movement. Its great weakness is that its fixation on optimism makes it raise expectations it can't possibly fulfill; the question that hasn't been settled yet is what happens to it once that becomes obvious. As for Krishnamurti, well, to each their own; I think you're massively underestimating him and his work. <br><br>Cherokee, as I've said repeatedly, I have no problem at all with the ideas of permaculture; it's purely some of the ways it's taken shape as a social movement that give me pause. <br><br>Knitter, if your local Masons are telling you what to think, they've lost touch with some of the core principles of the Craft. As for your local TT group, it's entirely possible that things might turn out well; it's the lack of attention to the possible downside that troubles me most about that.<br><br>Divelly, good. I think one of the main things that sank the communes of the late Sixties was the fixation on endless meetings; you can only do that so long before fleeing becomes the best option. <br><br>Don, thank you!

WWII turned around the Great Depression.<br><br>The Vietnam War turned a defense and militarily oriented nation to generations of knee-jerk repugnance of guns, authority, and defense. (As in the Brady Bunch wanting to make themselves safer by disarming victims. Not that I have any particular thoughts on that.)<br><br>Bresant and Blavatsky fought duel monsters - mainstream religion and science, portrayed as blinkered forces that run over obstacles.<br><br>Politicians use the BEM argument all the time - as in B. Hussein Obama's call for tap and tax, because the BP oil well blew out in the Gulf of Mexico. Al Gore tried to ride global warming to political prominence (witness the celebrated lack of consciousness about his personal home). Climate-gate did nothing to diminish global warming. Instead, Climate-gate denounced the hubris of those clearly manipulating the BEM call (with climate change as the BEM). By defeating the initial BEM charge, climate change was relegated to just one more, among many competing mundane priorities and causes of the day.<br><br>Right now, presently, at this hour, there is nothing on the news compelling enough to emotionally outweigh whatever snippets and perspectives and persuasions that occupy the mainstream media "news"-for-entertainment channels. Today we are angry about this, this evening about that - whatever happens to be top place on the news. Unless you live near the Gulf of Mexico, or are impacted as businesses in the area fail and start impacting other businesses, products, and consumers on an ever-widening wave front of direct and indirect impact - you might be focused instead on whether Congress represents the will of America, or whether those that manage to accumulate money (or energy) deserve to be punitively taxed. (Don't you love the Christian preaching about "money is the root of all evil - give us a chunk of yours to spread the message and do good?")<br><br>JMG, I am not sure if the Church's message in the Victorian age created the topic, stumbled onto it, or cribbed it from someone else (like much of their teaching). But the Victorian message about skin and sex being the tool of the devil certainly provided the BEM the church needed to preserve vestiges of their demonizing of casual nudity until even modern times.<br><br>Plagues among crowed and dirty cities in the past have driven exoduses to the country side, for the rich and those with the means to flee. Wars provide a focus that brings nations together. The US military has long been a socially active, unifying social engineering force for American society, imposing tolerance for those from differing backgrounds and social strata, providing social mobility to various individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, all in the name of defending the nation.<br><br>Peak Oil is based on an understanding of the specter in the wings. It might be clear to the knowledgeable that 2005 was the tipping point - but not clear at all, to those with bigger BEM's on their plate this morning.<br><br>It seems that the BEM that would drive the world, as well as America, into a reasoned, effective response to Peak Oil hasn't yet arrived. The deceptive use of warnings of what is to come, portrayed as actual BEM sightings, have nearly de-fanged this BEM's ability to arouse and motivate. Today the incidental harbingers of the BEM are counted as the BEM itself; we get a politician having a meeting or making a statement, and write each off as "handled", just like so very many contrived political "dangers" topics.<br><br>The knowledgeable, I expect, will continue to prioritize their lives in ways that seem best to them. The vasty hordes, I expect, will continue to yield to the fickle social pressures that move populations hither and thither - until the next BEM rears its ugly head.<br><br><a href=#c4390319554704415262 title="comment permalink">6/24/10, 7:48 AM</a><br><br>

The “what happens after peak oil?” question is of course massively complex and uncertain and unknowable, and I appreciate your measured and focused discussion of one or two angles each week. Thanks for putting in the time that you do.<br><br>I like the phrase “pathless land” very much. I’ve always hoped and sometimes believed that I follow some sort of path through life, but the path wanders a lot, as I adjust to the things I encounter on the way. So I don’t expect anyone to follow the same path as me, and of course a mass group of folks won’t be able to follow one another, in a reasonably orderly way, down a rough path of rapidly descending material expectations. I don’t believe that even the strongest and clearest leadership we could hope for will be sufficient to prevent chaos down that path. A leader’s vision is often an illusion, and that isn’t helpful when trying to accept reality. <br><br>As I have started to adjust my own expectations over the last few years, the anxiety and confusion one feels can be very intense. It’s not pleasant, and initially didn’t bring out the most rational side of me. But it’s something we’ll each have to go through, with no guarantee of success. A key factor will be the amount of time we have to adjust, which will vary again depending on our individual circumstances. Hopefully enough individuals will find enough time to adjust and find their own way through. I suspect the beneficial role of mass movements will be the signposts they can provide to individuals on the way, in terms of information and tools and good and bad examples of various sorts. We’ll see what happens, I suppose.<br><br><a href=#c2965927509181746249 title="comment permalink">6/24/10, 8:43 AM</a><br><br>

Today's post really struck a chord with me and I felt compelled to post a comment. <br><br>"A Pathless Land" as a pronouncement of our future is a discouraging prospect. We are social animals and there is an innate need to "find our tribe". <br><br>Yesterday there was an open thread on The Oil Drum entitled "The Road Not Taken" discussing the event of President Carter placing solar panels on the White House in 1979 and President Reagan removing them in 1986. I had assumed that 30 years later we could easily see the folly of the refusal to accept limits. Even on a progressive forum such as TOD there was little consensus. <br><br>The framing of Carter as a "bumbling incompetent" was in fresh display. Opinions are now valued more than facts. There was hope that President Obama would be that leader who would lead America to a brighter promise. Now many are disillusioned that he is only a politician and a mere man with feet of clay.<br><br>What is clear is in the absence of leaders and national movements there will be very little done to mitigate the existential disaster coming with Peak Oil and the "Tragedy of the Commons".<br><br>The Peak Oil and transition movements aren't looking for Messiahs. They are however looking for leaders around which to organize effective strategies. The reluctance to follow dangerous political paths isn't courageous nor inspiring...in fact it is quite the opposite.<br><br>"The full round, the norm of the mono-myth, requires that the hero shall now begin the labor of bringing the runes of wisdom, the Golden Fleece, or his sleeping princess, back into the kingdom of humanity, where the boon may redound to the renewing of the community, the nation, the planet, or the ten thousand worlds."<br><br>Joseph Campbell, "Hero With A Thousand Faces" Return: Refusal of the Return<br><br>Joe<br><br><a href=#c3298172186881831159 title="comment permalink">6/24/10, 9:16 AM</a><br><br>

A Kibbuz was quite ok or the Eden Obstbaugesellschaft but they failed because they were too enthusiastic that they can overcome the "human condition". People do not want to spend their whole live on ONE system. They want work time and leisure time and hollidays and service times. That needs to be accepted. Having a meal with the entire cooperation every time like the amish do is not really applicable. We need more social research on that issue.

(Robert Howard's Conan the Barbarian, for example, swaggered and fought his way through an imaginary past almost entirely based on Blavatsky's writings.)<br><br>Andy, that is indeed one of the big questions.

I have heard this repeatedly from my mother growing up, and it seems to pop up all the time in the collapse/peak oil arena as well. I actually have come to look at it as exactly the type of false 'revitalization' hope these essays are addressing.<br><br>I have grown up on a hobby farm in central PA with both Amish and Mennonite neighbors. I've played with their children when young and maintained personal and business contacts to this day. I have some knowledge of their ways and customs, but am far from an expert.<br><br>Their community suffers the effects of cheap energy and globalization as badly as the rest of us. They provide very little for themselves. Most don't farm anymore, but work in our 'English' society either as labor, or self employed in a family business. <br>They do maintain gardens, forego modern convenience in their homes, (barns and business are different, and often have electricity, lighting, and everything modern) and sew their own clothes, but are in the grocery store and Walmart with the rest of us, and get their fabric from China. They do know more than most of us and there is a lot to be learned, but most of the old ways are gone. <br><br>I was talking to an Amish gentleman who built a beautiful french door for me. His shop has all the same industrial machinery and electricity that you would expect, and he knows nothing about production with old hand tools etc. We were talking about all the lost knowledge and he agreed.He said, for example, that all the 'old ones' that knew how to raise a barn and do timber frame joinery have passed, and none of the young were interested enough to keep it going. New buildings are built exactly the same as anywhere else in the country, often with electrical from the grid, or a generator to run the power tools.<br><br>While I have no issue whatsoever with their way of life, their 'simple' lifestyle is total social engineering designed to reduce jealousy in the community. The church decides what is acceptable and everyone stays roughly the same. (no 'keeping up with the Jones's') It has nothing to do with avoiding the latest tools, materials, and techniques to get the job done easier. They are arguably a little better off than the rest of us, but they will suffer the same if things get hard. What if they can't light their homes with propane, heat their houses with oil, and run their farm machinery with gas/diesel? No one tans leather for horse harness (China). No one blacksmiths replacement parts for their field equipment (China). No one makes lumber without gasoline. <br><br>I just want to dispel the 'hope' that the Amish will be able to teach us much to help us. Nothing different than your grandmother could have really.<br><br>...of course, different communities elsewhere could be different. Many Amish families are moving to Mexico.<br><br>Their biggest asset is their strong community. And that wont really help 'us' unless we learn from it and build our own.<br><br>sorry to post a book for my first submittal :-)<br><br><a href=#c2962739169031474072 title="comment permalink">6/24/10, 10:22 AM</a><br><br>

For instance, Transition already faces an uphill battle as it deals with the preexisting bright-green groups that have already staked their territory. I faced this problem in my town.<br><br>You think Transition is too optimistic, you should check out the prior generation of environmental groups that advocate nothing more than screwing in CFLs and turning down the thermostat!<br><br>Why should we have two or three environmental groups all stepping on each other's toes? At some point you have to decide if you can't beat em, join em. That seems to be what has become of the post-carbon institute lately.<br><br>Is that really a bad thing?<br><br>I have my own reservations about TT, but I simply have NOTHING BETTER to support. Do you? Should we just sit around passively and wait for some other movement to come around which satisfies all our wants and needs? Do we really have the time for that?<br><br>Considering the "frog in the pot" theory, sitting around waiting for the neighbors to feel pressured enough to panic and desperately tear up their lawn to plant seeds is not my idea of a recipe for success. That is what my definition of "muddling through" is. It's people having a death-bed conversion, and jumping into a survival strategy totally clueless and with the odds seriously stacked against them.<br><br>It's very easy to criticize and nit-pick. It's a lot harder to actually build something from the ground up. I think Transition should be commended for what it's accomplished so far, at least in the UK. It's starting to gain a lot of credibility as an organization. And that is extremely important when the locals evaluate whether what you're trying to do. You are starting with the momentum of the rest of the organization to back you up rather than just your own individual charisma (or lack thereof). You can whip out videos from existing transition movements to show what it's all about. It's a powerful calling-card.<br><br>Sometimes I think peakers have become a little too comfortable with the lay of the land. The idea of everything coalescing into a single movement threatens the status quo of peakdom being this amorphous clique of whiney social critics and isolated individual preppers twiddling their thumbs anxiously awaiting TEOTAWKI. The schadenfreude club.<br><br>If peak oil and prepping actually goes mainstream, then all the peakers lose their status as feeling smarter than everyone else, of being ahead of the curve. Far better to keep all this stuff underground, right? I really think some of that feeds into some of the overly-eager nit-picking of Transition that I read here and elsewhere. A lot of people are looking real hard for a reason to REJECT Transition and go back to being the grumpy blogger/commenter rather than trying to find a role to play to help it along.<br><br>This is the selection bias that I see when I surf the doom blogosphere. The most active transition people aren't the ones posting comments here or under Sharon Astyk's site. They aren't posting on peakoil.com or LATOC. Heck, they aren't even posting that much on the Transition NING sites. They are working in their local groups and so they are invisible to the larger internet peaker virtual community.<br><br>So I think if you want to find things to complain about, you'll always find _something_. And if that's the criteria you use to determine whether to endorse something, you'll never endorse anything and we'll just spiral all the way down to every-man-for-himself lifeboat ethics.<br><br>And if the internet is still up we can trade stories about how many zombies we plugged each day.<br><br><a href=#c8056548826122413791 title="comment permalink">6/24/10, 11:03 AM</a><br><br>

Usually, it's a variation on the theme of, "How'd you get those tomato plants to grow so big?" One thing inevitably leads to another, and we'll end up showing them one of our square-foot gardening books or the plans for the self-watering earthtainers, or discussing soil pH or how to deal with those @#$%&amp; gophers. Quite a few of our neighbors are growing, or at least starting to grow, small gardens of their own, and most of the rest are thinking about it. This is very encouraging.<br><br>We are not shy about telling everyone the main reason why we are doing this. Sure, gardening is a great hobby, and the food does taste better than those square tomatoes at Safeway, but the main reason is because we need to learn how to be more self-sufficient in the event of, well, you know... <br><br>But here's the interesting part: almost everyone we've talked to is aware of the concept of Peak Oil, and they all know that our fossil-fueled way of life is basically unsustainable, and they are interested in learning how to grow their own food because they suspect that they are going to have to learn how sooner or later (that is, if they want to keep eating after the delivery trucks stop arriving at the local supermarkets).<br><br>Nobody has a clue as to when or how civilization as we know it is going to fall apart, but they're all aware that things are slowly sliding out of control. Thanks to news about the Gulf oil spill, the growing national debt, and similar current events, everyone (and I mean EVERYONE) we talk to is growing more and more concerned about the shape of the future for them and their children and grandchildren. They seem to know, at some subliminal level, that things are just going to keep getting worse, and there probably aren't going to be any magic bullets.<br><br>So, we don't need no stinkin' meetings to find like-minded people and talk about the kinds of things that the archdruid writes about.

Long time reader here, first time poster.<br><br>I have a question for Mr. Greer. joemichaels' question reminded me of something I wondered after reading last week's blog. I was thinking of incantory magical examples from the history of my consciousness of the energy issue, and it occurred to me that both Carter's placement of the solar panels and Reagan's removal of them fit your definition. They both were done far more for their symbolic value than for anything tangible they accomplished. The difference is that Mr. Carter's action would probably be considered a weak one, and indeed, was widely viewed as such at the time (I remember some wag pointing out that the acronym for Carter's term "Moral Equivalent of War" was MEOW.) Reagan's action, though, strikes me as very powerful. He very unequivocally let it be known from the start he would brook no talk of limits and that pretty much set the tone of every administration to follow.<br><br>My question is: Are negative actions (in the literal sense, not making a judgment about this one, though the consequences should be clear by now) necessarily more powerful than positive ones? I can see intuitively that it would be a LOT harder to make a positive piece of magic work. I'm thinking you generally have to make something happen that wouldn't otherwise. On the other hand, a negative effect can be had any number of ways, anything that stops something.<br><br>Or did Reagan just have stronger juju?<br><br>I would think this would have a strong influence on the ability of the transition or any other initiatives to have a positive effect.<br><br><a href=#c625012221006934897 title="comment permalink">6/24/10, 1:14 PM</a><br><br>

The regular folks here are not that far removed from their roots in the dirt. All the signs I see among the general people (not the green movement) are that their concerns are with being able to grow food (as well as smoke and ingredients for brew, of course) and keep a roof over everyone's head. I expect the community will naturally tighten as suburban money-based "self-sufficiency" becomes less and less practical. We saw suggestions of this in our 1000-year flood last month -- the community self-organized and mobilized even before the water was down and the dead were buried. In th emuch longer term, when the energy problems really come home, I don't think we'll see people flocking to the Transition Town meetings or $1000 Permaculture workshops, nor to church anymore than they already do. In recent years when the gas prices have soared and "OUT OF GAS" signs have appeared on station pumps, people didn't make a run on the Green Cafe Evenings. They made a run on the Mall*Wart, the local nurseries, and the Amish markets for gardening and canning supplies.<br><br><a href=#c5173688919381017596 title="comment permalink">6/24/10, 1:41 PM</a><br><br>

They're wealthy because they can sell their crops; who do they sell them to, and how are they transported? Lots of questions to ask here). This leaves aside the fact that the Amish have the same dark underbelly that everyone else does. The couple behind you on the train may have been quaint, but Amish communities are also afflicted by sexual abuse and domestic violence, as I know from first-hand reports; they're just closed enough that few people outside will ever know about it. <br><br>The problem is that your anecdotal and oblique praise of the Amish amounts to the presentation of Amishness as a solution, and an individual one at that.<br><br>In all, I have a predictable reaction against the tenor of this post. "A social response to a social problem is impossible; only an individual response will mean anything. There is no social action anyway; there are only individual actions which together make up society." You sound disturbingly like Margaret Thatcher here -- "there is no such thing as society; there are only individuals." I can say quite simply and directly that this is wrong and wrong-headed.<br><br>History affords us abundant examples of social delusion. However, history also affords us abundant examples of effective social action. Is it really time to give up hope and retreat?

I have no idea whether people will be heading back to medieval garments, or loincloths, or whatever -- predicting the future of energy is hard enough; predicting the future of fashion is impossible!<br><br>Mill, granted. Leigh Brackett many years ago wrote an SF novel in which a post-nuclear war USA adopted Amish and Mennonite lifestyles en masse, but that's hardly a viable option; I mentioned the Amish family behind me on the train as an example of a group of people who have done what they thought was right, without waiting for a mass movement to fix the world for them. <br><br>Wendy, thanks for the reminder!<br><br>Straker, you're getting well into the yellow range of my troll-ometer with this comment. Ad hominem insults that attribute the worst motives to those you disagree with are not a helpful contribution to a conversation, and doing more of that will get you shown the door. <br><br>In response to the substantive part of your comment, though, why is signing up for a movement the only alternative you can see to sitting on your hands? I've discussed many other alternatives here, and will be focusing on another in the weeks to come. <br><br>Pgrass, getting ready for austerity is one of the best things you can do right now. Another is to embrace austerity before you have to, so you know how to do it with some degree of skill and comfort.<br><br>Tristan, nah, it was around long before Allen. <br><br>Moose, that's excellent news -- both that people are interested, as that they're tuning in. The strategy you're practicing is central to what I'll be talking about in upcoming posts. <br><br>Hal, positive actions can be just as strong as negative ones, but Carter simply wasn't that good of a magician. If he'd been less out of his depth as president, he might have been able to seize the initiative, transform the collective conversation, and make sustainability seem not merely necessary but desirable. I grant that he tried, but he didn't have the mojo to do it. <br><br>Tom, good heavens. Half of my remaining respect for Lovins just went out the window. Whether somebody gets burned to death in an explosion or a deflagration won't matter much to their next of kin. <br><br>Bill, that seems quite logical. <br><br>Rudi, on the one hand, I'm not presenting Amishness as any kind of answer -- you're reading that in. (See my earlier response to Mill Lee Farm.) On the other, where do you get the idea that joining a social movement is the only alternative to giving up hope and retreating? That sort of false and forced dichotomy is sloppy thinking at best. <br><br>K, that's well worth reading. Thank you for the link. Mainstream, here we come!<br><br>Joel, by all means save the swales. <br><br>Nox Populi, agreed. <br><br>James, that's also a consideration. <br><br>Nicholas, your best bet as far as potatoes is to check with local gardeners and people who have root cellars; I've never lived in that area so don't know the climate and conditions. As for bicycles, that would require a post of its own, but the short form is probably not once we get past the salvage stage. <br><br>Michael, you're talking apples and oranges. I've already pointed out that organized social movements seeking specific, achievable changes that the majority either favors or is willing to tolerate can, in at least some cases, accomplish something. If the nascent mass movements in the peak oil scene were pushing for goals like that, I'd be much less worried about them. As it is, they're making sweeping promises they can't possibly fulfill, and being very, very vague about how they expect to get there. There's also far too much of the attitude expressed by several commenters here -- that joining the movement du jour is the only alternative to sitting on your hands and giving up all hope. Those signs tell me that something has gone very much amiss.<br><br><a href=#c8511845780545552974 title="comment permalink">6/24/10, 4:23 PM</a><br><br>

To say that all human action takes place in relation to community, while quite true, does not mean that the particular form of ersatz community manufactured by mass movements of the specific kind I discussed -- the sort that pursue membership at the expense of message -- is always, or ever, the best available option. <br><br>Petro, granted. What makes the current situation interesting is that -- like the economic crisis, or the BP oil spill -- what starts off as a crazy worst-case scenario only discussed on the fringe seems to keep turning into the best assessment of the situation, and the allegedly reasonable claims made by allegedly reasonable people keep on being exposed as so much handwaving. I'm not sure how Cassandra would have done if she kept on scoring hit after hit after hit...<br><br>Cherokee, thanks for the clarification. Your comparison of villages and apartment complexes makes a good point; systems, social as well as ecological, that evolve over time are generally more viable and less prone to disaster than those that are cobbled together in a hurry -- and especially than those that are cobbled together in accordance with some abstract notion of what the system ought to be.<br><br><a href=#c2252315967043011432 title="comment permalink">6/24/10, 7:06 PM</a><br><br>

I am quite involved in several communities, both local and regional (and yes I do mean real, live, in-person human beings, I'm not counting the internet). Being active in your community can take many, many forms other than pursuing a cause or promoting a message. Does the garden club have a worldview it is trying to promote? Not in general, no. But can it be a place for people to share ideas and knowledge that is useful both now and if/when the energy manure hits the fan? You betcha! Am I not being involved in my community when I talk to my neighbors and the operator of the small commercial egg farm up the road (as a NEIGHBOR, not as an organizer) about animal keeping practices and the challenges of finding markets for local farm produce? Am I not being a valuable community member when I buy and move in to a beloved but neglected 19th century farmhouse (that appears to have at one time housed an aunt of everyone in the county), and bring it back to life one board at a time? Does being a NOAA Storm Spotter not count as a valuable community service?

One of the best features of the transition town approach, at least so far, has been its efforts to grapple with real communities. One of the many problems with mass movements is that they tend to replace such on-the-ground communities with an ersatz community of participants in the movement, from which "outsiders" -- no matter how local they happen to be -- are increasingly excluded. You've noted examples of that in the transition scene where you are; I hope it doesn't spread. <br><br>Ric, a while back I saw an article -- I've lost the reference -- that claims that PowerPoint has a large role in a lot of the really bad decisions of recent years.

A case were the path entailed murdering the director of Carnegie Steel, Henry Clay Frick, thereby galvanizing the workers and avenging the state sponsored deaths of the Homestead strikers. The reality however turned out to be quite different. They tried to read the historical facts thought they understood them and proceeded with no small amount of hubris to pull history in the direction they thought it should go.

I think the "There is no brighter future" is a start, but not as functional as it might be as an incantation. It really depends on what you define as a brighter future after all, and what your purposes are in the incantation. <br><br>I'd worry that as it stands, it runs a real risk of producing 'learned helplessness' responses. There's always a contingent anyways that thinks being numb, being blind to the problem, etc., is the only thing left. If there is no option but defeat, why bother?<br><br>I'd look rather to the suggestions made by happiness studies lately that point to our happiness as a culture lagging severely behind our material wealth. People just don't seem to be any happier with more stuff, more options, etc. after a very limited point. Basics do need to be covered for happiness, but our basics aren't really what we usually think they are.<br><br>So I guess I'd propose (if you will please pardon the considerable hubris!) an alternative sort of incantation - Less Really Is More. It still innoculates against a great number of potential stupidities, while giving people something productive to be doing - without further damaging the planet, it doesn't promote complexity or fluff, and it isn't quite so depressing. (note that it doesn't particularly encourage meetings, bumper stickers, etc., either - I really do abhor most meetings)<br><br>To me, it seems like this would lead to such choices as the gentleman and the Amish in your post have made. Even if it can't 'fix' the problem, it at least promotes some functional thought about it, instead of paralysis. Maybe it could even promote some actual life changes. It is self-reinforcing after all, if one accepts the premise that most folks are usually a bit happier when they begin to reduce their reliance on too much of everything. And self-reinforcing habits have a better chance of survival than those that induce avoidance.<br><br><a href=#c8288095626174466450 title="comment permalink">6/25/10, 8:30 AM</a><br><br>

I'd be very interested in a discussion of the sort you've outlined, though the most likely outcome would be the same as that of the blog debate -- no resolution, just a greater clarity concerning where the lines of division can be traced. The split between those who approve of the Transition movement and those who don't is real, it goes down to core issues, and I don't think it would be to anyone's benefit to patch over it or pretend it isn't there. <br><br>Nancy, directing that $1 million to the Aboriginal people sounds like a very good idea indeed!<br><br>Hapibeli, yes, there's always the political dimension -- a problem all the more likely to balloon out of control if it's ignored. <br><br>Jason, I haven't read that bit by Vance, and obviously need to!

Notice, in this context, that you're assuming that the only alternative to a brighter future is defeatism and despair. Why is that? Most people, through most of human history, have gotten along just fine and found plenty of reasons to live even though they didn't believe in the fantasy that the future was by definition going to be better than the present.

Initially I thought "cool," but over the years I have seen what they actually do and do not, how they conduct business, the sorts of people from the pre-existing local community they attract and don't attract, their online writings and in-person presentations, and the gestalt of what they consider valuable and what they ignore. My opinions are based entirely on this.

That's a broader reflection of the way that a mass movement so often shifts from addressing an issue to being an issue, with its supporters becoming convinced that supporting the movement equals dealing with its ostensible purpose, while its critics too often get drawn into a mirroring stance and spending more time critiquing the movement than offering alternatives.

That's 150 people. Some years ago now, I visited Twin Oaks, one of the largest and best publicized survivors of the Vietnam War era intentional community movement. The group was then constructing what they intended to be their last unit of housing; wanting to clear Dunbar's number by a large margin, they were capping membership at 100. <br><br>I was told there that the number called Dunbar's was actually discovered centuries earlier through trial and error by the Hutterites (the exception that proves the rule regarding planned societies; it was founded in the 16th century, with the design coming out of the earliest participants' Bible studies, came through many experiences of persecution, and is today thriving). They wanted to create a society where labor contribution was on the honor system with no coercion. They found that, at populations of below 150, it worked because slacking felt like ripping off family and friends, while at above 150 slacking became significant because people felt like they were ripping off an impersonal collective authority. This was word of mouth, so I can't offer any verification for it, but it matches up with my intuition.<br><br><a href=#c5226583891209727159 title="comment permalink">6/25/10, 2:35 PM</a><br><br>

And that maybe where John's medieval social structures start revealing itself as guilds.<br><br>At any rate I intend to do what I can to ensure as many people as I can manage to have references that can be used to create their own paths in an era of declining energy resources. I'll be buying more and more how-to books to put in my personal library for seekers to use in mastering skills they can support themselves with. For all of us it will be learn as you go.<br><br>Will the transition be rough? Of course it will! We're a big bunch of pampered babies and honestly most of us have NEVER had to work as hard as our G'grandparents did. The party is over and we're going to be having a big hangover, the systemic problems caused by too much of a good time revealed by blisters, sore backs and a persistent chorus of 'Poor me! Why me?'<br><br>As far as transition towns and the people trying to organize for the fall off the peak, we've already made party clothes out of our parachute, the best we can do now is keep our feet together, arms tucked to our sides and go in feet first. Then our arms can get to work pulling us up to the surface where we learn how to become a duck.

And here, your criticisms of our culture are spot on, from my point of view. In fact, you are the only person to write about modern economics that I've come across that makes sense of all the BS that passes for economics now days. Plus you are a swell writer. Bravo! <br><br>My perspective varies from yours a bit though in that from my point of view the vast majority of problems we face are due to the fact that almost all of us are asleep at the wheel - so to speak - with fierce attachments to delusions, identities, defense mechanisms, cherished beliefs, desires, hopes, fears, addictions (emotional as well as substantial) and other "veils" that obscure our ability to perceive the truth both inside and out. No wonder we're driving over a cliff, collectively. Any new social, energy or political plan would merely be a reshuffling of the deck of shadows instead of waking up and walking out of the cave into the light of day (to use Plato's metaphor in a mixed sorta way). Some call it enlightenment, but to me it just seems to be the most obvious and ultimately practical response to the insanity of ego that is the norm here on earth. In fact, J. Krishnamurti's writing helped me start down this path.<br><br>All that said, here's an interesting video on a new water-powered car the Japanese have created. I've heard of these before, but they always seem to go nowhere - at least here in the US. Perhaps they're bought out and hidden away (see above reference to attachments ;))?

Today, though, when we have mass communication and propaganda and a crowded world with declining resources the effects can be alarming. Maybe at a Nuremberg rally a rational person could have found the posturing of the leaders laughable but surely the attitude of the FOLLOWERS would undoubtedly have been terrifying.<br>Humans in groups can do strange and unexpected things. Something that now makes me cringe with embarassment is the memory that one Saturday afternoon as an enthusiastic teenager I ran with a crowd of lefties through the streets of a nothern English town shouting 'the workers united will never be defeated'. It must have surprised the shoppers! I did it because I was persuaded that this was a good response to the recent election of an alleged neo-fascist to the local council. I was made to feel guilty if I didn't respond. Looking back it was a rather pointless thing to do but throughout it all I personally meant well and had the best of intentions. Shortly afterwards I was the founder member of both a workers' co-op and a housing co-op (still in existence) and had plenty of opportunities to see group dynamics in action.<br>As a result I was very encouraged when I saw initial TT documents that seemed to show a keen awareness of the problems of groups. For example a recommendation that initial founding groups in each locality should 'plan their own demise' and let the local organisation 'go where it wants to go'. Unfortunately the authors of this document did not follow their own advice and instead set up a centralised organisation with its own brandname. I don't know what to expect next from this organisation! For example, a couple of weeks ago at a UK Transition conference, four youngsters from midWales launched a 'Transition International Youth' project. (Details on the conference blog.) Why would a movement focussing on localisation want an international youth project? Surely an international youth project would be preceded by local, regional and national youth projects? Surely for a international project you need members from a wider area than one small part of Wales? My guess is that someone was worried that an uncontrolled youth organisation might arise somewhere else. My point is that the group has now taken over both its leaders and its followers.<br>I have always liked the thinking of anarchists and taoists with respect to groups and the most wisdom I have ever read in one place about the subject is in Ursula K LeGuin's 'The Dispossessed'.<br><br><a href=#c3026577871707049010 title="comment permalink">6/26/10, 1:20 AM</a><br><br>

The only major energy drawback is the need for an elevator - unless you don't mind a walk-up (not good for the frail or old folks). I don't care much for apartment buildings, but there are some that are esthetically okay. They're fine for urban density with easy walking distances.

Some have lasted for quite a while however. I live in one of them, one that's been around since the 1970s. There are advantages and disadvantages to communal arrangements, if some newcomer mentions the word "utopia" here we all have a laugh, but the advantages are enough for a certain subset of us to keep them going. I don't claim intentional communities are for everyone, but they can be viable.<br><br>Those of us with a lot of experience of intentional communities can often recognise ones that are bound to fail. Look through the listings at www.ic.org and you'll find tons of ones where one or two people list themselves as a community and are trying to attract people, they're usually bound to fail for a number of different reasons, all the successful ones that I know how they started started with a group of at least four people, often much more. That way, the land and infrastructure was the community's from the beginning, rather than there being an initial founding couple that thinks they want a community but really when it comes down to it they still want too much control for it to work.<br><br>Then there's the ones that have such an exact vision that unless they got followers nobody else would share it so exactly.<br><br>There's also the cohousing communities, many of which are successful but are often really just a development with a common house.<br><br>However, once you weed out most of them, you'll find a number of successful communities that really do have s different social arrangement. No, none of them are utopias, although some were founded on utopian ideals but got more realistic later, which I think counteracts the claim that utopian movements invariably either lead to nowhere or end in disaster. Some just adapt and become more realisitic. We have problems, yes, but for those of us who prefer the communities, it's still the better deal for us.<br><br>All in all, having the communal option around for those who desire it I think goes well with JMG's point on dissensus, many people trying out different ways and occupying different niches.<br><br><a href=#c2123209605836173527 title="comment permalink">6/26/10, 11:38 AM</a><br><br>

As I've mentioned here before, I think the basic ideas of permaculture are good, my quibbles are purely with the way it's taken shape (here in the US -- I don't have any direct contact with its forms in other countries) as a social phenomenon. As for the Transition Town movement, I think that in effect they're making promises they can't possibly fulfill -- insisting that we can build the future according to some plan that appeals to a contemporary consensus of middle class people in the industrial world, it seems to me, is begging the question, and indeed, begging for trouble -- and the blowback from that is going to be terrifying; in the meantime, though, it's not impossible that the movement can accomplish some worthwhile things. <br><br>Joanhello, most interesting! While numbers aren't the only factor -- I've seen communities turn into a complete mess of freeloading with far fewer than 150 people -- that's a valid point. <br><br>Girl, I think a horseflop is worth a thousand words just now -- you can compost the former, after all. Your metaphor of party clothes and ducks is a great one, by the way. <br><br>Cherokee, my misunderstanding! <br><br>Tim, thank you. Of course you're right that there are important inner dimensions to the mess we're in; the mass flight into fantasy that broke out around 1980 and wasted the thirty years that might have made a smooth transition possible was in large part driven by the kind of murky motives and personal dysfunctions you've mentioned. Still, each audience needs to be addressed in a different way. <br><br>As for water-powered cars, though, I hate to disappoint you, but they're a Brooklyn Bridge scam that keeps surfacing every few years. They work exactly as well as perpetual motion machines, and for much the same reasons -- a good chemist can walk you through the reasons why you can't "burn" water and get any useful energy out of the process.<br><br>Tom, you're quite right that H. sapiens has much the same kinds of herd instincts you'll find in most other social mammals. All in all, they're very useful to us, but they do have their disadvantages. The tendency for organizations to function as organisms, and put their own survival and growth ahead of their ostensible purposes, is one of those. The "international youth movement" is worth watching; I'd keep an eye out for other signs of centralization. <br><br>Kevin, the problems with apartment complexes I mentioned are social, not technical -- in energy terms, living in apartments is much more efficient, and if we hadn't just blown the market for new housing for a couple of decades, it might be worth considering how energy-efficient multifamily housing might be able to help things. <br><br>Richard, fair enough. Dissensus, as I've said before, certainly applies to my ideas as much as anyone's; a case could probably be made that the intentional communities of the last century and a half in the US (they've been around that long, as I'm sure you know) have been a Darwinian environment from which viable forms could be expected to emerge sooner or later. If that's happened, that's good to hear.<br><br><a href=#c4513262650913527802 title="comment permalink">6/26/10, 3:54 PM</a><br><br>

I read twice through the past three posts in June. I let a week pass between readings in order to incubate about what you wrote. <br><br>I have spent many years in rural developing countries where folks were pretty much occupied with the essentials of their survival with no real surplus for excessive consumption. Collectively these folks usually displayed quite a lot of happiness, personal well being, generosity, and because they didn't have any excess wealth to project toward trying to save for retirement or holidays or healthcare insurance etc. they were mostly living in the moment. Of course they suffered in the moment as well. But the suffering wasn't the anxiety of losing what they built up because they didn't have more than their homes and their subsistence work. They suffered real concrete physical sufferings and many certainly died early due to lack of resources for health care. <br><br>So when I look at resource depletion and the great pull back of wealth that will strike our industrial civilization with the progress of peak oil I see a lot of the non essential consumption falling off but I imagine there will still be a lot of energy remaining for quite a long while for the essentials like food, transportation, sanitation, basic health care etc. I don't have any concrete data to back this up but I would guess that of all our energy consumption a great majority of it goes toward non essential consumption and that only a small percentage is really dedicated toward the essentials for survival. <br><br>It seems to me that for this reason the adjustment coming up is really going to impact us far more psychologically and culturally than actual threaten most peoples survival. <br><br>Along with all the desperate attempts with revitalization movements and people trying to bring back what they thought were the good times wont we also see the emergence of also a growing sense of well being and contentment as all the loss of chasing the consumption dream forces folks back to some of the simpler pleasures that is associated with taking care of your most essential needs?<br><br>Could a real mass movement toward a sane transition toward a new cultural paradigm not come out of the rediscovered pleasures of the simpler life that awaits us?

It was April of his first spring, and we were already having our first 90 degree days. He commented that it just could not possibly be true that it was 90 degrees and humid without a break for months on end, people simply could not live in such a climate. Fast forward to August of that same year; he came to visit again, by then in full-on steam bath with dew points in the upper 70s to go with the temperatures in the mid 90s. After a hot day out in the field I asked him if he still thought it was impossible to live in such a climate. He responded "Did I say that? Well, yeah, whatever. I guess it was a pretty hot day, wasn't it?" <br><br>Hang in there, you'll adjust. It could be worse; one of the many community things I do is a series of roadside bird surveys for the FWS, run on the same routes all over the continent every year since 1966. Anyway, they begin 30 minutes before sunrise, and one datum you collect is the air temperature at the start time. A couple of weeks ago on the one I do near Reelfoot Lake in west Tennessee in the Mississippi delta, I recorded a pre-dawn start temperature of 81 F. Be thankful that's not something you're likely to come across up there in Cumberland! <br><br>A bit more to the point, I think Southerners have almost entirely forgotten the basic techniques and routines that used to be universal and learned in childhood for coping with the hot damp without air conditioning, dehumidifiers, or even electric fans. How many houses are built now with screened sleeping porches? Or front-to-back breezeways oriented with the prevailing wind? Or detached kitchens?

My gig is bicycles (I built houses for 25 years, too) so I live outside. I keep hydrated, stay in the shade when possible, even when riding (we fortunately have a network of historic "canopy roads") and use fans. Mid-day naps help, too. <br><br>Bill P. - vernacular architecture is making something of a comeback down here in NoFla - "cracker" houses (lite) are catching on with the "Southern Living" crowd. <br><br>Our shack, built in '82 has high ceilings &amp; ceiling fans, cross ventilation, porches for sleeping &amp; entertaining (we're members of Professional Porch Sitters Union;-). I still need to build an outside kitchen &amp; dogtrot (already drew the plans) but do much cooking outside on the deck. (A confession: the wife curates a museum collection that includes a semi-working 1890s farmstead - we couldn't help but notice how it was done BEFORE AC.)<br><br>We didn't cut down trees so we live in their cooler mini-climate. We also minimized west windows, keep them shaded during hot afternoons, etc. <br><br>You learn to get along.<br><br>As for group leadership, there is an informal social/political network around here who keep in touch indirectly and/or socially. We often "herd" groups in a saner direction and occasionally defeat the most egregious compromisers with smarter analysis;-) <br><br>Haven't yet got much traction with "prosperity without growth [radical contraction]" eh;-) 5% or less of current resource use frightens the Bejesus outta the "green sustainability" Chamber of Commerce crowd. <br><br>We're blessed with a substantial minority of city &amp; county commissioners who pretty much "get it," although they'd (we'd)do much better if we reverted to much more overt organizing (as in the mid-to-late '80s) when we had majorities on those commissions.<br><br>It may be inconsequential, but groups like Transition Town aren't (what I consider) "movements" but just one group among many, one iteration of the "environmental &amp; cultural resource depletion response movement." We all need to find a group (like this one, or others) which suit our style and ideology, and get it on...<br><br>Pace yourself (ourselves;-) though, its a LONG haul...<br><br>Best regards,<br>edde<br><br><a href=#c53846699238043871 title="comment permalink">6/28/10, 4:32 AM</a><br><br>

On NPR this morning was a story about the problems of unreliable electricity in the face of summer heat in the cities of southern Iraq.

This reminds me of Adorno's conclusion to "Cultural Criticism and Society", in which he relates the problem not only of mass movements, but of thinking itself in the sorts of societies we have created:<br>"The more total society becomes, the greater the reification of the mind and the more paradoxical its effort to escape reification on its own. Even the most extreme consciousness of doom threatens to degenerate into idle chatter. Cultural criticism finds itself faced with the final stage of the<br>dialectic of culture and barbarism. To write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric. And this corrodes even the knowledge of why it has become impossible to write poetry today. Absolute reification, which presupposed<br>intellectual progress as one of its elements, is now preparing to absorb the mind entirely. Critical<br>intelligence cannot be equal to this challenge as long as it confines itself to self-satisfied contemplation.<br><br><a href=#c4006372777522051736 title="comment permalink">6/28/10, 12:06 PM</a><br><br>

I live in a climate myself without air conditioning where most everyone else has it.<br><br>However, he then pointed out what Bill just pointed out, that so many structures are built with air conditioning in mind and would be practically unlivable without it, but people with nowhere else to go might still have to live in them, and that's where the problems will start. <br><br>Later I thought of several other factors, the urban heat island is one, cities can be significantly warmer than their surroundings because of all that pavement absorbing the sun, and the cities in the south are far bigger than before air conditioning. The other is simply people themselves. Heat related deaths tend to occur in people with health issues already, and since there's so many people around who are in weakened states, only kept alive by the medical system and could not physically adapt to the heat. Global warming will likely be an increasing factor in the future but even if it isn't, the other factors would be enough to have quite an impact.<br><br>I don't expect a lack of air conditioning to cause a mass dieoff, but I do think many structures will be uninhabitable in the summer in hot climates, and heat related deaths will likely increase to much greater proportions than before air conditioning, at least for a period of time.<br><br><a href=#c6645326428428357602 title="comment permalink">6/28/10, 12:34 PM</a><br><br>

It's a very wise planet, and that's why it knows better than to do what we think we want it to do.<br><br>Edde, I certainly agree that it's a good idea to get together with other people in congenial groups -- that's called "community," last I checked. The question is what kind of group you're going to pick; my preferences tend toward old-fashioned fraternal and charitable groups -- the Masons, the Grange, and so on -- and groups that are in harmony with the oddball religious tradition I follow, such as the Theosophists; still, to each their own. <br><br>Jim, a shave and a haircut? Bah. <br><br>PTDR, good. Mind you, poetry is anything but impossible after (fill in your iconic atrocity of choice here); the sack of Troy was pretty ghastly, too, and it made great poetry. Other than that, though, Adorno made some excellent points. <br><br>Richard, I think some people will die, if only because they don't have any way of dealing with heat than turning up the AC; not that many years ago, remember, Europe had a heat wave that killed 30,000 or so. More generally, there are a lot of preventable ways to die that won't be prevented because most people these days have no clue what to do without a sheltering technostructure to take care of them.

I use my ponytail like, well, a pony's tail, to shoe the bugs off my (almost always bare in summer) back. Of course they do need extra checking for ticks a couple of times a day... <br><br>Our house is an 1886 dogtrot, built in the floorplan of the "3-pen" log cabin (two cabins w/ dogtrot under one roof, third pen behind one of them to serve as kitchen. It's a wood-frame house (balloon framed), though, not log, and the kitchen is not detached (though it is easy to thermally isolate from the rest of the house). The dogtrot is enclosed, of course, but with double doors on both ends. A house of this style is actually pretty easy to retrofit with insulation, as everything can be pried off and then nailed back in place with little impact on the structure. <br><br>JMG -- a novel idea for you, I bet, having to caulk and weather strip to keep heat OUT, not just in! Those nice heavy winter curtains work really well in summer, too, especially if they are lined so that the outward facing side is white. <br><br>As for people dying of heat stroke in modern houses... before that happens I expect you will find folks making many improvised modifications, slapping together screened porches and attatching them wherever they can be fit, busting extra window holes, trying to find some way to make it work. When we get far enough down-peak that electricity is no longer reliable in the suburbs, selling your house and moving in to or building a better one won't be an option any more for most, so people will figure it out somehow. Urban apartment life is another matter, although people lived in that situation before air conditioning as well. One sees lots of images of people sitting in windows and on fire escapes.<br><br><a href=#c6060254561605362936 title="comment permalink">6/28/10, 3:21 PM</a><br><br>

We had no A/C till I was 16! We survived pretty well with window or attic fans and screened porches. Better still were the old homes of my Mom's family in Florida and Georgia that were built for the heat and humidity. <br>An easy way to cool those modern, foolishly designed homes, is to cut and screen small foot long by 6" to 8" high openings near the floor for the incoming breezes. Cut exit holes at the opposite end of the house at ceiling height. Natural convection will pull cooler air at ground level through, up and out of the house at ceiling level. Just plug them with insulated closures for winter. Good insulation and trees planted to shade the house in summer will finish the job.

Before moving back to my home in the Delta, I spent about 10 years helping to start the oldest cohousing community in the US. I had many wonderful times with people I will love forever, but in the end it wasn't home to me. There are many reasons for that, but there's one thing I have seen and wonder if it's universal. Is there something in the nature of the types of people who believe you can build a consciously planned community that makes them, to use blunt language, inherently unreliable? (Yes, I include myself in this.) I've seen 3 "ground up" cohousing communities get started in N Cal and I don't think any of them had a majority of the founding members still present by the time the first dirt was moved. The retrofit community I was a part of also had a very high turnover. Mostly I think because the sort of educated, affluent, progressive-minded person interested in these sorts of things tend to be highly mobile. There's always a job offer somewhere else to consider, or, gee, I always wanted to spend time in Hawaii, etc.<br><br>I guess I'm just saying I don't know if I'd put a lot of trust in a group of people who mostly arrived from somewhere else and now want to "build" a community. Most places other than suburbs that sprang into existence in the last half century already have a community, or several communities. Those communities might be suffering from a lack of resources, or might have lost their local sense of a relation to the land. They might very well need a shot of conscious input and some information on getting through the coming times, but they don't need to be "built."<br><br>I've been helping a local Farmer's Market, now in its third year, both as an organizer and as a grower. It's been very fulfilling, but one thing I noticed was my tendency to jump in and try to focus and organize the meetings we have ("facilitate" for those who know the jargon). I almost want to kick myself when I get started on that, but it has helped us move through some meetings with some degree of effectiveness. There's nothing like the incantation, "Let's form a subcommittee on that," or, "Should we put that on the agenda," to keep things from bogging down in a meeting.<br><br>I guess I'm saying that there is a lot of good information and even some useful organizing skills out there that a lot of people have spent a lot of time and energy developing. They might even be of some use to a local community as it approaches some of the difficulties ahead, despite the shortcomings that have been pointed out here. I would love to hear other's ideas on this.<br><br>Apologies for the long post.
