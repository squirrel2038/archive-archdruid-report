As I write these words, the catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico continues unchecked. It seems almost obscene to suggest that anything positive might come out of an oil spill that is already the largest in US history, and of course it’s true that whatever good might be salvaged from the situation will offer little consolation to the ravaged ecosystems and destroyed communities of the Gulf. Still, as teacher and <i>Foxfire</i> founder Eliot Wigginton noted, learning is only made possible by failure, and a failure this gargantuan and many-sided can at least offer us some pointed lessons for the future.<br><br>Most of those, to be sure, should have been obvious a long time ago. The fantasy of technological potency that leads the great majority of Americans, and slightly smaller majorities elsewhere in the industrial world, to think that any imaginable difficulty must have a promptly available technical solution, has been wearing thin for some time. Still, the spectacle of one of the world’s largest oil companies trying to shove chunks of used automobile tire down an undersea gusher in a failed attempt to stanch the flow has enough of a comic opera quality to lead to hard questions about just how well prepared we are to handle the downside of our own technologies once those have been pushed to the wall by the hard limits of geology and physics.<br><br>It will take time for those questions to be asked by more than a very small minority, and even longer for the answers to find their way into the collective conversation of our time. Right now, a great many people seem to be stuck in the same kind of unreason that led travelers stranded by the Eyjafjallajokull eruptions earlier this spring to pound their fists on airline employees’ desks and demand that somebody do something to get the ash out of the air. Equally useless demands that BP, or the US government, or somebody, get out there and stop the oil spill right away, have filled the media of late. It seems very hard for many people to grasp that all the possible ways to stop the spill right away have been tried and have failed, and that the one real hope left – the hard work of drilling a relief well next to the one that’s spewing oil into the Gulf, so that cement can be injected far enough down the borehole to matter – can’t be completed before August at the earliest, and could possibly take until the end of the year.<br><br>The gap between that bitter reality and the fantasy of instant techno-fulfillment that plays so large a role in the modern mind has been filled, on most peak oil websites, with a flurry of comments proposing a dizzying assortment of impractical gimmicks to deal with the crisis. Perhaps the saddest of these is the insistence, repeated even by people who ought to know better, that the US ought to use a nuclear weapon against the well.<br><br>This particular bit of uninspired lunacy takes various forms. Some suggest setting off a warhead at the wellhead; somehow they’ve managed not to notice the impact of the resulting tsunami on all the oil platforms and pipelines in the Gulf, just for starters. Others insist that a warhead ought to be lowered down the well bore; of course this fails to deal with the fact that the bore is jammed with wrecked drilling hardware, not to mention full of hot, sand-laden crude oil blasting up from the depths at a pressure of 13,000 pounds per square inch, not much less than that used in industrial machinery to make water cut holes in solid metal. Still others propose drilling a hole down next to the existing well and putting the warhead down that; here again, by the time a hole wide enough to admit even a small tactical warhead could be drilled to that level, the relief wells now under way will be long finished.<br><br>The notion that a nuclear weapon is the answer to BP’s undersea gusher is conclusive evidence, if any more were needed, that reasonable thought has gone right out the window. Admittedly it’s only fair to say that this happened with nuclear weapons a long time ago. To a frightening extent, the US nuclear arsenal has become a phallic talisman of national omnipotence that serves mostly to help Americans distract themselves from the waning of the real foundations of their country’s former hegemony. If that arsenal ever ceases to be militarily useful – and it’s probably a safe bet that China, to name only one likely candidate, has scores of laboratories working right now on technologies to make that happen, paid by the billions a year we spend to import salad shooters and cheap electronics – our national nervous breakdown may be one for the record books.<br><br>Still, there’s a sense in which it’s unfair to critique the proponents of nuking BP’s oil well merely because their plan won’t work and could very easily make an already catastrophic situation even worse. These are difficulties in putting the plan into practice, and it’s not supposed to be put into practice. It serves, rather, as an incantation, a way to banish the appalling awareness that neither you, nor I, nor anyone else except the fairly small number people actually struggling to deal with the well, can do anything about it.<br><br>Incantations of this sort make up a remarkably large fraction of the talk about peak oil and the future of industrial society these days. Get into an online conversation on the subject, for example, and you can be all but certain that at least one of the people involved will pipe up with a plan to solve it. It doesn’t matter at all that, much more than nine times out of ten, the person proposing the plan is doing nothing to make it happen, and neither is anybody else. The plan is not meant to happen. It’s meant to dispell the profoundly troubling sense that the future is spinning out of control and there’s not actually all that much that we can do about it.<br><br>Grand plans of this kind are hardly the only sort of incantation being chanted at the moment. A claim splashed across the cornucopian end of the internet in recent weeks insists that the world has enough readily available crude oil to keep going at the present rate of production for 800 years. To describe this as the end product of a horse’s digestive tract is to insult honest manure; not one scrap of evidence backs such a claim, but then evidence is beside the point when you’re composing an incantation.<br><br>The logic that underlies this kind of incantatory communication is often called “magical thinking” nowadays. There’s a deep irony in this phrase, since this kind of thinking is exactly what mages – actual practitioners of magic – don’t do. I’ve generally avoided talking about magic in these essays, but this is a context where that can’t be avoided. I’d like to ask those of my readers who have religious or rationalist objections to magic to keep reading; they may be surprised by some of what follows.<br><br>Probably the best place to start that discussion is with an elegant volume that’s sitting on the desk next to my keyboard as I type these words. Scarlet Imprint, a small British magical publisher, has just released <a href=http://www.scarletimprint.com/xvi.htm>an anthology about the crisis of our time</a> titled XVI; students of magical symbolism will recognize this gnomic label as a reference to the sixteenth arcanum of the Tarot, which shows a tower being blown to smithereens. I have an essay in it; so do sixteen other contemporary mages; I’d be indulging in absurdity if I claimed to agree with more than a part of what’s in the book, but one thing not to be found in its pages is the sort of “magical thinking” just mentioned.<br><br>There’s a reason for this. One of the most distinguished 20th century theoreticians and practitioners of magic, Dion Fortune, defined magic as “the art and science of causing change in consciousness in accordance with will.” (If that doesn’t sound like a recipe for making broomsticks fly, you’re beginning to catch on.) The basic tools of the mage are will and imagination; the raw materials he or she works with are symbolism and ritual – “poetry in the realm of acts,” as Fortune’s near-contemporary Ross Nichols defined that last term. The point of magic, as Fortune’s definition suggests, is changing states and contents of consciousness; it can have effects on the material world as well, but that normally involves influencing beings that bridge the gap between mind and matter – you and me, for example.<br><br>Exactly what can and can’t be done by way of will and imagination, working through emotionally powerful symbols and ritual psychodrama, is a question on which not all mages agree. Still, I don’t know of anyone in the field who claims to be able to levitate a broom, say, or to do any of the other things that make up the stock in trade of fantasy magicians. If magic instead of science had come out on top in the reality wars of the late Renaissance, we might all be watching movies in which mysterious scientists in white lab coats mutter algebraic formulae, climb astride giant test tubes, and zoom off to the Moon; compare that to real science, and you’ve got some sense of the gap between <i>Harry Potter</i> and real magic.<br><br>This is why serious mages generally roll their eyes when somebody comes along and insists that we ought to be able to solve physical problems – for example, shortages of material substances – with what amounts to magic. This happens quite often; I can usually count on hearing from somebody every month or so who thinks that because I’ve written several books on magic, and serve as the presiding officer of a contemporary Druid order, I ought to agree with them that we can conjure some replacement for petroleum out of thin air, or in some other way produce a world much more comfortable than the one we’ve got, by some change in consciousness or other.<br><br>They tend to be rather discomfited when I explain to them, as gently as possible, that they’ve made a very elementary mistake in magical theory. The technical term for it is confounding the planes; “the planes of existence,” an old axiom has it, “are discrete and not continuous” – which means in plain English that mind is mind, matter is matter, and making the transition from mind to matter is not an easy, much less an automatic, thing; it has to be done in specific ways, and with careful attention to the very real limits of the material world.<br><br>Now this does not mean that magic is useless in the face of the predicament of the industrial world. The problem is that the changes in consciousness that would actually do some good are changes that next to nobody in the industrial world is willing to make: for example, a shift in priorities that deliberately embraces poverty, accepting a rich personal, intellectual, and social life as a substitute for, or even an improvement on, the material extravagance that the industrial nations currently offer their more favored inmates. That change in consciousness is certainly accessible to each and every one of us; human beings just like us have been making it for many thousands of years; but it requires a rare willingness to step outside of the approved habits and ideas of modern industrial cultures. Striking a rebellious pose and claiming originality is very fashionable these days; actually rejecting the conventional wisdom of our time, and thinking thoughts that conflict with those of one’s contemporaries, is less common now than it was in the supposedly conformist Fifties.<br><br>I’ve come to suspect that one of the principal reasons for that, and more generally for the remarkable way in which today’s industrial societies are continuing to sleepwalk toward the abyss, is precisely the habit of incantation discussed earlier in this post. The internet is the natural home of incantation; discussions on email lists and online forums, bereft of the subtleties of normal human communication, often turn into a duel of incantations that the loudest and most intransigent voice generally wins.<br><br>Now it’s worth noting that incantation is a tool, and like any other tool, it can be used or misused. There are plenty of contexts in which the skillful use of incantations can have beneficial effects. Assure yourself repeatedly that you can accomplish some task that is in fact within your powers, for example, and your odds of accomplishing it go up significantly; assure yourself repeatedly that it’s out of your reach, and your chances of failure do the same. Still, using incantations as a nonchemical tranquilizer to ward off stress, and to assure yourself that everything is fine when everything is <i>not</i> fine, is much more problematic. In a time of crisis when keeping a level head and going on with life is crucial, it can have a valid place, but if it’s being used to drown out the still small voice that warns of approaching danger, it’s an invitation to disaster. In next week’s post, however, I propose to offer a counterspell.

I am looking past the whole magic thing and am hearing your message. "Magical thinking" is a good description of what so many people seem to be doing. <br><br>I am looking forward to hearing about your "counterspell" as it is much needed. <br><br>I am sceptical about the chance of success of such a spell though, as my experience has been that the reason for the magical thinking in the first place is deep ignorance. I.e. you can't talk about Euler's equations with someone who still counts on their fingers; you have to educate them step by step, building on stuff that they do know, until they are educated enough to be able to grasp the fundamentals of the real topic<br><br>For me the "counterspell" (for the few people I bother to try with) has been slow, relentless education about the fundamental issues (such as the mathematics of geometric growth, and energy concentration). But it is a very slow process.<br><br>If there is any way to speed up the process, then I am interested to hear it (or is that just more magical thinking?).<br><br><a href=magical-thinking.html#c6417777440256365775 title="comment permalink">6/2/10, 11:20 PM</a><br><br>

The company went into the Gulf, intent on drilling and making as much profit as possible. No thought of who the oil would go to---heating homes or providing fuel to keep the lights on, etc, just pure greed for profit. My friend commented that maybe the planet had just had enough and burst out of it's skin, in effect, a scream of "You want oil, you bastards?

I ask because of the double entendre of the title of this post.<br><br> Using the word 'magic' in a sincere sense is going to alienate a large group of people, effectively shutting down large chunks of the reader's mind. Because, for most people 'magic' means broom sticks and crystal balls. And since language is defined by the majority using the word 'magic' in a sincere sense makes you a quack. <br><br> But, on the other hand, the purpose of language is communication. Communicating that the world is laboring under the fantasy of thinking that technology will magically solve all problems on demand and contrasting that notion with the reality that propaganda/social norms/neuro-linguistic programming/etc. can effect a meaningful change in aggregate and individual behavior is artfully encompassed in the phrase 'magical thinking.'<br><br><a href=magical-thinking.html#c2045800011442613085 title="comment permalink">6/3/10, 12:33 AM</a><br><br>

As a scientific programmer, I worked with several, including a few that were programming managers. It seemed that programmers most often aspired to elegant programming, or at least finishing the assignment. EE's all seemed to be working on their five-year plan to advance to supervisor / manager / executive.<br><br>I look at my small town, and the guys running the lumber yard are working hard to . . . keep lumber and nails available. The folks at the grocery store for the last ten years (since I moved here) seem to have work and to some extent, happiness.<br><br>The movie theater where I work part time is interested in advancement. If you have been there a couple of years and advanced to shift leader, or assistant manager, you get lots of attention and recognition from the manager, district manager, and home office; the rest are part of the replaceable pool of peasants. Just as they focus on the magic of a particular "successful" movie to drag customers in instead of working diligently and continuously to nurture existing customers, management tends to grow management instead of stability. In their defense, this is a nice place to work, even if at times the facilities seem under-maintained and products seem a bit low-cost. But, hey, the theatre has always been an expression of illusion!<br><br>It just seems that the materialism flows from ambition, ambition for status, ambition for social and cultural "advancement" (in the absence of spiritual development).<br><br><a href=magical-thinking.html#c497328127491006194 title="comment permalink">6/3/10, 6:16 AM</a><br><br>

I don't know, however, the extent to which a strict rationalist must assume that the material and mental planes are completely independent of one another. (Even in the Renaissance, it had to be obvious that affecting the matter of our brain will affect our mind too, and everyone will make the transition back to mere matter eventually, sadly automatic.) It continues to surprise me that people have taken rationalism and empiricism to such extremes as to imagine them exclusive of one another, but that probably reflects my second-hand understanding of the arguments people have actually made. <br><br>I like reading about the early thinkers of the Renaissance--I'm impressed with the creative strides they made using a more diverse philosophical foundation than many people today. The later period may have been engaged in "reality wars" although I'm enough of an empiricist in the end to view it as a gradual evolution of the parts that were actually working at explaining things.<br><br>Anyway, regardless of what consciousness is or can do, I can't disagree that substantive changes in it are going to be necessary before too long. And speaking of the Renaissance, it's always interesting to compare our own times to when big shifts in the popular viewpoint did actually happen.<br><br><a href=magical-thinking.html#c2617393069552007574 title="comment permalink">6/3/10, 7:11 AM</a><br><br>

I wish that wasn't the case, but there it is. <br><br>Onion, bingo. Too much Hollywood on the brain, not enough exposure to real life problems that can't be solved in an hour and a half. <br><br>Lamb, intent has a potent influence on result, so long as you combine the intent with action -- cooking the meal, for example. Certainly BP's intent seems to have been a major factor setting them up for disaster. <br><br>Tim, my audience covers a pretty broad spectrum. Those who get the point of the phrase will get it; those who don't may learn something else from it. <br><br>Rainman, granted! Doubtless "wake up and smell the benzene" could be turned into bad Latin. <br><br>Wordek, that's a great story.

More on this later.<br><br>Sofistek, see my comment to Tim above. <br><br>Ponter and Deepian, it's a complex issue. The sort of attitude Sofistek displayed in the comment right before yours is very common, and education can only proceed one step at a time. <br><br>Ponter (again), we'll see!<br><br>John, I'm not sure if you're aware that people are paid to do that sort of thing. During the last US presidential election, the daughter of a friend of ours worked for the Obama campaign; her job consisted of surfing the internet, finding any post that criticized Obama, and posting canned responses to counter the criticism. She was one of a team of people who did that all day, every day. No doubt the very well funded global warming denial lobby has the equivalent. <br><br>As for global climate change, my take is that it's clearly happening, at least partly because of human pollution, but that it's a good deal less unusual than current rhetoric suggests. The Earth's temperature jumped 15 degrees F. in less than a decade at the end of the last ice age, you know; sudden, devastating climate shifts are business as usual on this planet. <br><br>Bill, bingo. If our health care system wasn't simply a sales force for the pharmaceutical industry, placebo-based medicine would get billions a year in funding -- we're talking about an internal mind-body mechanism that allows sugar pills to cure major illnesses, after all! -- and we'd eventually get as good at it as, say, your average tribal shaman. <br><br>Daughter, I haven't read Wesselman -- I've tended to avoid most of the current neo-shamanic literature, for a variety of reasons. Still, I'll put him on the list. <br><br>Brad, I don't think they're quite the same thing, but abandoning the (by now mostly unreachable) dream of upward mobility is another potent magical act that can have some very positive payoffs. <br><br>Jeff, it's a great book -- my point was simply that very few mages agree on much of anything!<br><br>Patrick, well put.

Thus we got a take on the world that's very good at figuring out what nonliving matter does in artificial situations, along with an ideology that states that the benefits you can get by figuring out what nonliving matter does in artificial situations are more important than, say, social harmony or a sustainable relationship with the biosphere.<br><br><a href=magical-thinking.html#c8323409720877628817 title="comment permalink">6/3/10, 7:34 AM</a><br><br>

It's even less plausible than stuffing a 14000 psi out of control well with salad shooters and tires and sports equipment. I've never been a fan of the South and maybe it is an attempt by damn yankees to finish the job that Sherman started. We heard the same solution proposed in Viet Nam when I was tramping around.

Some would argue this is a rather all-encompassing definition, to the point of being unhelpful. But to me the key phrase here is "through all means." Industrial society focuses on physical and mechanical means. But a huge part of the lives of the individual and the society is not mechanical, it is interpersonal, psychological, and mythological. Self-described magicians focus also on these non-material aspects. I think it would be absurd to claim that the internal state of ones consciousness has no manifestations in the external physical world -- what is language but a means for expressing the inner outwardly and affecting the world around you, for example? <br><br>Think of the magic of poetry, of music, of advertising and marketing, of the mythologies of progress and apocalyticism, and how profoundly they affect the material nature of our contemporary existence.

To me, "magic" is a term that is frequently used to label that which cannot be explained. In that sense, we all engage in "magical thinking". The problem in modern industrial cultures is that technology is something that most people view in magical terms. They don't understand the complexities of it, but they worship the benefits they derive from it. The shift underlying modern magical thinking is a shift away from reverence and awe of that which is natural and organic, and towards that which is artificial. In the process, we have come to worship ourselves, instead of the earth.

The Earth's temperature jumped 15 degrees F. in less than a decade at the end of the last ice age, you know; sudden, devastating climate shifts are business as usual on this planet. <br><br><br>I have my own theory how that happened, it seems there's a series of meteor craters walking into the water and off of the continental shelf, on the East coast. It would have created a nice tidal wave of, biblical proportions around the Atlantic basin. At approximately the same time there were landslips under water in a Norwegian fjord that exposed two large methane deposits to the sea. <br><br>I did hear a few phrases in radio introductions this morning that really ought to clue people in on how tight resources are getting today. Things like 'wood shortages,' or something like '60% of our oil from off shore deposits coming through Louisiana.' It's too bad it won't get them to thinking, I'm sure they won't even consciously notice those phrases and consider the implications for their lives.<br><br>When it comes to magic, it comes to me with sensual, poetic descriptions about the natural world around me. I do see it as alive, with a beauty that can never be described the same way twice.

No matter...<br><br>What is matter? Never mind...<br><br>If you've ever had an argument with a true believer in a particular religion or political philosophy, you'll know that changing someone's belief system is one of the most difficult things you can try to do.<br><br>So, is this just the way our brains are wired? Evolution doesn't seem to have a particular destination; it just works with whatever is available. While there are probably perfectly valid reasons why we think the way we do, we are still faced with the reality that emotions often overcome logic, and the lust for power or wealth often make us do things that lead to the kind of mess we are in today.<br><br>After living among the natives of this planet for over 6 decades, I have come to the following conclusion:<br><br><b>Just because someone has a sincere and deeply held belief in something does not necessarily mean that what he believes in is true.</b><br><br>This holds for bible-thumping fundamentalists who deny evolution, college professors who still believe in communism, global warming deniers, global warming believers, Ayn Rand libertarians, the Taliban, and just about anyone else you can think of (just read most of what is posted on the Internet if you don't believe me).<br><br>Sometimes reality will whomp you upside the head and you'll realize that some of the things you thought were true, just aren't. The current oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico could very well provide just such a whomp. Whether it will be sufficient to change enough minds remains to be seen.<br><br>If enough of us have the epiphany about the necessity to change the way we all live, then maybe we can get through the next couple decades with minimum bloodshed and suffering. <br><br>Unfortunately, many people will react to the coming changes by ignoring any inconvenient truths that don't match their preconceived notions. Some will go so far as trying to shut up (or, in extreme cases, even kill) anyone who disputes their version of the real truth. The old guys on the reviewing stand in Red Square were pretty good at this. The people who blow themselves up in order to kill infidels in the name of Allah offer another example of this phenomenon.<br><br>Magical thinking is only one of the problems facing us.

They worked with Perkins to better understand the industrial world, and how to stop it from destroying their habitat. Perkins and team explained the concepts of money, profit, production and the like. The elders returned to him after deliberation with their solution. The problem of the industrialized world was that they had the wrong dream (materialism). To solve the problem, they needed to change the dream.<br><br>Giving energy to dreams is like magic; applied variations of consciousness creating changes in the physical world. I find the wisdom of the Shuar deeply meaningful in today’s predicament.

For those unfamilar with it, it's Hank Wesselman's account of his altered state experiences as well as his thoughts on them. In those experiences he claims to have connected with someone named Nainoa living 5000 years in the future.<br><br>Sound crazy yet? I understand if you think so, I'm skeptical too but there are several reasons I think it is his actual experiences. One thing is that he has had his brain tested and it goes into a very unusual state during these experiences, so I can be pretty sure he's not not totally making everything up.<br><br>The other reasons are more subtle and that's what I think is relevant to this blog. The books are generally formatted with one chapter on his visions, then one about his thoughts on what just happened as well as other related subjects usually having to do with shamanism and spirituality. What's peculiar is that, despite his written accounts having had to be filtered through his perceptions, I still notice many instances where his perceptions don't quite seem to match his actual experience. Although he's a scientist to start, he ends up buying pretty much conforming to "new ageism" and apocalypticism in his own interpretations, while to me especially after reading JMG, many aspects of Nainoa's world could have come about very differently then he thinks. To me this disconnect actually is an indication that his experiences did not come from his own mind, as if that were the case he probably would have dreamed a world more to his expectations.<br><br>For some background, Nainoa's world is California in the future, which is then a tropical climate, and Nainoa is actually Hawaiian (although he has blue eyes so the Hawaiians then are geneticaly descended from the diversity of people there now), in this future the Hawaiians colonized California which was empty of people when they arrived. They do have old vague accounts that describe the collapse of our civilization as sudden, which leads Wesselman to apocalypticism, but as JMG has pointed out, events that actually takes place over long periods to someone living then are later thought of as sudden events, and also the collapse I think would be more likely to be rapid in Hawaii than elsewhere because of it's so far from anywhere and still dependent on so much imports. The collapse would have to end up worse in the end than JMGs scenarios, for the West Coast to become totally depopulated for example, but it could still take place along similar lines.<br><br>Also, Nainoa's world is no utopia, Wesselman does paint it in a good light in some ways, although he's dismayed at the loss of mush or our knowledge, but there's still conflict (at the beginning of Spiritwalker Nainoa has to flee sttackers to his settlement), and it's not what your average new-ager thinks of as his dream world.<br><br>There's a lot more I could say about this subject but don't want to take up too much comment space, but I'll conclude that even Wesselman states that he doesn't think the future is set in stone, that he's seen one possibility. Who knows, maybe it's a "parallel universe". And I'm still a skeptic too, but I do think it's a book worth reading for yourself, even if you end up thinking it's total hogwash.<br><br><a href=magical-thinking.html#c1155485722773050238 title="comment permalink">6/3/10, 8:14 PM</a><br><br>

Serious magical practice is very close in its basic structure and approach to serious Vajrayana Buddhist practice, or to some of the more structured Christian mystical disciplines. The language as well as the forms differ, and so do some of the applications, but there's a lot of common ground. <br><br>Koho, yes, I read the same article about Nigeria, and don't find it hard to believe at all. One of the secrets of catabolic collapse is that we've been exporting collapse to the Third World as a way to avoid facing it here at home. <br><br>Andy, if anything, it'll be that ability that saves as many of us as can or will be saved. <br><br>Bill, one of the reasons that I prefer Fortune's definition is that it provides focus. Of course it's possible to define magic so broadly that every intentional act is magical -- but at that point you've lost sight of the fact that there's a very specific set of techniques and philosophy, historically known as magic, that allows you to do some remarkable things with consciousness and intention. <br><br>Keifus, read it, and then read it again. Most people don't catch the huge implications of Kuhn's work on the first reading. <br><br>Garage, it's not the ones who hold onto the Cross that worry me, it's the ones that see the human ego and its toys as the be-all and end-all of existence. <br><br>Ariel, you're most welcome. <br><br>Pgrass, science is a source of prestige in modern society, so people treat it as they do any other form of prestige. The sad thing about that is that much of the potential of science as a way of knowing gets lost in the shuffle. <br><br>Colonel, you're certainly right that worshipping ourselves and ignoring our dependence on nature is a recipe for disaster! By magical thinking, though, I mean two different things; first, the common meaning of the phrase, which is believing that wanting something will make it happen; second, the kind of thinking that mages actually do, which is a good deal subtler -- and, I suggest, saner. <br><br>Steven, there's very little specifically on magical theory in print; in most worthwhile books on magic, you get bits of the theory mixed in with lots of practical training, and a great deal of the theory is expressed in symbolic terms and has to be "unpacked" in study and meditation. (Dion Fortune's major work on magical theory, <i>The Cosmic Doctrine</i>, is written entirely in the form of a symbolic cosmogony and doesn't appear to be about theory at all.) You might try my book <a href="http://redwheelweiser.com/detail.html?id=9781578633180" rel=nofollow>Learning Ritual Magic</a> for a theory-dense primer, or <a href="http://redwheelweiser.com/detail.html?id=9781578633975" rel=nofollow>The Druid Magic Handbook</a> for a similar text written specifically for Druids. <br><br>Rodney, see my comment to Garage above. <br><br>Professor, it's definitely another topic and probably another blog. I don't see abstract ideal justice as something that can be achieved in a human social setting, but there's a long conversation in explaining why that is.<br><br><a href=magical-thinking.html#c873113310479013262 title="comment permalink">6/3/10, 8:28 PM</a><br><br>

This is not a stable planet!<br><br>Nebris, tell me that when you've driven a Trabant. <br><br>Robin, a "personality disorder" that can cure organic diseases -- and the placebo effect has been repeatedly shown to do this -- is hardly something to dismiss in such terms!<br><br>Moose, excellent. You get tonight's gold star for recognizing that evolution isn't progress, and doesn't have a goal or a destination. You'd be amazed -- or maybe you wouldn't be -- how many people miss that. <br><br>Rbtp, the Shuar are right, of course. I suspect they haven't realized, though, that anyone could be so unsophisticated as to forget that their dream is a dream, and mistake it for reality. No tribal hunter gatherer would be that dense; it takes an advanced civilization to produce people so naive about the inside of their own heads. <br><br>Tristan, therapy's done by one person, the therapist, for another, the patient, for the purpose of helping the patient fit into a dysfunctional society. Magic is done by the mage, for the mage, for the purpose of transcending the dysfunctions of society. That's the short form, but it's pretty close. <br><br>Phil, that's a good point. Thanks for the links!<br><br>Llewellyn, I'm an agnostic when it comes to any apparent violation of natural law that I haven't actually witnessed. I don't fall into the logical fallacy of "extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof" -- it amazes me that people who claim to respect reason would use such an obvious bit of special pleading; I simply want to see it myself. <br><br>Scruff, I have Aspergers, and I've never had any trouble at all using standard magical techniques. Neither have other Aspies I know -- in fact, the Aspergers tendency toward mental hyperfocus and tolerance of solitude seem to give Aspies, on average, an easier time becoming capable mages than neurotypical people have. <br><br>Arabella, welcome back! I find that deliberately embracing poverty is a very effective way to make my own life simpler and more comfortable; the less stuff you have, the less stuff you have to worry about. <br><br>Raven, thank you.

That does not mean I don't recognize the powerful and special nature of particularly heightened or opened or relaxed or dissociated or projected or whatever states of consciousness achieved willfully through specific practices, it just all feels more like a continuum to me. Maybe though that is just a product of having been doing this stuff for so many decades that it all feels thoroughly natural now, even the stuff that some might class as "supernatural" (as if there could be anything in the universe that is not natural). Or maybe it's that dissociate tripple conjunction straddling the 1st house cusp in my natal chart...<br><br>Which leads me to two perhaps more directly relevant tangents...<br><br>The thought occurs to me that ceremonial magical practices are generally associated with city-state societies aren't they? As opposed to every-act-is-a-magical-act traditions that seem more connected to agrarian and hunter-gatherer societies. Well, except, I guess traditional shamanic practices in some cultures can be about as high ceremony as anything, and are often embedded within every-act-is-a-spiritual-act worldviews, so never mind on that idea... I do know for myself the desire for structured ritual decreased dramatically when I personally switched to a rural life from an urban one, so I'm probably just projecting. Still, I wonder if more ritualized and overtly willful practices might be particularly helpful, appealing, and effective for minds that are products of urban western societies, especially for introducing the concepts, practices, and experiences to those who become interested but have not previously thought in these terms. <br><br>Finally, about the laws of nature -- I am convinced that real magic never breaks natural laws. It works through them. Sometimes it appears to tweak the probabilities, but unlikely is not unnatural. And even that might be a matter of perception rather than statistically verifiable reality; still, the impacts are no less powerful.<br><br>As an addendum, I just remembered with a chuckle a mystery initiation ritual I once performed for a college group. We went through the ceremony of purification and challenging, I lead them down into the underworld (which some might have thought strongly resembled our crawlspace), and revealed the sacred object to them that embodied the fundamental nature of life, death and rebirth -- the Compost Pile. Dunno how many left enlightened, but you can't force the great truths on the unready!<br><br><a href=magical-thinking.html#c3080965850431755530 title="comment permalink">6/3/10, 10:27 PM</a><br><br>

There are <a href=http://smirkingchimp.com/thread/bob-burnett/28746/what-caused-the-bp-oil-leak-magical-thinking rel=nofollow>enough people</a> thinking <a href=http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/05/the-end-of-magical-oil/56755/ rel=nofollow>like you</a>. What power do we have?<br><br>I do not wish to bring Toffler very often, but his influential <i>shock-futurology</i> was a (somewhat obscured but big) factor in the mass psychology of dismissing nature and technology limits. Say, this week I found at the <i>conservative</i> NRO <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/435185/conservative-rock-songs-deconstructed/john-j-miller?page=2" rel=nofollow>an explanation</a> that the word <i>“Gingrichian”</i> must mean <i>a future-shocky optimism about markets and technology — not a stern-faced call for going back to the Old Ways of Doing Things.</i>.<br><br>The remarkable thing is that Toffler’s books were not particularly hyped, but the underlying philosophy of embracing technological, corporate, governmental and other changes basically dominates the development of global and local societies. It succeeds where many <i>(Commun)isms</i> failed. The package of embracing accelerating novelty, transience was accepted briskly in Eastern Europe and all other <i>freed worlds</i>, in particular. It is accepted as common economic and social wisdom everywhere, without direct opposition. Is shock-futurology not a surrogate <i>magical</i> formula for the masses of this time? <br><br>The accelerating change does have a technological basis, but I conjecture that it is rather deliberatively <i>leveraged</i>. If certain elite powers are confidently steering the world to their liking, the shock-futurology must be their <i>magical</i>-psychological tool. <br><br>The question of how much people can cope and adopt to the hectic change misses a big point. To my understanding, virtually any amount of novelty and change is comfortable if a person is motivated, has immediate successes and particular goals. But if these ingredients are missing, change is hell. And this has social implications - the culture of hectic change is a heavy differentiator between <i>creative innovators</i> and <i>the rest</i>. Besides, even if people can cope with continuous job changes, endless corporate or social <i>reforms</i>, they are distracted enough not to see how much they are loosing. As you know, blue collar wages had been shamelessly decreasing, social traditions and symbols destroyed, environment neglected. With so much blinding change, who will complain of gone Caribbean, deplorable use of military power, massive political shifts, or angry mob violence?<br><br>Perhaps human nature is indeed irresponsible towards the supporting environment, and the civilization would be piloting towards an abyss under any <i>practical</i> utopia. But this well-defined suicidal mass psychology of <i>innovation embracing “capitalism”</i> is particularly unfortunate, whether it is emergent or managed outright. When it comes to (individual or societal) adaptation, change tempo and available time matter a lot. Just as financial markets finally collapse after short periods of madly dubious financial schemes, civilizations probably make their last few steps when they catch a singular virus of endless “inevitable” change.<br><br><a href=magical-thinking.html#c6128725346498001250 title="comment permalink">6/4/10, 5:16 AM</a><br><br>

Guy</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>"...I have Aspergers..." My initial reaction was my usual feeling of rebellion that wells up in me when anyone uses the labels that psychiatrists and the like give. When I was in 3rd/4th grade in foster care I was defined as quite obsessive compulsive and suffering of attention deficit disorder and other things and given rather large pills to take. Grades plummeted. It did little for the symptoms. It wasn't until years later I read that the o.c.d. and a.d.d., like so many other psychological labels, were labels for groups of common symptoms collected together and not associated with exclusive, specific, identifiable causes that could be directly altered in defined ways which would bring about new fruit. I was taken off the pills (at my mother's insistence I believe) and after thorough testing by a lead teacher at the school I was attending while in foster care I was taken from the 'behavior improvement program' (the class with the room with the padded walls and bubble windows that they could lock a child in if they got too violently out of hand) and put into the class of children for advanced learning. I do not equate the ability to regurgitate information with being a better person but it is interesting to me to review the life gone by and observe the change in their interpretation of my compatibility with society as a whole and thus my prescribed labels and chemicals intended to alter my mind until I seemed conveniently compatible with accepted assumptions (so called common sense) and habits. The thought, taking so very much less time to think than to try and encode in words for transmission through media of written communication, passed in a second or two through what I suppose is my mind and I said (to the image of you in my thoughts) "If people are going to go along and employ labels like that then they might as well say they are possessed by or channeling spirits or be suffering from polluted chakra or (pause) or I suppose they really might as well say that they are possessed of Aspergers, suffering from Aspergers, compatible with the label of Aspergers or in whatever way they choose to communicate that collection of commonly associated symptoms." Perhaps you said it, perhaps I read it elsewhere, but I recall now a description of psychologists and the like in modern society that drew an interesting parallel between the positions those individuals seem to occupy in the movements of this society and the positions of priests and other keepers of the dominant faiths of ages gone by. If other druids I might meet along life's way might regularly inspire the (for lack of a better word) images, in my mind, that you do, then I should eagerly undertake the pursuit of their association. I am grateful for your regular communication here; even last night after again reviewing your previous post and its associated interchange of ideas (along with the dozens of other articles read and portions of a book on geomancy, a book on sacred geometry, reading the AODA's First Degree Curriculum, listening to a lecture by Noam Chomsky, and other explorations) I thought of the situation of the oil in the gulf and oil's relationship to our society and a thought rolled by regarding seemingly common symbolism of certain colors "Black is often portrayed as evil, undesirable, simply not good; I recall reading an article that addressed in some detail the possibility that the probable roots of black and white are the same, both simply associated with the absence of color; I remember Wade Davis saying in a talk of ancient cultures and referring to a particular group '...this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend...' and I thought 'the darkness of night is perhaps not in itself evil for being black but the absence of light in that darkness often fails to illuminate.'"

<div class="avtb a_61c74c" id=c8610189322690676995></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/02333438671130100114 rel=nofollow>Bill Pulliam</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>I'd like to delve a bit more into the Aspergers thing; this post dealing as it does with consciousness, will, focus, and symbolism seems like one of the more appropriate occasions to address this. Aspies are a moderately large subset of the population, and have an influence and importance disproportionate to their raw population numbers in many fundamental areas of society, such as art, science, and technology. It seems absurd, really, to characterize this mode of brain operation as a "disorder" when it contributes so profoundly to the Great Human Endeavor. For the record, I am not an Aspy, to the surprise of my friends I test out with an AQ of about 18 which is deep within the neurotypical range. But I think I earned most of those 18 points on the science-geek questions rather than the social behavior questions, which has always lead me into places like Academia and the Internet that often seem like global Asperger's conventions! So I am extremely familiar with the Aspy Way and all its myriad variations. <br><br>One thing I have noted is that many Aspies are particularly drawn to structured ritual, ceremony, and costume. On beyond the engineering labs and blogs, some places I have noted a higher predominance of the Aspy Mind are in religious communities (mainstream and alternative), SCA-RennFaire-LARP-etc. activities, and, interestingly, the Leather-BD-SM-DS-etc. sexual fetish communities. So, I can see that the affection for ritual and the ability to concentrate intently on an object of focus would be great draws to and advantages in ritual magical practices. <br><br>But another common trait of those born to the Aspy Way is less clear to me how it interacts with this stuff: the pervasive tendency towards literalism. One of the common quirks of many of my Aspy friends is that they tend to stub a toe when the path of the conversation takes a sudden turn into analogy or metaphor. This literalism is often fodder for Aspy humor, such as "You bought a hot water heater? Why does your hot water need to be heated?" I really wonder how this Literalism works in systems of myth and magic that are built almost entirely out of symbols and metaphors. Clearly this is not a high barrier, but I wonder if a "typical" Aspy (another non-existent beast) processes these symbols and metaphors in a fundamentally different way that does the "typical" neurotypical (yes, I know, that's a redundancy, another thing the Aspy Mind is often especially sensitive to). It's common for Aspies and NTs as broad groups to handle concepts in fundamentally different ways; I'd expect this is another of those instances, and it would definitely be relevant when conversing about these topics across the Aspy-NT line. <br><br>By the way, JMG, not to overpersonalize this, but in our brief face-to-face time and much more extensive online interactions, I have not actually seen this literalism strongly in you. In your writing you revel in metaphor, symbol, and analogy, you don't trip over them at all. But, as I think about it, it also seems that the infrequent instances in which you and I seriously butt heads on a topic, it is usually within this realm.<br><br><a href=magical-thinking.html#c8610189322690676995 title="comment permalink">6/4/10, 6:31 AM</a><br><br>

John, several people have probably already told you about this book, but "just in case:" there was an author, economist Juliet Schor, on NPR's Diane Rhem Show yesterday morning. She's written a book called "Plenitude: The New Economics of True Wealth" that, from the hour-long discussion, echoes many of the practical points you make in this blog: downscale; get hold of your own time; domestic economy; etc. I haven't yet read it and don't know if she works with the peak oil concept, but I found it interesting (and wonderful) to hear these ideas being discussed in a full hour in a mainstream media outlet. Much spluttering and squawking ensued about the impossibility of her ideas, but to me that shows that they hit a nerve.

As someone about two years into the mages' kind of magical thinking project (performing daily ritual and exercises designed to bring about changes in consciousness) I must say that it's incredibly useful both to seeing the world anew, and seeing through its more typical deceits. <br><br>If some of your readers are thinking about doing the Druidry Handbook or the Ritual Magic book, if may be instructive to have an oustide endorsement: after the first year of honest practice, you'll be more honest, more physically and emotionally flexible, less personally ambitious but more practically goal-oriented, less angry, more balanced, more serene, less nervous, more social, less materialistic, more open and ethical. At least you'll see yourself that way. <br><br>Moreover the techniques are general purpose -- you'll find that they're useful at work and in church and at outdoor barbecues and at the local coffee house or bar (though drinking and smoking seem to lose a lot of their luster).<br><br><a href=magical-thinking.html#c4417772783143069775 title="comment permalink">6/4/10, 11:39 AM</a><br><br>

Essentially I concluded that what we refer to as time is like the markings on a ruler. Not a thing or dimension in and of itself, but merely useful as a measure of something else (that something else being defined for the purpose of this hypothesis, as the shape of the universe) So “time passing” is merely a reference to shape change. <br>The past exists only as echoes or fossils in the shape of now. “Been” and “will be” are just references to marks on our ruler “here and now”. There is no “forth dimension”, no past anywhere for us to travel to and no shortcuts to the future. Billy Pilgrim was just dreaming after all.<br>Poo-tee-weet?<br><br>Now before you say anything I know this hypothesis is only relevant to the material plane ;) <br><br>“As for global climate change, my take is that it's clearly happening, at least partly because of human pollution, but that it's a good deal less unusual than current rhetoric suggests”<br>john<br>“I used to be convinced of MMCC and have gained a healthy scepticism”<br><br>Agreed: I first became aware of the theory of anthropogenic climate change about the same time as peak oil. Late 70's early 80's. Researched what was current about both topics at the time and came to the conclusion that oil should be conserved during an ongoing process of developing and implementing other energy sources, and that a long term investment ( ballpark 80 years) in climate modelling would possibly begin to produce the core components of one of humanity's greatest triumphs in our understanding of this complex and mysterious physical world.<br>And what did we get less than 30 yrs later? Cow farts make world too hot! Run em over in your hummer!! <br>A sense of humour is indispensable. Fortunately, peak absurdity is not yet on the horizon.<br><br>JMG<br>“ I don't think that we got our current materialistic paradigm because it's objectively better than the alternatives”<br>You could from a particular perspective explain human history as a technological arms race. Since its hard to whack someone over the head with an idea and have them stay down, the most aggressive and clever exploiters of any important material resource usually get the whacking stick that gives them the edge. But then of course most materials are finite and this race has no finish line.... positions change..wax and wane.<br><br>Aspergers and neurotypicality<br>The labelling of people as aspergian (did I just invent a word?), is simply a manifestation of psychologys myth of the standard human. Essentially in order to fix broken people psych-xxx's need models of what broken and working people look like so that they know when to act and when they have succeeded.

"Magic" indeed? <br><br>BP Oil Spill, Beach Charade<br><br>Grand Isle, LA - May 29, 2010<br> <br>The President came and went, along with most of the media. I am reminded of a toilet: the bowl filled, business was done, the handle pushed and all the flashing blue lights, black SUVs and media flushed right out of town.<br><br>The school buses return. They had to. Last night I watched a BP spokesman on CBS defend this farcical clean-up, promising they would be back. They are.<br><br>Yet, today's beach clean-up effort is the most ridiculous waste of manpower I have ever witnessed, truly unbelievable, an immense joke, funded by British Petroleum.<br><br>As you scroll through these images, I challenge you to find one spot of oil. Look hard at the pure white hazmat suits, the cute yellow or white booties. See any muck on them? Anywhere? Look hard, very hard, for any oily sheen reflecting from the pool of water, surrounded by a picnic-like atmosphere.<br><br>This beach is cleaner than it has ever been. There is nothing there at all. It is completely sterile of the usual flotsam and jetsam, of seaweed, and of oil. There is nothing on it. Yet, I estimate there are at least a thousand paid workers, making $12-18 an hour, drifting and dawdling, with no purpose or direction on roughly six miles of beach. Yet, right nearby are islands covered with oily slicks to which no one is even paying attention.<br><br>So here I am on Grand Isle, surveying this fiasco. I carry no press credentials, emblems or logos, nor pretend to be other than some white dude taking pictures.<br><br>Apart from a few brave souls, these BP hired clean-up workers are under strict instructions not to speak to the press (which I am not). Within seconds of shooting as many images as possible, I am intercepted by white, paramilitary-cop-wanna-bees, who snap and growl to the workers to, quote, "shut the fuck up and say nothing".<br><br>Personally, I say nothing at all and continue shooting, filming their fake-bullshit badges, Rent-A-Cop black t-shirts and quasi-Special-Forces logos. The badges, I note, say nothing official, no county name, no badge number, not even a reference to BP. They appear to be just internet-purchase costumery.<br><br>They turn their heads, these wanna-bees, mumbling into Walmart walkie-talkies and eventually storming off in embarrassment. They have no authority what-so-ever. This is a total BP sham. Several times I am told to leave the beach as ‘it is under military control', yet no military is present. When I politely press them about this ridiculous contradiction, they fumble for an answer.<br><br>When I do leave the beach, the local (and very real) cops just smile and wave. They know who I am and what I'm doing.<br><br>The lack of Port-a-potties for this huge work force is nauseatingly apparent. Next to the main parking lot is a private campground, where the huge work force has been forced to relieve themselves. To quote a local, "It smells like a goddamn hog pen."<br> <br>I challenge you, one more time, to look for the tiniest spots of oil or any BP logo and I ask, Why, if the company is called ‘British Petroleum', are the proud and productive clean-up crews sporting stars and stripes hat-ribbons?<br><br><a href=magical-thinking.html#c5474307801137370453 title="comment permalink">6/4/10, 11:06 PM</a><br><br>

Some of the First Nations here in America, for example, have ritual systems of immense complexity and richness, easily as intricate as anything you'll find in Western ceremonial magic. As for the compost mysteries, though, that's excellent -- I've long argued that modern Pagans might usefully take up the old practice of making offerings to the earth deities, using a compost bin as the appropriate altar. <br><br>Cherokee, no question, nature will sort things out. I'd prefer that she do it in a way that doesn't involve mass dieoff. <br><br>William, check the data from Greenland ice cores. The reason why we're not 15 degrees F. above ice age temperatures is that things have cooled off considerably since the post-glacial hypsithermal (the period right after the ice age, when global temperatures were about where they'll be when anthropogenic global warming crests). <br><br>Divelly, that's a great example!<br><br>Mxyzptlk, I confess to knowing absolutely nothing about SIAI, and the terms "singularity" and "artificial intelligence" tend to make me roll my eyes -- there's such a huge amount of covertly religious mythology around those concepts these days! Still, if you (and Dr. Vassar) think there's common ground, a conversation could well be worthwhile; I can be reached via info (at) aoda (dot) com. <br><br>Das Monde, good. Tofflerism is arguably the most popular theology of the religion of progress these days, and you're quite right that it's been accepted blindly even by people whose previous experience with triumphalist ideologies should have made them think twice. <br><br>Robert, understood. Still, I use labels such as "Aspergers" because they make certain kinds of communication a bit easier; I can sum up a lot of the things that set me apart from a lot of my contemporaries by that term, and it also helps signal other people with the same set of differences that I have some idea what they're talking about. <br><br>Bill, learning not to be overly literal was a long process for me, and it took a great deal of study of fields where symbol, metaphor, and analogy are right up there in the foreground -- in particular, ceremonial magic, which uses those as core working tools -- to get some facility with them. It's rather like learning to handle casual conversation; what comes very naturally to most other people can be learned through practice and focused study by Aspies. <br><br>Hapibeli, thank you!<br><br>Anna, no, I hadn't heard about that book yet. Thanks for the reference; I'll check it out. <br><br>Gwendolyn, I'm very interested -- and have passed this on to some other people in the peak oil scene. <br><br>Wolf, true enough. The real mage is willing to run the risk of giving advice in advance, though.<br><br>Flanagan, depends on the author, and the book. I'm not a Crowley fan, though. <br><br>Joel, that's fascinating to hear! Though I probably shouldn't be surprised. I've argued for a long time that serious mages need to have a solid familiarity with scientific method, as it happens; I don't know how much likelihood there is that scientists will ever get familiar with the basics of magic, but it's to be hoped for -- there's a good deal more to be talked about there than most people in either tradition tend to recognize. <br><br>Andrew, thank you. As you know, it's in doing the daily work that the rubber actually meets the road. <br><br>Meg, thanks for the link!<br><br>Wordek, I should have guessed you were a Sub-Genius. Hail "Bob," and all that.<br><br>Hapibeli, this is what Gwendolyn was mentioning up above. Magic? Of an inept and self-defeating kind. I'll likely be discussing this in next week's post. <br><br>Bryant, we've got plenty of pierced signs here in western Maryland, too!<br><br><a href=magical-thinking.html#c2194648651349826384 title="comment permalink">6/5/10, 11:39 AM</a><br><br>

At what point did we swap trinkets and stuff for community and what have we lost in doing so? <br><br>I'd appreciate any and all thoughts on this subject, because it does seem to me that (as a society) we have had some pretty heavy magic put onto us all. But again, is that sort of thinking an attempt to allocate blame elsewhere? It can be quite a circular argument, because you have to work out at what point you try to extract yourself from the carousel that is society?<br><br>I've read much about marketing and human communications in an attempt to personally move away from the collective apathy and denial that seems to be such a strong presence in society.

It skipped the common analytical approach of looking for what the disparate views might have in common, like the strong evidence that "peak cheap oil" is the actual thing in short supply. You'd think in a review article like that they might raise the question of how a whole civilization designed to operate on cheap oil would even support it's overhead, let alone grow by leaps and bounds, when that's gone. But no.<br><br>Also glaringly missing was the clear connection between all the "peak this and that's" with "peak money" and how relieving one or an other peak resource constraint for economic sustainability is a very thinly disguised intent to continue multiplying money, forever. That of course pushes "ever higher peak anything" till on balance there's no money left to be made by any means. <br><br>Keynes, Boulding and I have spent the better part of a century persistently pointing to the natural certainty of that as the default nature limit of money in a market economy... not to bother anyone of course with realities when cultural ideology has a more friendly ring.<br><br>Anybody's free to chime in!!<br>phil<br><br><a href=magical-thinking.html#c8820938282772564613 title="comment permalink">6/6/10, 3:35 PM</a><br><br>

No, the old correspondence course on the Cabalistic magic of the Golden Dawn was turned into <a href=http://www.thothpublications.co.uk/greer-paths.html rel=nofollow>my first book</a> back in 1996. These days I teach a number of things by correspondence and otherwise, but that's not one of them. <br><br>Wordek, the details vary, but yes, that's one of the classic Crowley stories. He was actually a very minor figure in his own time; his posthumous popularity is almost entirely a product of the fact that he appealed to the Sixties mentality, which saw him as a sort of proto-hippie. <br><br>Houyhnhnm, that's fascinating. I know exactly nothing about classical horsemanship, but I've noticed that magical training and martial arts training (in which I do have some experience) have very striking parallels; it may be that any discipline that seeks to work with wordless realities comes to have a similar structure. <br><br>Thardiust, most interesting! Thanks for the link. <br><br>Wolf, it's been part of my job description for a decade now. <br><br>K, the wall of denial is starting to crack in a big way; the Times' snide attitude is the last defense before panic sets in. <br><br>Cherokee, it's a long and very complex story, woven out of the interaction between the scientific revolution and the natural process of increasing abstraction that, as Vico points out, is inseparable from the ripening of a civilization toward its death. One way to talk about it is to think of it as a magical spell; another is to use the old story of Faust, and ask how and when we collectively sold our soul for a short period of worldly omnipotence. More on this later. <br><br>Twilight, exactly! And of course we get the same thing here in many different ways, from people who are scared pea-green of the future and are using an assortment of incantations to deal (or avoid dealing) with that fear. <br><br>Mzyxptlk, I'm certainly interested in anything that will encourage people to learn how to think -- a demanding skill, and one that needs much education and regular practice in order to do successfully. As for your moniker -- yes, I caught that; been a while, but I used to read DC comics pretty heavily; my tastes tended to Batman and Green Arrow rather than the kid from Krypton, but I knew the basics. <br><br>Phil, my guess (as I mentioned to K) is that the Times, and the end of the political class for which it's the mouthpiece, are slowly and with desperate unwillingness being forced to confront peak oil. No doubt we'll get every imaginable kind of incantation out of All The News Unfit To Print in the years to come, but a sane assessment of our civilization's prospects will be far off if it ever arrives there.<br><br><a href=magical-thinking.html#c7986297586716867473 title="comment permalink">6/6/10, 9:20 PM</a><br><br>

Obama is as caucasian as many others - he just chooses to portray himself as black, rather than mixed heritage. It has been said that there are very few so-called "whites" in America that don't have some intermingled racial lines.

The one is unfortunately about as likely as the other...</i><br><br>Well, the collective is made up of individuals and once you get enough individuals to take steps away from the capitalist mindset then the collective will move. But the important part is to get rid of the capitalist mindset of eternal exponential growth. I've been doing this with a small bit of success. After all, it's patently obvious that eternal exponential growth on a finite world is impossible.<br><br>I don't try to give a complete vision of what to move to but I do try to open discussion on this. Pointing out how competition inevitably makes things more expensive while also suggesting that competition, in the right areas, can produce benefits so we should be asking if the added costs of competition supply enough benefits. I also point out how cooperation in many things is far better than competition, health services is certainly a good example here. I wrap that up with suggesting that whatever we do we must live within the ecological limits of the the Earth's biosphere. We don't know what those limits are yet but it's fairly obvious that we've surpassed them.<br><br>And, GAH, stuffed up the link in my previous post - left the closing quotes off :(<br><br><a href=magical-thinking.html#c6195540530509216543 title="comment permalink">6/7/10, 7:45 AM</a><br><br>

That I well know as my people on my father's side are Canadian Metis...and once that becomes part of a discussion there is a noticeable change in the 'atmosphere'. There are many in this world who still fear 'blacks' and other races though they tend not to address this or even know it. <br><br>My comment is based solely on recognizeable common opinion.....not hereditary accuracy.

I know because I was downloading your archive for off-line reading, and saving by title, when I realised a discrepancy. (It was claiming I have read this post when I have not; but I knew I had read one of an identical title, so I caught the bug.) Now I am doing by date; it was a silly technical decision anyway.<br><br>But anyway, I have read in far enough by now to notice that you put emphasis on the role of monastic orders in preserving culture.<br>You, however, went on to praise Rabbinical Judaism for cultural preservation, even though it did no such thing—Second-Temple Judaism being a religion that shares nothing with Rabbinical Judaism beyond the Hebraisms and genetic history that the former retains.<br><br>The real heroes of cultural preservation among the Jews are a monastic order seldom recognised here as such: the Essenes. And they have all the hallmarks, including strict gender separation. And they did your favourite thing of preserving libraries in places where basically nobody went. They also did not use high-acid paper, thank God.<br><br>(Keep up the great blog. For all my disagreements with you, there are enough agreements to merit me reading it. I created the system that I just debugged for the express purpose of reading this blog’s entire archive offline. It is open source, available at https://github.com/revence27/Read-Later for those who are curious.)<br><br><a href=magical-thinking.html#c2983157382813726434 title="comment permalink">4/24/12, 10:14 AM</a><br><br>
