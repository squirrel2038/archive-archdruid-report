<span style=font-size:130%>Part Two: The Limits of Magic</span><br><br>The first half of this essay sketched out the unfamiliar terrain that’s beginning to open out in front of the peak oil community as the concept of hard energy limits seeps back out into public awareness, after thirty years of exile in the Siberia of the imagination where our society imprisons its unwelcome truths. One probable feature of that landscape is the rise of revitalization movements among people in the industrial world. Last week I talked about those movements in general terms, but it’s possible to explain them a good deal more clearly by saying that revitalization movements try to cope with drastic and unwelcome social change through ritual action.<br><br>“Ritual is poetry in the world of acts,” according to the influential Druid writer and teacher Ross Nichols; in less gnomic form, ritual is action done for its symbolic meaning rather than its practical value. Most social movements combine ritual with practical action in various ways. What sets revitalization movements apart is that they emerge when practical responses to a changing world are either unworkable or unthinkable, and so the plan of action they offer is entirely a matter of ritual; even those actions that have practical aspects are done because of their symbolic power.<br><br>The wild card here is that ritual can have remarkable properties when it’s applied in the right way, for the right purposes. This is the secret of magic – the art and science of causing change in consciousness in accordance with will, to repeat Dion Fortune’s definition. If what you’re trying to do depends on the choices of conscious beings, magic works. Rosie the Riveter, who’s been discussed in these essays more than once, is an example of successful magic. “We can do it,” her most famous poster said, and millions of American women discovered that they could; housewives who had never handled a machine tool in their lives headed off to factories to build airplanes, tanks, and cannons at a pace that exceeded even the most sanguine hopes of Allied planners, and flooded battlefields around the world with a tidal wave of munitions that swept the Axis powers into history’s dumpster.<br><br>For an even more extreme example, consider the trajectory that created the most dangerous of those same Axis powers. Not much more than a decade before the Second World War began, Germany was a textbook example of a failed state, an economic basket case with a discredited political establishment, riven by internal struggles that hovered close to the brink of civil war. Reasonable methods applied by reasonable men had failed to do anything about these problems. Hitler was not a reasonable man; he understood, better than nearly anyone else at the time, the power of the nonrational to shape human thought and action, and his response to Germany’s disintegration amounted to government by magic. Germany became one vast ritual theater, flooded with symbols, incantations and ceremony. Reasonable men predicted that he would be out of a job in six months; six years later, in total control of a tautly disciplined nation and one of the world’s most fearsome war machines, he declared war on most of the planet, and it took another six years and total defeat to break his grip on the German people.<br><br>There’s a rich irony that one of the few contemporaries of Hitler who could match his understanding of the nonrational was Mohandas K. Gandhi. Gandhi was not a reasonable man, either, but his mind rose as far above the level of reason as Hitler’s sank below it. In many ways, the task of prying loose “the jewel in the crown” of the British Empire from its overlords was a more astonishing feat than pulling Germany out of its post-1918 death spiral, and Gandhi did the job without any of the institutional tools Hitler relied on to work his magic. The spectacle of the largest empire in human history forced to submit to the gentle will of a single elderly mystic may be taken as an example of the positive potential of magic; the cataclysmic failure of the Twelve Year Reich show just as clearly its potential downside.<br><br>The difference in results unfolded partly from the moral distance between the two enchanters. Ethics are as important in magic as sanitation is in surgery, and for the same reason; neglect either one and you can count on things going septic. Still, there are also differences of means and ends, and these bear directly on the theme of this essay. In order to accomplish his purpose, Gandhi needed only to affect the thoughts and decisions of people in Britain, India, and any other countries that might influence one or the other. His work, in other words, was ultimately a matter of causing changes in consciousness, and that was something that symbolic action could and did accomplish.<br><br>Hitler, for his part, started out working on similar lines. To bring his vision of a triumphant Germany into reality, he had to cause changes in the consciousness of the German people, on the one hand, and in the minds of the leaders of other European nations on the other, and the magical knowledge he got on the fringes of the Vienna occult scene proved more than adequate to that task. Once he went past those goals to pursue the fantasy of military conquest, though, he passed out of the range of effects that could be accomplished by changes in consciousness, and into a realm that depended on the hard material realities of oil, steel, and geography. Once he crossed that line he was doomed; magic can transform a failed state into a unified nation, but it can’t make a world empire in an industrial age out of a modestly sized European state with few resources, no petroleum, and no defensible borders.<br><br>All this is simply to say that magic, like any other tool, is very well suited to carry out some jobs and completely useless for others. If the troubles faced by an individual or a community are primarily a function of consciousness, magical methods can be extraordinary effective in dealing with them. If the troubles that have to be faced has its roots in the world of matter, though, there are hard limits to what magic can do. You can’t use incantations and rituals, for example, to put oil in the ground if it was never there in the first place, or if the oil fields have already been pumped dry. You can’t even use magic to run a successful coal-to-liquids program if the net energy of the technology you’re using is too low; Hitler’s regime did its level best to accomplish that, with some of the world’s best scientists and engineers, the substantial coal reserves of occupied Europe, and an unrestricted supply of slave labor – and the Wehrmacht still ran out of fuel. <br><br>These examples are particularly relevant to the present, because the movements led by Hitler and Gandhi both had plenty in common with revitalization movements. Both emerged in response to drastic social stresses resistant to any more practical or reasonable approach – the post-Versailles near-collapse of Germany on the one hand, the economic and social burdens of British imperial rule over India on the other. Both drew heavily on symbolism, incantation, ritual, and the rest of the hardware in the magician’s toolkit, and both became mass movements characterized by the wild enthusiasm and millenarian expectations common to revitalization movements everywhere. The success of Gandhi’s project and the failure of Hitler’s thus points up, among other things, the difference between what a revitalization movement can do and what it can’t.<br><br>That’s of crucial importance just now, because the thing that most people in the industrial world are going to want most in the very near future is something that neither a revitalization movement nor anything else can do. We are passing from an age of unparalleled abundance to an age of scarcity, economic contraction, and environmental payback. As the reality of peak oil goes mainstream and the end of abundance becomes impossible to ignore, most people in the industrial world will begin to flail about with rising desperation for anything that will bring the age of abundance back. Even those who insist they despise that age and everything it stands for have in many cases already shown an eagerness to cling to as many of its benefits as they themselves find appealing.<br><br>The difficulty, of course, is that the end of the age of abundance isn’t happening because of changes in consciousness; it’s happening because of the laws of physics. The abundance we’ve all grown up thinking as normal was there only because a handful of nations burned their way through the Earth’s store of fossil carbon at breakneck speed. Most of the fossil fuel reserves that can be gotten cheaply and quickly have already been extracted and burnt; the dregs that remain – high-sulfur oil, tar sands, brown coal, and the like – yield less energy after what’s needed to extract them is taken into account, and impose steep ecological costs as well; renewables and other alternative energy resources have problems of their own, and have proved unable to take up more than a small fraction of the slack. These limitations are not subject to change, or even to negotiation; they define a predicament that we will all have to live with, one way or another, for a very long time to come.<br><br>What this means is that the fundamental causes of the crisis of modern industrial civilization are not susceptible to magic. We can’t conquer the future under the banner of abundance any more than Hitler could conquer the world under the banner of National Socialism, and for much the same reason: the physical resources to win such a war simply don’t exist. Now it’s true that we could respond to the present crisis by changes in consciousness, using the tools of magic among many others, but those responses would require us to accept the end of the age of abundance and the loss of essentially all of its benefits. That’s something very few people today are willing to do.<br><br>This is why I mentioned earlier that revitalization movements emerge when all practical responses to a changing world are either unworkable or unthinkable. Modern industrial civilization has wedged itself into just such a situation; those responses our political leaders and the bulk of our populations are willing to think about are unworkable, and those responses that might actually keep things from going haywire in fairly dramatic ways are unthinkable. That leaves ritual as the one remaining option.<br><br>If that option could be used in the right way, to change consciousness so that people learned how to think about the unthinkable, accept the end of the age of abundance, recognize the huge gap between what we currently think we need and what we actually need, and retool their lives and expectations to fit a post-abundance world, it could accomplish extraordinary things. The problem here is that it’s not usually possible to get people to use ritual action to achieve something they desperately don’t want to achieve. Magic, again, is the art and science of causing change in consciousness in accordance with will; if the will isn’t there, neither is the magic.<br><br>That leaves the foredoomed but profoundly seductive attempt to make the physical world obey the desires of the majority of industrial humanity by means of ritual action. The Sarah Palin fans chanting “Drill, baby, drill,” as though drilling a hole in the ground magically obliged the Earth to put oil at the bottom of it, are taking tentative steps in that direction. So are the people who insist that we can keep on enjoying the trappings of the age of abundance if we only support a technology, or join a movement, or adopt an ideology, or – well, the list is already long, and it’s going to get much longer in the near future. My guess is that we’ve got a couple of years at most before somebody puts the right ingredients together in the right way, and the first fully fledged revitalization movement begins attracting a mass following with its strident denunciations of the existing order of things and its promise of a bright future reached by what amounts to a sustained exercise in magic.<br><br>Those of my readers who have been paying attention will recognize that this doesn’t mean people will be putting on robes and funny hats and brandishing ornate wands while intoning the names of spirits in whose existence they don’t actually believe. Just as magical incantations in the peak oil scene these days have replaced the old barbarous names with such words of power as “hydrogen economy,” “algal biodiesel,” “advanced petroleum recovery technology” and the like, the rituals that will be practiced by the revitalization movements to come may take the form of community building exercises, protest marches, outdoor festivals, and campaigns for political office. They may even include sensible steps such as weatherstripping homes and building solar greenhouses. What defines an act as ritual, remember, is that it’s done for symbolic rather than practical reasons; weatherstripping a house is a practical action when it’s done for the practical reason of saving a few dozen dollars a year on heat bills, but it becomes a ritual action when it’s done under the conviction that steps of this nature can ward off the end of the age of abundance.<br><br>This is why I suggested at the end of the first half of this post that an effective counterspell against the misplaced magical thinking at the core of the coming revitalization movements is the recognition that there is no bright future ahead. Those words conjured up some remarkably intense reactions among readers of this blog, and that was exactly what they were supposed to do. The sentence needs to be understood with a certain degree of subtlety, though. It does not predict a future of unbroken misery, or claim that there will be no gains to measure against the immense losses most of us will suffer.<br><br>What it means is that the core faith of the age that is passing, the faith that the future will be better than the past or present, has become a delusion. In almost every sense, the future ahead of us will be worse than the present and the recent past The vast majority of us will be much poorer than we have been; many of us will have to worry at least now and then about gettng enough food to stay alive; most of us will have to do without adequate medical care; most of us will not have the opportunity to retire; most of us will die at least a little sooner than we otherwise would have done. The security most of us take for granted, with police and firefighters on call and the rule of law acknowledged even when it’s not equally enforced, will in many places become a fading memory; many areas that have been at peace for a long time will have to cope with the ghastly realities of domestic insurgency or war. All these things will be part of everyday life for the vast majority of us for decades, and on the other side of it lies, not some imagined golden age, but a temporary respite of stabilization and partial recovery that might last for half a century at most before the next wave of crises hits.<br><br>This is the way civilizations decline and fall. It’s our bad luck to be living at the dawn of the second great wave of decline to hit Western civilization – the first, for those who haven’t been keeping track of their history, began in 1914 and ended in the early 1950s – and this wave will probably be a great deal worse than the first, if only because it comes right after the peak of conventional petroleum production and thus has to face a decline in net energy per capita on top of everything else. It’s comforting, and will doubtless be common, to look for scapegoats for the troubled times ahead, but it seems more useful to recognize that this is simply what happens at this point on the curve of history’s wheel.<br><br>Of all the reactions that the first half of this post fielded, though, the ones that interested me most were those that suggested that having a bright future to reach for is the only thing that gives meaning to life. Fortunately, this isn’t even remotely true. Nearly all of our ancestors lived in times when there was no bright future on the horizon; nearly all of our descendants will experience the same thing. The great majority of the former and, no doubt, of the latter as well, found other reasons for living. That’s an equally viable option right now, given a willingness to think the unthinkable, recognize that the age of abundance is ending, and consider the possibility that doing the right thing in a time of crisis, no matter how uncomfortable or challenging the right thing might be, may be a more potent source of meaning than waiting for magic to make a bright future arrive.

I have come to terms with the fact that I'll probably never retire. The past few years have increasingly made me uneasy about the future. The job I have now pays the bills, but I find myself planning for a much different future than I imagined before. It's not that big of a come down, I grew up poor. Still, I imagine the new poor will be starkly different from the modern welfare state poor. I am making the effort to gather knowledge and skills that will be of use in a transitional economy. If they are not immediately transferable, I can at least hone them to the point where the next generation can inherit something. This isn't all bad. I did a basic course on blacksmithing earlier in the year. The work was exhausting, but at the end of each day I felt something different mixed in with the soreness and the sweat and the immense hunger from the physical exertion. Perhaps a small taste of the fortitude required of preceding generations, and a reminder of how removed we are from certain realities facing us in a life without cheap energy.<br><br><a href=#c5653451884331997431 title="comment permalink">6/17/10, 12:06 AM</a><br><br>

Rather, it has given me, as a Christian pastor, a profound sense of duty to work for the practical, here-and-now well-being of the people in my community.

She never uses the term "revitalization movement" or mentions cargo cults, but what she describes - a movement that advises individuals to rid their minds of "negative" thoughts and their lives of "negative" people and keep their attention focused on what they desire in order to attract it - is an exact match for your description. When I was a girl in the Fifties, positive thinking meant people with more ambition than talent reading and rereading Napoleon Hill's <i>Think and Grow Rich!</i>. Today that book's latest descendant, <i>The Secret</i>, is a best seller, and positive thinking, under the trade name "prosperity gospel", has actually replaced Christian teachings in some of this country's best publicized churches. Business leaders started out promoting these ideas among their employees as a way of keeping up morale in the face of layoffs and pressure on the remaining staff to work more hours for lower pay, but then, according to Ehrenreich, they drank the Kool-Ade, too, and worked themselves into a frenzy of overconfidence. Thus they brought about the series of bubbles and busts that has characterized the economy ever since. <br><br>Right now the movement advocates intolerance of "negative" people only on the personal level. (For instance, if your mother belittles your ambitions, your are advised to exclude her from your life.) In the future it could morph into serious messenger-shooting, with prominent members of the peak oil/transition towns/post-carbon movement literally in mortal danger, along with anyone whose personal appearance or known attitudes are even vaguely countercultural. If you've got a counterspell for that, please publish it; it could turn out to be very necessary.<br><br><a href=#c727231149020402225 title="comment permalink">6/17/10, 4:52 AM</a><br><br>

I now understand completely what Financial Permaculture is. It is an incantation for what I am now convinced is the nascent revitalization movement know in some manifestations as Transition Town. I also should add, that though it began as an actual alternative agriculture system with legitimate grass-roots origins, Permaculture has now been subsumed as one of the core facets of this revitalization movement. <br><br>Evidently "Financial Permaculture" had a name before it had a definition. It seems to have been created in the thought that "'Financial Permaculture' sounds like a movement we should pursue; let's figure out what it would mean." I also find extensive discussion of language in the FP/TT writings from our local group (freely available on the web if you search on a few key terms). One of the recurring themes is that when dealing with a "local community" (i.e. non-initiates) you don't use your "own language" for several years, until you have gradually brought them into the first level of trust. This is presented in a way that suggests an implicit understanding that "our language" is the language embodying the "truth" but that you have to introduce the masses to this "truth" gradually. Does this not smack strongly of Arcana that are revealed to first-level initiates only after they have passed a basic level of mastery of the Truth? <br><br>As for rituals, the prominent routine form taken is the Workshop. These people don't even seem to be able to get together for a potluck without then splitting off into breakout groups and making presentations at the end of the evening. The goal seems to be getting everyone on the "same page," with the "same vision," and a consensus as to how to achieve that vision. For the big grand public rituals (the Major Sabbats), one of the preferred forms seems to be the "demonstration project." These are of course intended to show how we can maintain all the comforts of home and 20th Century living no matter what happens in the rest of the world. What irks me about this is that these are almost invariable NEW construction. In an area with high foreclosure rates and plenty of vacant dwellings even before the late "financial crisis," how on earth does letting those rot (all that embodied energy evaporating away) while you truck in loads of bricks, concrete, rebar, straw, lumber, etc. etc. freshly extracted and produced, amount to any sort of "green" and "low-footprint" way to live? What it is, of course, is theatrical. <br><br>This also explains the "paralysis by analysis" phenomenon, where these people spend eons in workshops and demonstration projects that actually leave very little real change on the ground. If your point is to imagine the brighter future, apparently the imagining is the most important part. If you really attempted to implement this stuff on a major scale, you'd find out very fast why it just ain't gonna fly. And that might undermine the whole movement. <br><br>So there it is -- the vision of the brighter future in nice tidy little local economies with local currencies, green jobs (with health benefits, retirement plans, and good pay in local cash), universal access to solar-powered broadband through ubiquitous WiFi, lights that still come on when you flip a switch, healthy varied food that grows itself with no labor required (a central mantra of permaculture -- the stuff just drops out of the trees into your waiting baskets), and houses that maintain themselves at 72F year-round with no external energy sources needed. That's your Transition Town powered by Financial Permaculture. Oh, and it is of course ethnically diverse, open and accepting, even though the people now working on founding it, at least in our local manifestation, are white as the driven snow and from a rather narrow band of socioeconomic and political origins...<br><br><a href=#c345619867101481912 title="comment permalink">6/17/10, 6:25 AM</a><br><br>

I am an optimist intoxicated from the magical elixir of human ingenuity and ardor. I too have felt my whole life, like many others I'm sure who read this blog, that with hard work and sheer will power, humanity can accomplish anything it should desire. A human condition or behavior? Hardwired or manufactured? I know not. All I know is that it is complete desperation to overcome any obstacle(s) that come my way. <br><br>I am not naive though. I have always been aware of biophysical limits (long before the recent fetish of today and prior to my knowledge of the Club of Rome Report identifying limits to growth long ago) and the necessity for humanity to acknowledge them and scale down our influence to "prosper" (whatever that means) within them. We live on a finite planet. It has always just made sense to me. This materialized for me more later in life when I learned through my studies in Human Ecology to be the carrying capacity of a specific bioregion at a specific moment in time--depending on a number of biophysical realities or limits.<br><br>What has resonated with me the most from this week's post, which has inspired me to participate in this discussion, is that although I am aware of the sobering reality that there is no bright future ahead, I can't help but think there is because of my need to foster a prosperous life for my children because I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE them and I want them to know that I did not bring them in to this world to be doomed to the perils of the modern world. Every time I think of this I can't help but feel utterly powerless to the depths of my entire being because I can envision how troublesome and how destitute life will inevitably be for those who are the most ill prepared to deal with the challenges to our survival that lay ahead.<br><br>It seems that no matter how much my family or my local community prepares, there will be many who are close to me, or not for that matter, that will face extreme dislocation, displacement, starvation, etc. and it paralyzes me to no end.<br><br>I want nothing more than to harness this desperation and mobilize it for the common good.

That when you dice up infinite reality up you're going to have inherent flaws in your thinking. Alan Watts said something to the effect of western thought being like a flash light, and eastern though like a flood light, each useful in some situations and limited in others. It seems to me that the failure of Western Civ to adapt to energy limits is due to the ignorance of its intellectual limits. <br><br>In financial discussions I always bring up Long Term Capital Management as an example of the fallibility of models; one wrong assumption, in an endless sea of variables, and your model is garbage.

I'm a relatively new reader, have been following for a few months now. Of all the peak oily sources out there I find this one of the most helpful - encouraging of quiet reflection, and hopefully some actual action on my part soon. <br>I grew up in the UK, and then moved to the US in my late twenties. I did the full-on yuppie thing, working in the tech industry, thinking that future was golden, not just bright. Ha! But I was raised by a gardener and a practical man, so I have some useful skills still. My garden is coming into good use now, and we get maybe 10-20% of our food from it. What you're helping me understand, or perhaps just accept, is that the best we can do is muddle through and try to live as well as we can in the present, while a lot of big historical stuff swirls around us. <br> My UK family were mid-level functionaries in the British Empire, in India and China, and lived and often died through the great turning points of Imperial decline: high point around the 1880s, Boxer Rebellion, WWI and II, loss of India and Britain's final acceptance of the end after Suez. It took many generations for all of that to unfold, and a lot of clinging and hoping that a small country (with even fewer resources than Germany) could continue to run the world. It seems ridiculous looking back on it, but that's what people tried to do, across generations. <br>On a day to day basis, many Brits were able to handle the most difficult times with a certain stoicism and quiet determination ("Keep Calm and Carry On"). By the 70's the country was at a very low ebb. So the sense of excitement and renewal that came with the return of prosperity in the 80s and 90s (partly fueled by North Sea oil) was strong. We didn't have an empire, but we were cool and wealthy. And we had hedge funds! Point is, that instinct for a brighter future dies hard, and it comes back to life pretty easily. God knows what it's going to be like here! <br><br>Yours in calmly carrying on,<br><br>Yupped<br><br><a href=#c5981862980475210857 title="comment permalink">6/17/10, 7:27 AM</a><br><br>

By 1954 that was no longer true. The fact that we've got a whole bunch of neat technological toys that they didn't have in 1914 doesn't change the fact that Western industrial civilization is a great deal less dominant and more fragile than it was. <br><br>Janette, the US is actually quite an old nation --it hasn't changed its government or, except for its westward expansion, changed its borders in more than 200 years, which is relatively rare. The oldest European nations, for that matter were invented out of much more ragged and diverse feudal states in the late 17th century, but most of them have had drastic political changes and boundary shifts since then, and quite a few didn't come into existence until the 19th century.

Of course, they would be doing so deliberately in the face of much evidence that the assumption was false.

I see two courses of action:<br><br>Do I now become active in the movement, and attempt to interject things that (in my own mind of course, I'm too postmodern to think I have the true answers anymore than they do) might increase the level of reality? Ideas such as "I think you overemphasize consensus, I think we all should be working on different pages with different ideas, that way we develop a bigger toolkit and have better chances of finding things that actually work." Or, "Why all the emphasis on 'finance?' Local economies have existed for many millenia, and many have not had much of a financial sector. Maybe we should take a broader view of what 'economy' encompasses and not be so fixated on money." Or, "Given that we already have a housing stock of thousands of buildings in the county, many of which are vacant or in disrepair, maybe we ought to think about developing and demonstrating ways to bring these existing houses into the post-peak world, rather than thinking we'll just rebuild the entire housing infrastructure from scratch."<br><br>OR, do I just keep my head down, do my own thing, and try not to get in their way, letting people just see what I am doing and forming their own opinions of it?<br><br>Many would reflexively say "obviously you should get involved and try to make a difference." But I see potential major down sides to this. I take the chance of being branded as a trouble maker, perhaps even an enemy, and becoming a pariah, especially if a monolithic Transition Town movement actually rises to the seats of power in the community. Life in rural areas can be precarious if you manage to make yourself into an outcast -- there are good reasons that religion and politics used to be off-limits in social discourse. <br><br>Any thoughts?<br><br><a href=#c4042993308365920905 title="comment permalink">6/17/10, 8:25 AM</a><br><br>

I have a lot-and-a-half which I just finished planting, after ripping up 1800 sq feet of sod with a spade shovel and my hands, to add to the 300 sq feet of garden I already had. I'm down to about $100 dollars, without employment, with a vision for taking the house sustainably off the grid, but without the resources to put that vision fully into practice. <br><br>I've written a book, and a script for a bit of Sacred Theatre, with dances including swords, deer horns and a diamond willow stave, theatre I intend as the primary marketing vehicle for the book. The advance manuscript, theatre script and business and marketing plans are with a dozen friends/editors/investors I care about and admire, who I know will tell me the truth. So far, the response has been positive, but no capital is as yet forthcoming. <br><br>My last name is Duncan, which is also the name of the first two kings of Scotland. They were immature fiends who brought little but misery to their people. My life is in part meant to be a redemption of that name. I am also in service to the Goddess, in service to the Earth. These are frightening times. People will be looking for answers. I am prepared to give them one. It is not THE answer, if that is what they are looking for, which none can give but to him or herself; but it is a story of the answer I have found for myself. <br><br>As a man of Celtic heritage, I am asking for a blessing from the Arch-Druid of America, whatever that blessing might be, if only a prayer. Thank you again for your words. I know of no one speaking more clearly about what we face as a species.

If our sons do not begin to use material things as a measure of their self-worth then they should be better equipped to deal with the scarcity of resources in the future.<br><br><br>Of course this all depends upon their ability to withstand the cultural pressures. But as the prices of consumer goods starts to increase (reversing the trend of the past 4 decades) and TV’s start to get more expensive hopefully our culture will start to put less value on these things. I do not so much fear my sons reaction to the upheaval caused by the death of the consumer based economy as much as my own generation (I am 39) as I do the 20 something’s who do not yet realize that the world that was promised to them is unobtainable and their parents and grandparents wasted the opportunity in the 1970’s to ease the transition in one last blast of over consumption.<br><br><br>We do go through rituals of increasing our energy efficiency, localizing our food sources, and trying to decrease our reliance on fossil fuels.

We are doing them now by choice to try to decrease the amount of personal upheaval that the rest of society will feel when they are forced to make the same changes.

I thought this would be the fun sort of "bull session" my dad described to me as the best part of college life, where people hang out and talk about whatever's on their mind. But instead, the leader had the mystical idea that it had to be organized as a Workshop, and we therefore followed the formalized breakout and present model, stifling the real creative energy of a casual conversation. Why did we need to organize things in this way for a simple gathering of 6 to 8 students? Nobody seemed to understand the underlying magic (does anyone ever understand the magic inherent in their beliefs?), but of course, nobody took any real action as a result of these formalistic conversations.

April deConick's blog "Forbidden Gospels" has some excellent posts on this whole subject. She is a fine scholar who can read the old Gnostic manuscripts in their original Coptic.<br><br>As for the lineage, P. P. Quimby taught Mary Baker Eddy. (She was also heavily influenced by Emmanuel Swedenborg and his American followers. This was the source of her striking idea that God is equally Father and Mother.) <br><br>Eddy taught Emma Curtis Hopkins, but soon found her pupil to be an independent thinker and disowned her for that. Hopkins had very many influential pupils, and did not mind that some of them were also independent thinkers who eventually founded their own distinct organizations -- "new religious movements," to use the current academic jargon. <br><br>Malinda E. Cramer arrived at much the same set of Gnostic ideas independently in San Francisco, and later drew heavily on the writings of Eddy and Hopkins as well as several others; but the S.F. Earthquake and Fire ended her life in 1906, and the organization that she had founded in that city did not long survive her death.<br><br>Among the many first- and second-generation pupils of Hopkins, a few elaborated systems of magic. The most influential of them was William Walker Atkinson, author of _Mind-Power: The Secret of Mental Magic_ and the founder of the Yogi Publication Society, which has kept a number of significant occult and magical books in print for a century now.<br><br>None of these people (except perhaps Hopkins) seems to have known anything about the Gnostics of Late Antiquity. However, several of them, including Eddy, had some awareness of magic and came up with their own theories about how it might work.<br><br><a href=#c8362691598447873565 title="comment permalink">6/17/10, 7:47 PM</a><br><br>

Good for you. <br><br>Moose, funny you should mention that. I took the train home from the conference today, and there was an Amish family in the seats just behind mine, father, mother and children all neatly dressed, the kids well behaved, talking to one another in their dialect. They'll do fine. <br><br>Avery, while it's not my primary tradition, I've also been initiated in the RDNA, and I'd sooner drink the waters of life than attend a seminar any day! <br><br>K, thanks for the clarification. I think people like to forget that the British Empire was as brutal as any -- the British invented the concentration camp, for example, in the Boer war.<br><br>Lamb, I wonder how many people engaged in marketing all that discontent realize that they're creating forces that will tear industrial civilization apart. <br><br>Gregory, thanks for the details. I grant that one doesn't have to be a member of a faith to understand that faith's ideas -- though there are dimensions of experience that are only open to the full participant; it's simply that, since I'm not a Christian, I haven't studied much in the way of modern Christian thought. <br><br>Justin, er, I'm going to take issue with just one phrase from your comment, not because you didn't say anything else worth noting, but because this phrase suggests to me that you haven't grasped the core of what's going on. You say, "before man invents a way out of the scarcity paradigm"; that's very nearly a perfect expression of the delusion that rules industrial civilization -- the fantasy that scarcity is just something in our heads ("a paradigm") and that we can replace it with something else just by being clever. <br><br>As long as you think that, the future is going to blindside you. Scarcity is one of the fundamental principles of existence; it does not go away just because we pretend it's not real; and it's only by grasping the fact that every living thing must always contend with scarcity that we can approach the world in anything like a sane manner. <br><br>Professor, not quite. I'm not interested in any kind of revitalization movement; I'd like to get some thoughts out there that will be useful when the revitalization movements are over and done with, people have finally grasped that the space brothers or whoever aren't going to rescue us from the consequences of our own actions, and those who haven't arranged to be raptured onto imaginary spaceships a la Heaven's Gate buckle down to the question of what to do now. <br><br>Joel, I haven't -- I'll have to check it out. I enjoy Brin's SF, though of course you're right that he has the common rationalist habit of despising what he's never taken the time to understand. <br><br>Don, it's a profoundly debased gnosticism, because gnosis is knowledge that transcends and transforms the ordinary world, and what these people are pushing (like <i>The Secret</i> et al.) is an attempt to gain a privileged position within the ordinary world. From the perspective of the old Gnostics, they're slaves of the demiurge, seeking power over the world of matter rather than seeking to transcend that world and enter into the aeonic realm of light.<br><br>Journey, exactly. When it's a gesture that's contradicted by the rest of a person's life, it's not a baby step, it's a fashion statement. <br><br>Laura, agreed.<br><br>Skunk, nope.

I like the way Robert Anton Wilson framed it in his book about the fundamental materialists and their mantra of, "It's only a coincidence, It's only a coincidence, It's only a coincidence..." If one convinces themself of something long enough, one starts to believe it and make it seem true within one's experience of reality.<br><br>The only difference between the fundamental materialists he critiqued, and those you are critiquing, is the mantra seems to be just now, somewhere along the lines of, "Something will save us, something will save us, something will save us..." Of course, something will save us, but it won't be the inhabitant of an imaginary palace with roads paved in gold, nor the combination of one million photovoltaics and tidal turbines -- although some things along those lines may help a few folks out. What's going to "save" us is right beneath our feet, right here and right now. And if there isn't much soil to be had, it can be brought into existence very simply, the simplest of all magic or alchemy. Let's talk about the compost pile.<br><br>And to touch on the point Bill brings up about permaculture or transition towns being the centerpiece of some new fangled revitalization movement. It's quite possible that those terms could be used, but one thing that is largely overlooked is the foundation -- much like the stone the builders rejected -- that is Bill Mollison's writings and theory (particularly A Designer's Manual). Critiquing permaculture doesn't make much practical sense, because permaculture isn't a thing or a product, nor is it something done -- it isn't simply a way to garden or grow food(although the garden is a powerful metaphor). One of my mentors refers to permaculture as a framework for seeing the connections between elements in our human existence. It isn't static and it isn't fit for consumption.<br><br>Most of the critics, from my interaction, haven't read much or any of the literature, nor have they taken much time to give any of the design process or principles a go, and even fewer have wrapped their heads around the concepts, theories and simple observational practices we have forgotten in our domesticated reality.

I stopped using the word "Permaculture" in relation to anything I might do myself years ago. <br><br>I do hope the organized "movement" does not actually wind up impeding the real relocalization of our economy here, with its emphasis on finance and attracting "green business" from outside sources. The actual seeds I see of what looks to me like a real nascent local economic rebirth and de-suburbanization are from entirely different directions. I was disturbed last Monday at a discussion and Q/A forum for our county mayoral candidates (open field this year, incumbent died, interim mayor not running). None of them mentioned anything about agriculture in their economic visions, just the old worn out slogans of attracting industry back to the area; they're just betting on "green industry" (isn't that an oxymoron?) now. When I questioned two of them privately later, one had clearly not thought much about it and the other said "I just leave that all to the [name of the Transition Town/Financial Permaculture group]." If she leaves it all to them, ain't nuthin' ever gonna happen! <br><br>I had been thinking that local government would become more important as federal and state gov'ts gradually sink under impossible financial burdens and political gridlock.

I'm always troubled by activists who claim that there are quick fixes for the problems and predicaments of our society. I've noticed an increase in the "If only we'd embrace nuclear energy" articles flowing through the Australian media recently... There is a lot of uranium here, but it's a finite resource too and we're selling quite a bit of it.<br><br>I've also noticed a core theme for many commenter's on this blog in recent weeks. It focuses on the oft repeated concerns that parents have for their children given peak oil and resource depletion in general. It seems to me a touch hypocritical to express these concerns from the comfort of a Western society. I express this point of view because even in decline individuals in Western societies still have access to consume greater resources than their peers in the third world. It's a predicament as well as being a conflict of interest to be concerned about peak oil and/or general resource depletion and express a desire to maintain the status quo.<br><br>I've travelled in the third world and people there eke out an existence as best they can. For all of the doomers out there, it is an existence and not the end of the world itself. The only thing separating Western societies and the third world are our infrastructure, access to cheap energy and societal structures. It's a thin facade at best.<br><br>If you're worried about your children then insulate yourselves from the inevitable changes that will overtake our societies over the next decade or so. Also try to remember that your comfort and the comfort of your children comes at the expense of many people in the third world and is at the end of a long supply line in the tribute economy that we in Western societies have the good fortune to exist in.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><a href=#c448656228565144353 title="comment permalink">6/18/10, 2:16 AM</a><br><br>

One of them was Warren Felt Evans, a former Swedenborgian minister who had developed "Mental Science," a metaphysical healing practice somewhat similar to Quimby's and Eddy's; also Annetta and Julius Dresser.

Quite obviously, the overwhelming majority of both Americans and Europeans would disagree with your interpretation. Key word being “interpretation.” You may well be right, but certainly most in the West interpret that period as one of advance. Definitely something to ponder further.<br><br>I find it very interesting that in responding you say that we “got a whole bunch of neat technological toys” but nothing more. It seems to echo a trend I’ve noticed, that rather than come back down to earth after a decline, our society’s viewpoint becomes perverted to accommodate both the wished-for progress and the actual retreat all at once. I think this is displayed very prominently in the way, although the average household’s real wages have been declining since the 1970s, the middle class still believes that their standard of living has increased (flat screen TVs, iPhones, and Facebook, need I say more?). Like you say, returning to a 1970s, or prior, level of technology and lifestyle is unthinkable. <br><br>Recently I was looking for web news coverage of the high youth unemployment rate. I’m no socialist, but the most objective perspective I could only find on the situation was at The World Socialist Web Site, not a mainstream media outlet. It stood out clear as day, and I think this is very significant, that the mainstream culture-shapers have glossed over the existence of 25%+ youth unemployment. Rather than face the problem, they pervert reality and say, hey, the real problem is our definition of the word “youth.” <br><br>In a New York Times article entitled “Long Road to Adulthood Is Growing Even Longer,” the head researcher (high priest?) of one study chided “we’re still living with the archaic idea that people enter adulthood in their late teens or early 20s.” Rather than face reality, we’ve perverted our perception of it. <br><br>You are right that the decline has already begun. Rather than acknowledge the growing number of unemployed, unmarried adults (job loss, community decay= negative spin), we simply rework the definition of adult (cultural “progress”= positive spin). How much more of this perversion will be going on in the future? Lots. If you think about it, there are many examples in which this is already happening, such as the 1914-1950 thing.<br><br>If you like, go ahead and compare these two articles, and decide for yourself which one more accurately reports, unbiased, what’s actually happening:<br>From The New York Times: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/13/us/13generations.html?src=me&amp;ref=general<br>From The World Socialist Web Site<br>http://www.wsws.org/articles/2010/feb2010/yout-f08.shtml<br><br><a href=#c7248471041072847488 title="comment permalink">6/18/10, 6:07 AM</a><br><br>

That is a dodge. I understand perfectly well what the underlying concepts for permaculture are, I have read Mollison's stuff. I have a Ph.D. in Ecology from the University of Georgia (the House that Odum Built), I was on a first-name basis with both of the Odum brothers (E.P. and H.T.). I worked as research faculty in ecosystem science at U. Ga. and Colorado State for many many years before leaving Academia to be a hillbilly trucker/farmer. I'm not some uninitiated or ignorant basher. <br><br>The original conceptual framework of "permaculture" is mostly sound; from the perspective of an ecosystem scientist, it is also mostly pretty elementary, almost trivial. Everything is interconnected, every component has multiple functional relations, one thing's waste is another thing's treasure, yada yada yada, yeah, 1+1=2, we know this. The body of stuff labeled permaculture is an interesting compendium of ideas and techniques from many different sources, but there is really nothing original there except for a massive amount of jargon. <br><br>And it is in the jargonification that it leaves reality and becomes A Movement (tm). With jargon you get slogans, with slogans you get momentum, with momentum you lose actual self-critical analysis and feedback, and often also lose real meaningful action, replacing it with flash and noise. Permaculture appears to have made this transition during the last decade; I think i is too far gone to rescue at this point.<br><br><a href=#c3908025044516795946 title="comment permalink">6/18/10, 12:46 PM</a><br><br>

If you don't know the limitations, problems, and flaws of a tool, you don't actually know how to use that tool. <br><br>Bill, individual action is the starting place for anything worth doing right now. If individuals lead, by making changes in their own lives, eventually local governments (among others) will follow. <br><br>Mageprof, I look forward to both of your books. <br><br>Meg, er, the alchemists said over and over again, "our gold is not the common gold." It amazes me how many people don't seem to be able to hear that straightforward statement, and still claim that the old alchemists thought they could make metallic gold out of base metals. That said, the rest of your comment is quite sound. <br><br>Tristan, a lot of Germans badly wanted to be citizens of a conquering nation. A lot of Indians wanted to be citizens of an independent one. How many Americans want to be citizens of an impoverished agrarian society with a fraction of the wealth and an even smaller fraction of the technological toys they have today? <br><br>Cherokee, it seems to me that those who love their children and want the best for them ought to get them the knowledge and skills they'll need to thrive in a deindustrial world.

Those who aren't fond of socialism might want to get the word out that when the only people talking about a massive and obvious social problem are on one corner of the fringe, that corner of the fringe can very quickly become the new center...<br><br>Shiva, a lot of people like to look at the future through that particular set of rose-colored glasses. I suspect the reality will be a lot less palatable. <br><br>Ric, I gather that they've rewritten the Sermon on the Mount to say "Blessed are the rich, privileged and comfortable." Gah. <br><br>Holger, thank you! Bateson's certainly worth the read, as much for his lapses of logic as for his very considerable achievements.

Still, note the context of my counterspell. I said that there's no bright future, not that there can be no bright present. <br><br>Bill, I hope you're wrong about that last point. Still, we'll see. <br><br>Isochroma, do you really think that all that hyperbole and over-the-top denunciatory language does anything to make your ideas convincing to anybody who doesn't already agree with you? <br><br>Steve, saying "things won't be all that bad" is an incantation, not a reasoned response.

In a future of petroleum shortage, you may not get it, or the next one, or the one after it...<br><br>Mxyzptlk, if I were aboriginal I'd probably point a bone in Hanson's direction; that's a very harsh redefinition of the subtle and rich concept of the dreamtime! I'd point out also that our age is far from unique by being guided by "delusions," if by this term you mean (in less judgment-laden language) beliefs that are based on emotion rather than experience; every age of human history falls into the same category. It's just that the beliefs that were adaptive in the last three centuries are becoming catastrophically maladaptive as we watch. <br><br>Das Monde, good. You're paying attention.

It does sound like at least some of the activists in your area are pushing their own ideologies under the TT label.<br><br>(It's worth going back to the source here, and realizing that the original TT ethos is far from ideological, more similar to JMG's statement "...the most effective strategy will be a matter of muddling through, trying to deal with each stage of the descent as it comes into sight...".)<br><br>So, you might consider a "middle way" between your options: it's possible that the local movement isn't monolithic -- sit in for a while, playing the part of a total newbie, get to know the different folks and their motivations, then start asking questions. You may find some folks who'd prefer to be taking a pragmatic tack, and would appreciate the company. If it turns out they've all swallowed the Kool-Aid, back away slowly...<br><br>Later you say: "I had been thinking that local government would become more important as federal and state gov'ts gradually sink under impossible financial burdens and political gridlock. Now I'm not so sure..." Well, local <i>governance</i> will become more important (and it will exist in some form, like it or not); the problem will be making it work on behalf of the governed.<br><br>JMG, in your comment of 6/17/10 7:13 PM you speak of "... a permaculture type ...".

Would you expect Holmgren or Mollison to have acted the same in that situation?<br><br>In general, it seems that we're going to be encountering a varied mix of movements, some based on pragmatics, using principles that have worked before, but are still constantly being tested, and other movements of the kind you've outlined in the post. (And still others that embody some of each, to varying degrees.)

Does complexity and susceptibility to incantations go hand in hand? <br><br>The reason I ask this is because I've noticed that as we progress as a society the layers of complexity in regulations, laws and rules that relate to all sorts of things increase. <br><br>As these layers of complexity increase, it has the adverse effect of dumbing people down. People aren't necessarily dumber, but they become more accepting of things and situations because their breadth of understanding can only stretch so far. The knowledge base of humanity is pretty broad!<br><br>As people become more accepting of things and situations out of necessity, are they then more open to incantations? Is one a reaction to the other?

As for the specific detail I mentioned back then -- er, my memory just at the moment is no better than yours, but the crucial thing to watch for is salvaging of basic resources from infrastructure on the one hand, and simple abandonment of noncritical infrastructure on the other, so the latter may have been the thing I mentioned. <br><br>Wolf, I don't know that there was a single moment that defined the peak of the industrial age -- a lot of curves peaked over a period of half a century or so -- but the splitting of the atom will do as well as any. <br><br>Cherokee, that's a good question. My immediate sense is no -- people are susceptible to incantation in any context, simple or complex; it's one of the less constructive consequences of our innate gift of language that we try to use words to do things that they can't do, like put oil back in the ground. Learned helplessness, on the other hand, does seem to increase with social complexity, which might predispose people to pursue incantation as the only way of action they can imagine.<br><br><a href=#c4728647549793830147 title="comment permalink">6/19/10, 5:36 AM</a><br><br>

As for the Transition Town movement as a revitalization movement, rhetoric isn't always a safe guide here; lines like "somewhere much better to live than our current alienated consumer culture based on greed, war and the myth of perpetual growth" can be found in plenty of contexts, most of which aren't even close to being revitalization movements. <br><br>I grant that it's nonsense, and dangerous nonsense at that; it's hard to think of a delusion more destructive than the fantasy that people can be made to behave like angels by changing their society -- but the same line is as likely to be empty rhetoric, or meretricious manipulation, or sheer handwaving as it is to indicate a nascent revitalization movement. <br><br>Joanhello, bingo.

Yes, there was a somewhat brutal presentation by Stoneleigh of Automatic Earth - but this was the first time finance had been formally on the programme in four years. <br><br>Second, in the session in housing I joined there was a strong consensus that building new homes is a tiny part of the story; we talked mainly about oractical new ways to share existing space, and of different approaches to the insulation of 30 million (just in the UK) existing houses.<br><br>Third, the culture and indeed rules of association of the Transition movement are the opposite of 'monolithic'. The diversity of age, background and outlook of the 300 people there was remarkable. Indeed they (we) agree strongly with your main conclusion: 'we all should be working on different pages with different ideas, that way we develop a bigger toolkit and have better chances of finding things that actually work'.<br><br>JMG informs that the hallmark of a revitalization movement is that its actions are taken 'for symbolic rather than practical reasons... under the conviction that steps of this nature can ward off the end of the age of abundance.' In my experience Transition Towns is the opposite of that. <br><br>@ JMG, neither did I encounter 'empty rhetoric, or meretricious manipulation, or sheer handwaving'.

Most intellectuals miss the fact that every action/thought/reaction is an endless cycle of ritual generated from habit on top of earlier learned habit which....in a given lifetime....will have been learned basically....in the mothers womb. Therein lies a plethora of examples to why it is so difficult to produce objectivity when we reproduce from such subjective backgrounds. After many years of delving into memories to sort what was real from what was constructed I slowly began to graphically realize that we see visions...or dream in REM...before we are born. The discovery of REM experienced in fetus to a degree before birth of 90% led me to even deeper analysis concerning patterned behaviour. It stimulated memories of a very early time before control mechanisms take precedence and the process of social integration distorts the emotional imagery to a more pragmatic relevance.<br><br>It is a strong influence on the arguments of why some people are predisposed to certain attitudes while others are not. This fact can certainly impact a willingness to view some situations with bombastically based opinion rather than substantial personal experience. The reality of 'ritual' as a enhancer to produce consciousness changes is speculative among the uninitiated at best.<br><br><a href=#c99095088851632402 title="comment permalink">6/19/10, 11:59 PM</a><br><br>

I read an article in a national newspaper 2 years ago that prompted me to attend an official TT training event in Totnes (capital of TT, just 40 miles from where I live). Lots of ritual at that event (note: I'm suspicious of the reasons for asking everyone to shut their eyes at the beginning of a 'workshop') and I didn't really like all I saw. Something that struck me as odd with the initial 'instructions' to local groups was that at least one person should have permaculture training. My initial reaction was 'why?'. I've since read Holmgren's 'Permaculture' and enjoyed the book, though his ideas are very oriented towards the landscape in which he lives. I find many who call themselves permaculturalists try to apply his actions to their own environment, even when it's not appropriate. It's as if they have lost the ability to think for themselves. Also permaculture seems to have become the brandname for 'sustainability' and there are more courses, videos, CDs and would-be permaculture entrepreneurs than you can shake a stick at. However I haven't come across a permaculture holding that pays for itself. <br>Despite all the decentralist text in the original TT literature it seems that every 'official' TT group is effectively franchised (yes that includes Tranistion US) by an unaccountable little group of people in Totnes. (Am I wrong?). There's something about the mixture of career activists, well-meaning middle-class greenies and insecure people who need to 'belong' that sends shivers down my spine when I look at some TT material. Despite this TT has changed my life because I have come to realise that the 'community' is truly the place to get things done and so it has brought this ex-activist out of retirement. It's also brought me to this website! But I'm sincerely applying my actions to ALL my neighbours - not just the pleasant ones - and I'm treating it as a lifetime exercise, not just a publicity stunt. <br>By the way, have you noticed that Transition seems to have passed a watershed recently? At the recent conference in South Devon (was it a UK or an international conference?) the Transition Gospel has been re-launched in a completely new form, a speaker from The Automatic Earth was allowed to deliver a distinctly non 'happy-clappy' message and a certain amount of nostalgia for the history of Transition was evident. Could be a sign of maturity or could be a realisation that Transition has peaked in the UK.<br><br><a href=#c588702656904455872 title="comment permalink">6/20/10, 1:48 AM</a><br><br>

Americans and Brits remain quite different in their fundamental approaches to society, a current that flows all across the political spectrum.

The free enterprise, free market mentality is deeply entrenched here, even among progressives (more than most American progressives will ever realize about themselves). We also remain obsessed with the new-and-shiny rather than the old-but-restored.

It surprised me that this was (apparently) such shocking, revelatory, and unexpected information; these facts have been glaringly obvious in the last few years, and quite evident to anyone who cared to look for decades. This is part of the fundamental fabric of the global industrial economy within which "transition" will happen whether it occurs by design or by accident. It's been a major recurring theme of many peak oil websites, including this one. Hmmm...<br><br><a href=#c4034671419677571433 title="comment permalink">6/20/10, 12:31 PM</a><br><br>

Yes, I heard about Stoneleigh's presentation at Totnes -- a fascinating turn of events. The big question now is how the TT movement responds to that. Do TT people deal with the fact that the future is not going to be happy and abundant no matter what they do? Or do they decide that the TT movement is the sole shining alternative to a future of abject misery, and go on a proselytizing tear?

But the point I was trying to make, perhaps poorly, was that permaculture isn't a Thing ("a thing is a think" as Alan Watts said) that can be critiqued.<br><br>The way I comprehend permaculture is as a word to describe a design system or approach. Since design is the basis of everything humans and all beings do, permaculture is less about describing something in particular (like a garden) and more about describing how to approach, design, or think about the things we do or create (like build soil, place and design housing, gardens, farms or interact with other humans and plants in our communities). So by critiquing permaculture as a Thing, we in essence see the forest for the trees. <br><br>So it's necessary that the design methods, actions, means, practices etc. being employed to grow food, interact with other humans or carry out economic activity be tested and critiqued. After all, the only way to improve on anything is by critiquing and testing and realizing that a lot of the time we don't know what we are doing. It seems that this is where permaculture as a design system has it's strengths -- using observation (think tracking or nature awareness, site assessment and analysis), research, and ecological feedback loops (along with a million more tools) as a guide to improve our designs, our reality, our consciousness or whatever it may be.<br><br>But ultimately it doesn't matter what we call what we do to get by with less energy. Across a lot of the planet where permaculture is being used, people do it out of practical necessity -- not because it's trendy or sounds cool. There are no secure supply lines, supermarkets or safety nets for when a crop fails due to drought. So mulching makes a lot of sense, as does saving seed, planting trees, getting to know the people who live nearby, as well as catching rainwater where one lives, etc. Call it permaclture, call it life, call it magic.<br><br>So to sum up my point -- by criticizing permaculture as a Thing, we corner the term into something that it isn't. Forests aren't simply trees and soil isn't simply dirt. Does that make sense?<br><br><a href=#c4396901465903757732 title="comment permalink">6/20/10, 2:32 PM</a><br><br>

In my opinion this is a little difficult when considering the possible effects of peak oil and climate change. That's why the Stoneleigh appearance at the conference is interesting. Agreed, the subject matter is not new.<br>Up to now I've been reading Chris Martenson on economics. CM seems to emphasise inflation and currency collapse, whilst Stoneleigh emphasises deflation and banking collapse. This confuses me at the moment and seems to reflect the political divide in this country at the moment.<br>(I'm actually participating in a TT event shortly - my local official TT does not have the word 'Transition' in its name and I respect all the people that I have met there).<br>As for transatlantic cultural differences - I'm thinking that our underlying level of jaded cynicism will protect us better than your new world natural enthusiasm.<br><br><a href=#c8367600977774371042 title="comment permalink">6/20/10, 4:56 PM</a><br><br>

Any human concept can be critiqued; the laws of thermodynamics can be critiqued, formulated as they are in human language by human minds with an incomplete comprehension of the reality they represent. If permaculture is a way of viewing the world which directs one's design principles, then of course that can be critiqued. If you are saying that it is so generalized as to be able to encompass anything, then that CERTAINLY can be critiqued as being so vague it is meaningless! By saying that it cannot be critiqued because it is not a thing, you rather seem to be saying that is is some fundamental layer of truth in the cosmos that exists by definition. I don't believe scientific thought accepts the existence of anything without critical analysis, not even that 1+1=10. <br><br>Regardless of all that, permaculture MOVEMENTS are undeniably "things" that are exceedingly subject to criticism. And should welcome it. If criticism does not make your ideas stronger, it is because you are not listening to it. You may conclude that the criticisms are completely unfounded; but you should first address them, understand them, reexamine your earlier logic and conclusions for things you might have overlooked, and then emerge with a better and deeper understanding, even if your conclusions have not been altered.<br><br><a href=#c78673543467484 title="comment permalink">6/20/10, 6:48 PM</a><br><br>

Of course permaculture is a thing. You've even stated what kind of thing it is: a design system. It can therefore be compared with other design systems, some of which will be more useful for specific applications than it is. No design system is universally applicable to all problems, and anyone who claims that their design system is universally applicable demonstrates, by that claim, that they don't actually understand the design system they're promoting; you don't actually know how to use something until you can name three worthwhile things that it can't do.<br><br>To use one of your metaphors, if you will, soil is not just dirt, but it's not the same thing as air or sea water, either; anyone who claims to know something about soil ought to be able to explain where it begins and ends, and why it's not a suitable medium for birds to fly through or fish to swim in. <br><br>Tom, that's an interesting bit of self-definition -- "more like a party than a protest movement." It seems to me that neither of those is a particularly apt model for what's needed just now. Still, I'll be talking more about this in a later post. <br><br>Bill, that's a valid point -- whatever else permaculture is, it's a human social phenomenon with its own rituals, charismatic figures, nascent institutions, and the like. Still, I'm intrigued by this claim that it can't be defined or critiqued. I know of only one other recent social phenomenon that made that claim, the Seventies and Eighties human potential groups such as EST. It's an unsettling parallel.<br><br><a href=#c5843987598321994628 title="comment permalink">6/20/10, 8:20 PM</a><br><br>

I'm seeing it differently on the ground here -- as Dwig says, it's local differences. In fact what it depends on is who leads in the particular area. I hear more and more discouraging signs about US TT and this experience of Bill's is one of the worst I've heard yet.<br><br>Many people get their first taste of magic through the lighter end of Wicca, or indeed through <i>Buffy</i> -- doesn't mean they stay there. It operates as a gateway for many into real work. Transition is doing the same thing, but unfortunately not everywhere. Personally I can't stand actual TT meetings, but I'm seeing people who are growing food in a number of very ingenious ways, selling it, building community, learning skills, draught-proofing, solar-hot-water-ing, etc. It just can't be got round -- something is happening. And TT is much closer to real decline than <i>Buffy</i> is to real magic.<br><br>I have always said (and rarely got a good reaction) in TT that it is playing a very dangerous game rhetorically. Hopkins' plan seems to be to state the 'future is bright' thing in order to ease people's way in, but at the same time to lower people's expectations as to what that future will actually be <i>materially</i> in a way that (when the statements are placed alongside one another) is actually profoundly contradictory. <br><br>Nevertheless, TT is actually far too mulchy for the truly 'bright green future' types; that's why someone like Alex Steffen is always so against TT, and someone like Sharon Astyk so in favour -- with all-important reservations.<br><br>I could never get a straight answer on this from the movement, but I think the plan has always been to get people engaged and then up the truth factor -- something I am seeing happen. Stoneleigh (of <a href=http://theautomaticearth.blogspot.com/ rel=nofollow>Automatic Earth</a> fame) who is <i>extremely</i> tough-minded recently spoke at TT and did not hold back on her fears about the cosmetic side of the movement triumphing; she was very well-received by those who are really committed, and scared the willies out of those who weren't, which is just what was necessary. But the point is, they were in the room to hear.<br><br>I don't give a stuff about Permaculture, which no TT I know is pursuing very strongly, and I don't follow any TT person like a guru! I'm not in any way left wing and I've never been involved with the Green movement. I also have a burgeoning reputation in TT for being difficult and unwilling to "do the hobbit thing" as I call it.

I've met people from dozens of Transition groups and they are overwhelmingly local. And all the groups I have encountered make it a priority to reach out to existing alternative communities. Many Transitioners remain active in both camps. <br><br>JMG, the same goes for the many permaculture practitioners I have met. I won't contest that you have met 'evasive' individuals who sail under the permaculture banner. But I've met some pretty deranged types sailing under the Druidry banner, too - but that does cause me to disrespect the movement they follow. Quite the opposite. <br><br>Permaculture, we could perhaps agree, is a special case. The word has become associated in the popular imagination with no-till agriculture - or, as someone said here earlier, 'organics with added BS'.<br><br>But the 'permaculture' that Transition-types (if we must be labelled thus) advocate is a broader set of design principles. As articulated by by Holmgren in the link below, permaculture is not a quick fix to the food system - still less a monolithic design system. It's a practical-ethical framework that I'm sure would probably speak to many of your readers here. <br>http://www.holmgren.com.au/html/Writings/essence.html#principals<br><br><a href=#c155641045554039990 title="comment permalink">6/21/10, 6:58 AM</a><br><br>

I don't doubt that there will be movements using magic to try to overreach the US or another industrial military apparatus that will fail because of fuel shortages.

In a nutshell, the idea is to mimic the structures and dynamics of a natural ecosystem. There seems to be importance attached to paying attention to vertical structure as well - i.e., tree crops (nuts and fruits), with perhaps fruit-bearing vines going up, shrubs and small fruits below, right on down to your annual veggies and whatnot, so that you're stacking production and harvesting as much sunlight as possible. Corollary to the tree and small fruits idea is the value of perennial plants.<br><br>Of course, this requires attention to how the sun moves on a particular piece of ground, and a great deal of knowledge of appropriate plant species, water availability, etc. Sort of like what I call "gardening".<br><br>I share the opinion of someone above who mentioned that the founders of the Permaculture brand were very much designing for their place, which is Australia. Water is an issue for those folks. In New Hampshire (where I live), YMMV. Of course, the principles are sound, I guess.<br><br>What some people seem to be turned off by (I tend to be) is the zeal with which Permaculture (TM) seems to want to be monetized. It almost seems that you take the workshops in order to be certified to give a workshop. The workshops are not cheap. Amway, anyone?<br><br>So here in NH, I have apple trees and peach trees and blueberries and raspberries, pasture with sheep and chickens running about, and veggie gardens. Sort of like it's been done for centuries, but None Dare Call It Permaculture ;-) In my opinion, the most useful thing you can do as a gardener is talk to other long-time gardeners in your area to find out what the potential issues are, and what works. And if you're in New England, get books by Elliot Coleman for some great ideas of things to try for season extension.<br><br><a href=#c1490417507094778652 title="comment permalink">6/21/10, 1:19 PM</a><br><br>

Also, the "how" is pretty thin there -- there's a wide variety of mathematical models. (Turing machines, anyone?)

My observation that our local TT/FP community draws from all over the country was not a complaint. It was presented as evidence that the Financial permaculture philosophy of our group here appears to have widespread appeal. What I described as not being a local aberration was the instigator of financial permaculture, a former high Republican muckity-muck in Washington. As I used the pronoun "her," I'm not sure how you felt it was appropriate to replace it with the indefinite "that" and ascribe it to something else entirely. Rereading my comment I'm not sure at all where you came up with your interpretation of what I said. Sure, I may be picking nits over a small rhetorical matter, but you kind of rearranged my words to attribute statements and sentiments to me that I never actually expressed. <br><br>Permaculture: Since many people seem to be wanting a clear definition of it, I'll give a stab at it. My understanding of it is, simply put, that permaculture is:<br><br>The design of human agricultural systems using principles that are informed by and patterned after the functional organization of natural ecosystems. <br><br>That is not a direct quote from anyone, but it is what I interpreted from the original Mollison/Holmgren works. Having spent the first half of my adult life studying the functional organization of natural ecosystems, the intentions and value of this approach were immediately clear to me. Conceptually it has great appeal to many ecologists. <br><br>My complaints with it are in the implementation and attitudes of the implementors, many of whom seem to know far more about the "Permaculture Design Manual" than they do about the actual functional organization of the real ecosystems they are supposed to be learning from. I am also offended by the money and licensing aspects of it, which smack of a pyramid scheme. And it disturbs me that they subsume many other existing systems under their banner (like french intensive, traditional intercropping, square-foot, layer mulching, etc. etc. etc.) and at times seem to present these well-established ideas as though they invented them. Where I come from, we call this plagiarism. And finally, there are the overreaching save-the-world we-can-fix-everything grow-all-the-food-we-need-and-never-lift-a-finger claims, but it shares that sort of problem with many movements. <br><br>Looking at that permaculture definition, it occurs to me that the only real meaningful implementation of "financial permaculture" I can envision is one where you tie your currency to the fundamental currency of nature, which is energy. H.T. Odum was a big advocate of this (a fixed dollar-to-joule standard); however it seems to have little relation to what the financial permaculturists are really talking about.<br><br><a href=#c5857760489654262519 title="comment permalink">6/21/10, 1:58 PM</a><br><br>

Why? Because here in the U.S. the structures of community are weak in most places and an important muscle to exercise for most people is how to operate as a community member. Without community, I think a person's prosperity and sense of fulfillment will be much lower than it need otherwise be.<br><br>Much of the commentary here about TT seems lacking in actual experience in organizing around this topic. (If this is an incorrect assumption, I apologize in advance.) Let me offer the experience of someone who worked as an organizer around peak oil in his community to help shed some light on the practical difficulties involved with that.<br><br>I helped found the Post Carbon group here in Marin and learned many valuable lessons.<br><br>Here is the most important one, and I ask everyone still reading to give it a fair ponder before responding:<br><br><b>The Big Lesson</b><br>Talk about the reality of the end of abundance and of the 20 people at your meeting <i>only one</i> will return to the next meeting.<br><br>This is just what is so and no amount of complaining that humans should be some other way than they actually are is going to change it.<br><br>This wasn't just my experience. I was on the co-ordinators' hub of the Post Carbon program and this seemed to be the universal experience of every organizer there (over 200 at the time).<br><br>I'm more of an analytical type and wanted to tell people "what's really going to happen" so that they could prepare. I figured they were adults and if I could handle it so could they. Thus, the meetings followed the tone that I set. It didn't work. We were unable to drum up interest and get people in action. We were told repeatedly that our meetings were "too depressing."<br><br>So, when all is said and done, TT is at least working to whatever extent it is working. Is it perfect? Not even close. However, it is managing to educate many people who otherwise wouldn't have heard of our predicament.<br><br>I know the pull for us cerebral types is to lay it all out there and let people deal with it. It's just that that approach doesn't work for more than a few people. They are going to tend to have our personality type (eggheads who are voracious readers).<br><br>I happen to converse with the Transition U.S. leadership relatively frequently and am happy to report that their eyes are wide open. It isn't a mistake that Nicole spoke at the conference (Stoneleigh). I have made recommendations and have always felt like my input was valued. The leadership seems very willing to adjust as they go. For instance, they are aware that the current touchy-feely structure of the meetings works in only a few places — certainly not Texas or an inner city. But a start must be made somewhere and people are actively conversing on how to adapt the current methodology to other situations.<br><br>Also, be aware that TT does include their cheerful disclaimer at public events and on various places on their website. You can read it <a href=http://www.transitionus.org/initiatives/cheerful-disclaimer rel=nofollow>here</a>. <br><br>I invite Bill and JMG to consider that people are conscious of your concerns and actually share them. But because their goal is for TT to be highly decentralized, it's not as though they can prevent particular groups from doing what humans everywhere and everytime have done: they will calcify their organizational structures and possibly create in-groups and out-groups. Placing that at the feet of the central organizing group seems unfair to me. With decentralization comes fairly predicable human behaviors and, well, that's just how we seem to work. (Besides, the conversation Bill mentioned above in which some TT'ers were discussing what to say publicly is perfectly fine in my book. It's necessary to understand the limits of what a local community can hear and otherwise there is a real danger of marginalization.) <br><br>cont'd...<br><br><a href=#c3487689366918488239 title="comment permalink">6/21/10, 6:42 PM</a><br><br>

My take is that it's a big mistake to try to force the growth of a mass movement, which as I see it is what the TT movement is trying to do; the more useful option, it seems to me, is to tell it as it is, and let any manifestation of those ideas in the form of action take shape on its own terms, in an organic way.

But that's my take, not any kind of revealed truth. <br><br>I'm a bit startled, though, that you seem to think I blame the core organizing group for what TT seems likely to be in the process of becoming. Quite the contrary, one of the things that characterizes mass movements of this kind is that they usually get out of the hands of the people who start them. Whose hands they end up in, if any, can have a huge -- and often disastrous -- impact on the way the movement develops. If TT turns into a full-scale revitalization movement, or if it gets coopted by a political movement with a charismatic leader, or if it falls victim to any of the other common traps of mass movements, I'm sure Rob Hopkins et al. will be horrified -- though in any of those cases he'll have been eased out of any position of active influence long before. <br><br>But I'll be going into this in much more detail in the next <i>Archdruid Report</i> post.<br><br><a href=#c5339460768452546231 title="comment permalink">6/21/10, 7:48 PM</a><br><br>

But, I would like to mention a couple things that I think may be overlooked in this discussion on permaculture and its relevance to human-ecological systems.<br><br>First, I would like to comment on what you stated in your last post--which is as follows:<br><br>You take a stab at defining permaculture with the following:<br><br>"The design of human agricultural systems using principles that are informed by and patterned after the functional organization of natural ecosystems."<br><br>In my limited understanding of all of the principles and concepts of permaculture design, I would state that the "concepts" of permaculture are deeply rooted in Systems Ecology as determined by Odum et. al. Holmgren and many others make reference to this as being its origins and utilize "systems" concepts to make permaculture design of use in many of the varied ecological systems presently underway on our earth. Therefore, it is not just "human agriculutral systems" with which this design interface can be applied--assuming that whole systems behave in the manner with which Systems Ecologists (utilizing thermodynamic energy flows) have described with sources, sinks, feedback loops, etc. With this premise, permaculture principles, methods, etc. could be applied to "any" human-ecological function vis a vis so-called sustainable human communities. Whereby, incorporating more than just an "agricultural" emphasis. <br><br>My understanding is that permaculture's origin is also rooted in applied environmental design--which began with home-scale systems and has since expanded to include entire ecological regions. A good reference to link the two is the text "A Patterned Language" by Christopher Alexander et. al.<br><br>You follow by stating: <br><br>"That is not a direct quote from anyone, but it is what I interpreted from the original Mollison/Holmgren works. Having spent the first half of my adult life studying the functional organization of natural ecosystems, the intentions and value of this approach were immediately clear to me. Conceptually it has great appeal to many ecologists."<br><br>I could not agree more. Ecologists and Permaculturists should be working closely together to mitigate the challenges we face with respect to biophysical limits and the like to bridge the gap between human culture and natural ecosystems such that we may begin to build (at least to some extent) resilient human communities working symbiotically with natural ecosystems. If we can accomplish this, we could begin to stop seeing the two as separated by function but unified with a single purpose--further validating that humans are not removed or distinct from natural ecosystems and vice versa. <br><br>Just my two cents, but I think this is what permaculture is intended to do--a method or way through the difficult times ahead.<br><br><a href=#c1899478317589473983 title="comment permalink">6/22/10, 8:01 AM</a><br><br>

Of course there are examples of attempts to move a group that failed.<br><br>But there are countless examples of communities aligning on a direction and moving as a group in which the move began with an idea in the mind of a single person who said to themself, "I want my community to do <i>this</i>.

I don't hate meetings and talk, but I much prefer accomplishing useful things.<br><br>However, I think what happened to the term "Permaculture" is a shame. It's happened to Christianity and other religions, I guess... the original ideas are one thing but the uses later made of it by perhaps misguided followers, quite another. However anyone jeers, the principles of permaculture are incredibly useful in thinking about the problems on the homestead and I'll continue to use and apply them. While in no way embracing the herb spiral or the forest garden, and liking my vegetables growing in neat rows.<br><br>And there's one other sad lesson I learned. When you have something great, it doesn't help ease the pain of losing it, by being aware of the fact you are going to lose it. We had a lovely peaceful home, knowing someone was going to build next door some day, and I savored every moment, thinking it would help.

In our subsistence days, England (leaving aside somewhat different Scotland, Wales, Ireland) historically had a peak 'carrying capacity' of ~5.7M, or a touch over 10% of today's population. Organic farming after 1750 increasingly used biological fixation of N (soil nitrogen from clover) and dramatically raised the ceiling until by 1850 about 22% of the population just about fed the rest of the by then mostly urban 16.6M. Quite a bit of the ground of course had to feed the horses. Later, we mostly imported food. We probably could do better now if we could still get synthetic fertilizer inputs, and lived mostly as vegetarians. Urban 'victory gardens' in WWI &amp; WWII certainly helped but were small stuff even in those desperate situations. <br>I think Transition and Permaculture have worth, but if they get serious will need much much more than DIY self-help food production, especially here in the UK. The potential food situation will be different in the USA, even if as Stoneigh rightly describes, we all are chained to the same economic wheel. My guess is that in the UK we must look to very large scale collective arrangements, (as during WWII), and that real 'self-reliance' could be more of a US thing.<br><br><a href=#c383942206081237173 title="comment permalink">6/22/10, 1:22 PM</a><br><br>

The ones we perceive as leaders are the ones that caught good waves. I always think of Ronald Reagan (perhaps a dated example for many of you). In 1976 as a presidential candidate he was a joke, on the fringe. In 1980 he was elected president. He did not change; the cultural waves in America did. Sometimes it might seem like someone mobilized a community to action all by him- or herself; but I believe that is only because they resonated with a spark, with a nascent wave that was primed and ready to go. A thousand other people failed to catch a wave, we just don't know about them. <br><br>This is not to denigrate the role leaders and organizers take; they can have a major role in shaping the way these waves manifest. But they (you) do not create them, and it is hubris to believe that you do. <br><br>And all the suggestions that those who disagree with you should self-censor (i.e. shut the hell up) will not change this. You can fight the tide until you are blue in the face, but it still will not yield to your insistence that it is flowing the wrong way.<br><br><a href=#c7970433017917648062 title="comment permalink">6/22/10, 5:17 PM</a><br><br>

If they make things more difficult for what you're trying to do, well, that's unfortunate, but furthering your projects comes well down my list of priorities, you know. Mind you, if your project requires the agreement of most of the people in the peak oil scene, it's already doomed, so you may want to reconsider your own ideas on the subject. <br><br>Lisa, that's a valuable lesson, though I know it's not an easy or a pleasant one. <br><br>Wolf, nicely put. <br><br>Phil, thanks for the details. I've come to think that the World War II experience on both sides of the Atlantic offers some important lessons; I have a cookbook of wartime recipes published by the Imperial War Museum, for example, and a lot of the attitudes and habits practiced in Britain during its siege by U-boat seem likely to be very relevant in the future. <br><br>Bill, I hope it doesn't amount to that.<br><br>Mageprof, funny you should mention your studies in this context.

It seems that many of the posters here would rather us types who would like to move our individual communities toward some sort of collective action just give up before we start since their experience and knowledge clearly demonstrates that either it can't be done or it is a worthless endeavor. So be it. As people are free to ignore me I'm of course free to ignore them (I'll be sure to stay clear of mageprof for instance).<br><br>JMG, my goals are rather limited in scope. I'm under no illusion that we will move great swaths of humanity to a sustainable state before our numbers (i.e. population) are quite a bit lower than now. And my goals do not *need* any one person's agreement. They need some sort of tipping point within a community to be sure and that can happen all sorts of ways. <br><br>But in the meantime, I will keep standing for local organizers to pick attainable goals that they rally their community around (maybe even a stretch goal or two, since those are more fun to work toward). Not all groups turn into the types warned of here.<br><br><a href=#c4194877155180935479 title="comment permalink">6/22/10, 10:20 PM</a><br><br>

I guess in this context of discussing magical thinking it might be best to send us off to the pyre, as usual, before we say too much. <br><br>Godel had a long and productive life (72 years) and you can understand something of his paranoia towards the end given his experiences of Europe of WWI and the 20s and 30s (and the US to 1978?). Incidentally, at his US citizenship ceremony, he tried to point out the flaw in the US Constitution that would allow for a dictatorship to be established legally. Maybe that might make him a prophet at some point? In his own way he did something most valuable, made the 1900 project of Hilbert, a totally logical formlation of all mathematics and all possible mathematics, a permanent impossibility. You could say he was a pioneer of the business of muddling through - and proved we couldn't ever with integrity do anything else, even in mathematics.<br><br>Still, Wordek, I do appreciate the hexadecimal, a much more sensitive presentation of our condition.<br><br><a href=#c2247530958609658459 title="comment permalink">6/23/10, 12:28 AM</a><br><br>

I guess familarity with exponential functions has disposed me to a sensitivity to the core reality underlying your awareness of our civilisation's condition. I was an early adopter and teacher of the then somewhat new then Dynamic Systems Theory (Chaos Theory) way back when, and the feedback systems whose behaviours are explored there, that are also a major component of your analysis. More power to your arm. <br><br>A lot of people I know have been talking about these issues now for a considerable number of years, among them geologists, foresters, geneticists, biologists and mathematicians. There is a lot more going on in their under-the-radar actions than most would register as relating to the limits to growth. If my experience here in my limited social network here in Oz is generalisable, there may be more being put on and in the ground than one would expect from what is on the net or in mainstream media. It's just not visible yet to those who can't see it for what it is. That may be a small hope, but maybe it will relieve the sense that comes across here at times that there are only a select few who see what is on the screen. There are perhaps plenty who do, and who are acting in interesting ways, but not in a public manner.<br><br><a href=#c6255989358218426592 title="comment permalink">6/23/10, 12:57 AM</a><br><br>

If someone is completely unacquainted with the concept of decline, then no amount of arm waving or earnest conversation will convince them of its presence.

You should listen twice as much as you talk." In this day and age it makes clear sense. We as human-beings are spiritual and place our confidence into what we consider a higher power. The true magic of that would be that the so called higher power could be a man or woman who will be embraced as an icon or leader. Sure, we all would love to see the world turn in the right direction, but who are we to judge what direction is the right direction? We second guess ourselves and as a result appoint our leaders to make choices for us that do not usually benefit us. People crave a revolution of sorts, but why complain? Why question? There is a leader in us all and we are all clearly capable of change on all realms of our own humanity. Rather than question the stance of human sustainability, one should look inward and consider his/her own sustainability. Well, I listened to everybody, had my chance to talk. Thank you, it was a pleasure. By the way, Mr. Greer, I appreciate your books/blogs very much.
