Perhaps the most interesting responses to the discussion of mass movements here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i> have been those that insisted that the only alternative, either to a mass movement in the abstract or to some specific movement, was defeat and despair. That’s an odd sort of logic, since mass movements are hardly the only tool in the drawer; I suspect that part of what drives the insistence is the herd-mindedness of our species – we are, after all, social mammals with most of the same inborn habits of collective behavior you’ll find in any of the less solitary vertebrates.<br><br>Still, the pressure toward some such movement has another potent force driving it: the awkward fact that the vast majority of people today simply do not want to hear how difficult their future is going to be. It doesn’t matter how good your evidence is or how well you make your case, most of your listeners will simply look uncomfortable and change the subject. Why this should be the case is an interesting question; I suspect that much of the blame lies with the cult of positive thinking Barbara Ehrenreich anatomized in <a href=http://www.barbaraehrenreich.com/brightsided.htm>a recent book</a>, though I’m quite willing to hear alternative explanations. <br><br>Still, for whatever reason, an extraordinary blindness to the downside has become crazy-glued in place straight across contemporary culture. From economists who insist that the bubble du jour (right now, in case you haven’t noticed, it’s government debt) can keep on inflating forever, through technology fans who believe devoutly that their favorite piece of drawing-board vaporware will necessarily solve the world’s problems without side effects and with spare change left over, to millions of ordinary people who can’t or won’t imagine a future without the material abundance of recent decades, we seem to have lost the collective capacity to recognize that things can and do go very, very wrong. It’s not merely a matter of blindness to the “black swan” events Nassim Nicholas Taleb made famous, either; we’re just as bad at seeing white swans coming, even when they’ve been predicted for decades and the sky is so thick with them that it’s hard to see anything else.<br><br>It’s an appalling predicament: how can a community prepare for a troubled future if most people tune out even the slightest suggestion that it might be troubled? It’s for this reason, seemingly, that many people in the peak oil scene have chosen to downplay the difficulties and insist that we can have a bright, happy, abundant future if we just pursue whatever baby steps toward sustainability we all find congenial. I’ve been assured by some of the people making such claims that they’re perfectly aware that the situation is far more difficult and dangerous than that, but that the need to get as people involved in some kind of movement toward sustainability is so great, they say, that waffling on that point is as justified as it is necessary.<br><br>As it happens, I think they’re making a hideous mistake. I’ve discussed the reasons for that perception at length in several recent posts, and won’t rehash them here. The question that remains is whether there are any viable alternatives, and that’s the question I want to address in today’s post. To explain the option I have in mind, though, it may be useful to borrow a metaphor from history.<br><br>I don’t know how many of my readers know this, but my most recent publication is a translation of a <a href=http://www.renaissanceastrology.com/astrologyandmagicbooks.html#completepicatrix>very strange book</a> from the Middle Ages. Its title is <i>Picatrix</i>, and it is one of the sole surviving examples of that absolute rarity of medieval literature, a textbook for apprentice wizards. Those of my readers who grew up on stories about Merlin, Gandalf et al. take note: those characters, legendary or fictional as they are, were modeled on an actual profession that flourished in the early Middle Ages, and remained relatively active until the bottom fell out of the market at the end of the Renaissance.<br><br>By "wizard" here I don’t mean your common or garden variety fortune teller or ritual practitioner; we have those in abundance today. The wizard of the early Middle Ages in Europe and the Muslim world, rather, was a freelance intellectual whose main stock in trade was good advice, though admittedly that came well frosted with incantation and prophecy as needed. He had a good working knowledge of astrology, which filled roughly the same role in medieval thought that theoretical physics does today, and an equally solid knowledge of ritual magic, but his training did not begin or end there. According to <i>Picatrix</i>, the compleat wizard in training needed to get a thorough education in agriculture; navigation; political science; military science; grammar, languages, and rhetoric; commerce, all the mathematics known at the time, including arithmetic, geometry, music theory, and astronomy; logic; medicine, including a good knowledge of herbal pharmaceuticals; the natural sciences, including meteorology, mineralogy, botany, and zoology; and Aristotle’s metaphysics: in effect, the sum total of the scientific learning that had survived from the classical world.<br><br>Now it may have occurred to my readers that this doesn’t sound like the sort of education you’d get at Hogwarts, and that’s exactly the point. Whether you believe that the movements of the planets foretell events on Earth, as almost everyone did in the Middle Ages, or whether you think astrology is simply a clever anticipation of game theory that gets its results by inserting random factors into strategic decisions to make them unpredictable, you’ll likely recognize that a soothsayer with the sort of background I’ve just sketched out would be well prepared to offer sound advice on most of the questions that might perplex a medieval peasant, merchant, baron or king. Nor, of course, would someone so trained be restricted in his choice of active measures to incantations alone. This is arguably why so many medieval kings and barons had professional sorcerers and soothsayers on staff, despite the fulminations of all the dominant religions of the age, and why wizards less adept at social climbing found a bumper crop of customers lower down the social ladder.<br><br>The origins of this profession are, if anything, even more interesting. Pierre Riché’s useful study <i>Education and Culture in the Barbarian West</i> showed in detail how the educational institutions of the late Roman world imploded as their economic and social support systems crumpled beneath them. In Europe – matters were a little more complex in the Muslim world – they were replaced by a monastic system of education that, in its early days, fixated almost entirely on scriptural and theological studies, and by methods of training young aristocrats that fixated even more tightly on the skills of warfare and government. Only among families with a tradition of classical letters did some semblance of the old curriculum stay in use, and Riché notes that while that custom continued, those who learned philosophy, one of the core studies in that curriculum, were widely suspected of dabbling in magic. It’s not too hard to connect the dots and see how a subculture of freelance intellectuals, equipped with unusual knowledge and a willingness to stray well outside the boundaries set by the culture of their time, would have emerged from that context.<br><br>All this may seem worlds away from the issues raised earlier in this essay, but there’s a direct connection. The wizards of the early Middle Ages were individuals who recognized the value of certain branches of knowledge and certain attitudes toward the world that were profoundly unpopular in their time, and took it on themselves to preserve the knowledge, cultivate the attitudes, and make connections with those who shared the same sense of values,or at least were interested in making practical use of the skills that the knowledge and attitides made possible. There was no mass movement to support the survival of classical science in the sixth and seventh centuries CE, and no hope of starting one; the mass movements of the time – when they weren’t simply stampeding mobs trying to get out of the way of the latest round of barbarian invasions – embraced the opposite opinion. How much of a role wizards might have played in the transmission of classical learning to the future is anyone’s guess, since records of their activities are very sparse, but it’s clear that they were an intellectual resource much used during an age when few other resources of the kind were available.<br><br>I’ve come to think that a strategy of the same kind, if a bit more tightly focused, might well be one of the best options just now for an age when very few people are willing to make meaningful preparations for a difficult future. Certain branches of practical knowledge, thoroughly learned and just as thoroughly practiced by a relatively modest number of people, could be deployed in a hurry to help mitigate the impact of the energy shortages, economic dislocations, and systems breakdowns that are tolerably certain to punctuate the years ahead of us. I’m sure my readers have their own ideas about the kind of knowledge that might be best suited to that context, but I have a particular suggestion to offer: the legacy of the apppropriate technology movement of the 1970s.<br><br>This was not simply a precursor of today’s sustainability projects, and the differences are important. The appropriate tech movement, with some exceptions, tended to avoid the kind of high-cost, high-profile eco-chic projects so common today. Much of it focused instead on simple technologies that could be put to work by ordinary people without six-figure incomes, doing the work themselves, using ordinary tools and readily available resources. Most of these technologies were evolved by basement-shop craftspeople and small nonprofits working on shoestring budgets, and ruthlessly field-tested by thousands of people who built their own versions in their backyards and wrote about the results in the letters column of <i>Mother Earth News</i>. <br><br>The resulting toolkit was a remarkably well integrated, effective, and cost-effective set of approaches that individuals, families, and communities could use to sharply reduce their dependence on fossil fuels and the industrial system in general. It was not, I should probably point out, particularly esthetic, unless you happen to like a lively fusion of down home funk, late twentieth century garage-workshop, and hand-dyed back-to-the-land hippie paisley; those of my readers who own houses and are still fretting about their resale value (and haven’t yet figured out that this figure will be denominated in imaginary numbers for the next several decades at least) will likely run screaming from it; those who were incautious enough to buy homes in suburban developments with restrictive covenants will have to step carefully, at least until their neighbors panic. Apartment dwellers will have to pick and choose a bit; on the other hand, those of my readers who will spend time living in tarpaper shacks before the Great Recession ends – and I suspect a fair number of people will have that experience, as a fair number of people did the last time the economy lost touch with reality and imploded the way it’s currently doing – will find that very nearly everything the appropriate tech people did will be well within their reach.<br><br>What’s included in the package I’m discussing? Intensive organic gardening, for starters, with its support technologies of composting, green manure, season extenders, and low-tech food preservation and storage methods; small-scale chicken and rabbit raising, and home aquaculture of fish; simple attached solar greenhouses, which make the transition from food to energy by providing heat for homes as well as food for the table; other retrofitted passive solar heating technologies; solar water heating; a baker’s dozen or more methods for conserving hot or cool air with little or no energy input; and a good deal more. None of it will save the world, if that hackneyed phrase means maintaining business as usual on some supposedly sustainable basis; what it can do is make human life in a world suffering from serious energy shortages and economic troubles a good deal less traumatic and more livable.<br><br>This is the suite of technologies I studied as a budding appropriate-tech geek during the late 1970s and 1980s, and it was central to the training program that earned me my Master Conserver certificate in 1985. One teaches what one knows, and I’m going to take the gamble of devoting much of the next year or so of <i>Archdruid Report</i> posts to the details. My hope is that I can encourage at least a few of my readers to follow the very old example mentioned earlier, and become the green wizards of the decades ahead of us.<br><br>For that, I have come to think, is one of the things the soon-to-be-deindustrializing world most needs just now: green wizards. By this I mean individuals who are willing to take on the responsibility to learn, practice, and thoroughly master a set of unpopular but valuable skills – the skills of the old appropriate tech movement – and share them with their neighbors when the day comes that their neighbors are willing to learn. This is not a subject where armchair theorizing counts for much – as every wizard’s apprentice learns sooner rather than later, what you really know is measured by what you’ve actually done – and it’s probably not going to earn anyone a living any time soon, either, though it can help almost anyone make whatever living they earn go a great deal further than it might otherwise go. Nor, again, will it prevent the unraveling of the industrial age and the coming of a harsh new world; what it can do, if enough people seize the opportunity, is make the rough road to that new world more bearable than it will otherwise be.<br><br>I also propose to have a certain amount of fun with the wizard archetype in the posts to come. Still, that’s an example of what the Renaissance alchemist Michael Maier called a <i>lusus serius</i>, a game played in earnest, a dead serious joke. The present time, as I’ve suggested here more than once, has plenty of features in common with the twilight years of classical civilization, the age that gave rise to the legends of Merlin and Arthur, and made it in retrospect a poetic necessity for the greatest of all legendary kings to be advised by the greatest of all legendary wizards.<br><br>Thus there’s a certain lively irony in the fact that, back in the days when I was sanding blades for a homebuilt wind turbine and studying the laws of thermodynamics in Master Conserver classes in the meeting room of the old Seattle Public library, one of my favorite bits of music was Al Stewart’s <i>Merlin’s Time</i>:<br><br><i>Who would walk the stony roads of Merlin’s time,<br>And keep the watch along the borderline?<br>And who would hear the legends passed in song and rhyme<br>Upon the shepherd pipes of Merlin’s time?</i><br><br>In its own way, that’s the question that upcoming posts will pose to my readers; we’ll see what the answer turns out to be.

The hands-on training is the easy part -- I'll cover how that works a bit further down the road. <br><br>Librarian, good. Excellent, in fact.

Is there an Ap for that?<br><br>On thing about all those practical, functional, straightforward technologies is that they really just get right to the heart of the matter bypassing ideology and politics. You don't need to shift someone's worldview or their consciousness; you just show them something they can afford and do for themselves that WORKS. My neighbor and I who probably disagree on just about everything that might be mentioned on Faux News have no trouble at all having civil and mutually informative discussions when it comes to chickens, ponds, and tomato plants. I first learned about ram pumps not from the Permacultire Design Institute but from the Church-of-Christ-attending local fundamentalists. <br><br>One thing about hippies in the rural south... in the 1970s the lines between hippy and redneck got very blurry down here among the young adult generation. Everyone had long hair and wore the same blue jeans, all the men had the same scruffy beards, and everyone listened to the same Southern Rock and smoked the same dope. The back-to-the-landers and the hillbillies were living similar lives, side by side. Corn was corn, beans were beans, a barn was a barn, and something that helped you stay warm and stay fed on little money worked just the same whether your tank top said Lynyrd Skynyrd, Grateful Dead, Merle, or Waylan. <br><br>When it comes down to the nut cuttin' it's about results here and now on the scale of the individual household.

He's actually quite opposite me politically, but he brought up an interesting news item. Apparently, the US government has loaned money to Brazil's oil company Petrobras (as has China's govt) to help Brazil get at the oil in the Tupi oil field.<br><br>My friend brought this up in the typical conspiracy theory style, as a ploy for Obama to inflate the value of George Soros' funds (he is VERY heavily invested in Petrobras). He suggested this was corruption that could be the wedge for impeachment. I pointed out to him that it was more likely spent to get an American stake in Brazil's oil, in a time where oil is kinda important. He didn't seem to even consider it. I suggested that perhaps we were running into energy issues, and he said, "they've been saying that for 30 years and nothing's happened"...<br><br>I don't know whether it's due to a policy of silence or active propaganda, but energy issues are the ultimate invisible white swan/elephant in the living room/etc.<br><br>I'm really looking forward to your posts on mitigation strategies. I've actually been thinking about it, and it strikes me that we will see some very odd things in the future. I used to live on Oahu, and ironically I think Hawaii has an opportunity to come out much better off than many other places. Right now it depends on oil, but it also is incredibly fertile and has a strong communities of organic, local, and traditional agriculture. At the time the West found their way to Hawaii, the main isles supported a very large population through an extremely well organized system of agriculture. The regional divisions, ahupua'a, stretched from the mountains to the sea, providing a balance of resources to the community. On the other hand, Hawaii is very dependent on oil right now and many people see it as being hopelessly overpopulated and unsustainable (which it is, in the sense that if something happened suddenly it would be in real trouble, and the bulk of the population is on Oahu). If the descent proves as long as you foresee, though, I could see Hawaii coming out very well (though not without serious bumps).<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c3640787996375950745 title="comment permalink">6/30/10, 10:27 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avtb a_71d96f" id=c8805268019102946638></div><b><a href=https://draft.blogger.com/profile/03097443949826910958 rel=nofollow>Avery</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>John, I finished your "Ecotechnic Future" earlier today, and as I was in a library, I picked up a copy of Spengler's "Decline of the West" which I had never gotten around to finishing before. One thing that struck me about Spengler is his insistence that a culture needs a driving force to further its inner development: a far-off goal which necessitates a capture of resources and increase of population, and makes the culture a notable actor on the planet. (His maxim that a civilization is a culture which has completed its mission and has nowhere to go rings true as well.) It seems to me that the real survival of important knowledge in a post-collapse society requires the drive of a culture and not a few lone wizards. In fact, without a culture that believes in their abilities, the work of those who conserve ecological knowledge will be in vain. ("Dad, are you wasting your time on that rainwater collection project again?") Rather, the wizards must have an emotional, meaningful message for society, explaining what they are working for and how it will be accomplished.<br><br>I was so captivated by that idea that I started writing a little story about it, but I don't have the power of foresight that you display so clearly in "Ecotechnic Future", so I would ask as you make your way through your survival kit to explain why a culture might honor and commit to these techniques.<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c8805268019102946638 title="comment permalink">6/30/10, 10:49 PM</a><br><br>

On the topic of positive thinking I suspect that it is an evolutionary adaptation to help social mammals through bottlenecks. Optimists tend to live longer, healthier lives but pessimists have more accurate worldviews. Optimisms is normally a self-fulfilling prophecy providing health, opportunity, and social status. But occasionally the whole of society is laboring under disastrous misconceptions and needs people capable of accurate assessments.<br><br> Peak oil and the housing/financial crisis come to mind as examples of obvious disconnects between expectations and reality. Contrary to popular belief both were predicted well in advance. From Time magazine: "Since early 2000, economists have been sounding the housing bubble alarm with increasing urgency." and peak oil has been around much longer. But the majority of the population didn't notice.<br><br> Which brings us back to magic. Nassim Taleb and a handful of other spotted the obvious and became revered by society as wizards of finance when the obvious came to pass.<br><br> A few years ago I worked the same magic brooding on my parents back porch 'worrying about the future' I was worried about peak oil and the financial house of cards. I spent the next two years learning a lot about both of them. I started talking to my parents about cashing out their investments in the summer of 2007.<br><br> I used the huge surge in credibility to push for a chicken coop, solar hot water, fruit trees, and investments in the new food co-op. I imagine wizards of old would do much the same thing, forecasting an eclipse and then urging their lords to make peace with the neighbors.<br><br> One last thing, which is off topic, why did Eastern monasteries develop martial arts while the Western monotheistic monasteries did not? Why didn't Catholicism develop a martial art when the Buddhists got Kung Fu?<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c3292211510481113443 title="comment permalink">7/1/10, 12:23 AM</a><br><br>

Juxtapose that with the news that technophobics in China are murdering themselves to escape factories producing these I-pods/macs/phones. <br><br>In the past century we have been driven by the simple factory model of industrialization, which values production over the worker. <br><br>Consider the following: In the U.S. high-level technophobic fears was 29%.

No doubt the cult of quantum miracles discussed by Ehrenreich is a part of the answer. But that doesn't touch the core, I don't think. <br><br>I see two layers holding up the belief in progress. The upper layer, in more direct contact with the belief, is in science and technology. We have the smarts and the tools to solve any problem. Most any engineer will sneer at the "positive thinking" discussed by Ehrenreich, but shockingly many subscribe to the silliness of Kurzweil's singularity. Kurzweil himself is a plenty smart engineer. <br><br>Beneath that is a kind of desparation born from the devastation of 17th Century Europe. David Loy's _Buddhist History of the West_ is really worth reading! Folks like Bacon and Leibniz were really rather desparate, trying to patch together some way to hold society together. We need a foundation or a vessel, a belief system to hold society together. Christianity splintered, so now we have science. We need hope! We have to maintain our faith in science to justify our hope in progress, or society will disintegrate!<br><br>One huge task in front of us is to reassemble this ship as we keep sailing it through rough seas. I see two puzzles: how to re-think science, so it can help us feed ourselves etc. without requiring us to subscribe to myths of material salvation in a heaven of abundance.

You gather it up, use it as best you can, and try your best to send it forward to an unknown future. It won't save the world and it does not have to in order to be of value.<br><br>I like this direction. I've got a lot of practical knowledge from engineering and a country boy's life of building, making, and fixing things, but my knowledge in growing things and the environmental science areas you've studied is still weak. No two people must have identical skills, but it's clear to me I've got important things to learn about.<br><br>I've grown a little bored with picturing the future lately, mainly because things are playing out in a broadly predictable way. I already accepted that (at best) I'll be poor, tired, and lacking for time and resources, but such is life. There are some who have figured it out, but at the most you can only convince a few more percent. It's far more useful now to focus on the practical - those things that one can learn and do - and I'll be grateful for a resource to help expand my skills.<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c5222628740178560256 title="comment permalink">7/1/10, 6:53 AM</a><br><br>

Science, performed correctly, is an unremorseful, unbiased quest for objective physical truth. Key words and phrases are "performed correctly", "unbiased", and "physical truth". Whatever preconceptions people thrust upon it or bring to the table when they perform it have nothing to do with understanding the nature of the world around us.<br><br>It's important to separate the tools (scientific method) from the operator (human being, complete with bias). Once you do that, you can begin to understand that science is the best tool we have to understand physical realities, nothing more or less.<br><br>It's not science that pollutes the environment, it's attitudes toward the environment that allow pollution. It's not science that cause birth defects, it's people that haven't done the research to verify a drug is safe. To blame science for the ills of the world is like blaming hammers for breaking windows.<br><br>I also think that this ties into the idea of popular movements; what is pseudoscience but an attempt by a few charlatains with "special" knowledge to gather followers to their ideology. How about people with special mystical knowledge who reject "science" as evil and they have the One True Way, and you can too if you follow along!<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c1874413010684388807 title="comment permalink">7/1/10, 7:16 AM</a><br><br>

The theme for future posts sounds great. Practical things we can actually do make all the difference. My wife just gave me a copy of John Seymour’s Self-Sufficient Life, which draws heavily from his 70’s writings and is full of great ideas. It reminds me how much closer to that way of living a whole lot more people were just one or two generations ago. So hopefully a good number can come back to terms with a more strenuous way of life. I agree with other comments that calming spiritual practices will be very important, also.<br><br>I’m guessing there are lots of reasons why we resist the inevitable. As a Brit who has lived in the US for a while, I’ve generally admired the positive thinking culture here, at least when I was younger. But positive thinking is only one door down from wishful thinking, and that has been a problem for some time now, possibly forever.<br><br>Making change is hard any time, and this is the mother of all changes – a once in a millennium civilizational wobbly. You have to be made of strong stuff to get out ahead of that. I’ve done easier stuff myself (garden, compost, downshifted job, work from home, thermostats at 60, etc) but it’s still hard to step over that line that declares publically, for all my neighbors and kids to see, that I’m expecting the imminent end of industrial civilization. At least it is hard for me. Getting my kids expectations reset for one thing takes time. Yesterday my daughter wondered if we would always be eating “small, dirty vegetables”. Gotta love that teenage sarcasm. <br><br>So I know I need to go much further, and maybe mounting some low-budget and probably unsightly home energy technology on my front porch is the flag that I need to wave.<br><br>Thanks again.<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c3597727200184924747 title="comment permalink">7/1/10, 8:08 AM</a><br><br>

I am a sort of Hedge Witch myself, I know herbs and how to use them for medicinal purposes...I know that if you trim your fingernails after sundown on Fridays they will be healthier and stronger...trim your hair during the new moon (especially during Leo) and it will grow fast and thick. I learned most of my knowledge of such things from my Irish grandmother. My whole family embraced technology while I was learning to bake bread from scratch, quilt and reading books on composting. My sisters went to college and ended up in careers in real estate and public relations. I ended up having kids and living in a cabin for awhile, lol!<br><br>I have spent my teen and adult life learning skills from the 17th-18th centuries without knowing why I felt compelled to do so. Now, I find people asking me more and more often "How do you do this without power/an engine/modern technology/whatever?"<br>To me, many of these tasks are simple-- I find myself looking at some people and thinking "But they are so SMART! Why couldn't they figure this out on their own?"<br><br>A friend of mine says I fill the role of the "village elder" among our circle of friends. (To which I replied in mild horror: "Dear god, I need to re-touch my roots NOW!!")<br><br>I think my friend has a point, though...not all of us will be *green wizards*. Some of us will be *village elders*, conversant and expert on a few things that will make us assets to our communities, but not expert in the wide range that a *wizard* would be expected to be.<br>I kind of like the idea of having such elders...and the idea of being one is not too scary. An elder you go to for advice and comfort. An elder does not sound quite as powerful as a wizard, but that's okay.<br>I think the first thing all the wanna-be wizards need to do is to hunt down their elder relatives and community members and learn from them the skills they have to pass on.<br>I learned about herbs from my grandmother.<br>I learned to weave cloth (and build a simple loom) from an old lady that lived nearby when I lived in Germany.<br>Seek out those that have something to teach, so that you can pass on knowledge. Even if it is one simple skill, that one skill can prove valuable.<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c8488673040996650969 title="comment permalink">7/1/10, 8:17 AM</a><br><br>

We’re doing everything you describe, and share our bounty with the neighbors, yet there’s still only a hint of commitment of the most token nature, despite the fact that folks in my area are as lefty/crunchy as can be. There’s surface admiration and envy, but always with the caveat that it appears too daunting for them to attempt. I detect a strong suspicion that they see what we’re doing as too much of a sacrifice, when in fact it isn’t, by any means. Sacrifice to me has been turned upside down: on the rare occasions when my wife fails to bake the bread and I am forced to get it from the local bakery, it seems like settling (even though it’s perfectly acceptable artisan loaves made from organic local wheat). We pass out bags of lettuce from the greenhouse or eggs from our chickens since we produce more than we consume, but also as a form of banking social capital as part of digging in and becoming integral to this area. I feel like we’re doing everything we can, and it’s down to refinements and broadening the skill set at this point to build resiliency and security. Overall I am tickled by the progress that’s been made, but how to instill a sense of urgency on the part of those who are receptive to the appropriate tech alternative is my question.<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c1157895354287338336 title="comment permalink">7/1/10, 8:33 AM</a><br><br>

I can see how knowledge not commonly held today will become arcane in the future. I wonder if there is a way to form a network of people who practice low tech solutions to our energy problems (small homemade wind turbines, water pumps and generators), water collection and purification techniques, aquaculture, herbal medicine, etc…. <br>I know that some networks already exist but I wonder if they can be maintained when transportation and long distance communication becomes increasingly more difficult. Or and probably more likely we would pass our knowledge down to children and apprentices who would then with any luck pass their knowledge down to future generations.<br>I wonder if this will replace our current public education system or if some communities might have a school to teach reading writing and arithmetic. Probably both and it depends on the resources and stability of the community. I do think that this would put high values on libraries and hope that the books are copied before they become unreadable.<br>I guess the trouble would come from the fact that people might not realize that knowledge needs to be preserved until it is too late. We are use to have libraries and if we are concentrating more on not starving, or freezing to death we could very well forget about a knowledge base until it is too late.<br>As usual you have given me much to think about.<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c8642674647570818402 title="comment permalink">7/1/10, 9:26 AM</a><br><br>

People who make no attempt to do so are quickly marginalized. Is that "fair?" Of course not. But it is how it is for humans.<br><br>Right now there is a group of people who will respond to your message of appropriate technology. There are many, many more people who won't. How does one start moving them along?<br><br>It's not enough to just keep saying that there is a different way that should be used. People working in the field, like me, are trying to tell you: "It doesn't work for everyone."<br><br>We are going to muddle through this with each personality type attracted to what suits them for where there are at the moment. The Transition movement is moving people along, getting them in action, while educating them along the way. Witness their inclusion of Nicole Foss (Stoneleigh) from the Automatic Earth at the Transition conference in England. She opened many peoples eyes there, apparently. And she talks straight: we are heading into an epic Depression and you had better get ready.<br><br>Another element to consider is that, if I recall correctly, your spouse knows what's coming and is working with you to prepare for that future. Having a spouse who "gets it" colors what you think will work more than you know, I believe.<br><br>Just ask any person in a marriage who has a spouse who can't see what's coming (like mine) and is looking for any way possible to engage them. Your method often does not work for them (I and many, many other spouses have tried) whereas other methods that are currently out there just might. In every course we conduct someone asks, "How do I bring my spouse along? Telling her/him why we need to prepare just isn't working and they are digging their heels in."<br><br>Of course there is certainly no guarantee but if it gets a conversation going about growing a garden or learning to can food that otherwise wouldn't happen — and the alternative is obstinate refusal to do anything — I and many other people will wholeheartedly (perhaps desperately) take what we can get.<br><br>There are many approaches and each will work for different people. Your certainty that at least one approach other than your own is a "hideous mistake" strikes me as, well, uncharacteristically dogmatic of you (that's actually a compliment). Keep doing what you are doing, I'll do what I'm doing and others will do what they are doing. <br><br>Let 1000 flowers bloom, and all that.<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c3418102787520504145 title="comment permalink">7/1/10, 9:33 AM</a><br><br>

I've been coming to the realization over the past few years that my generation (I'm 30) will be the critical one because we will be able to link the past with the future. An example - a mere 80 years ago, my grandfather, at the age of 9, knew how to grow his own food, harvest it, cook it, recycle that which he did not eat, and fix what was needed for all of the aforementioned processes. A 9 year old today knows what french fries are but quite possible would not be able to identify a potato. I have felt that those in my generation who are willing to step up to the challenge are going to be the linkage between the old knowledge and the new world. I fear that the collapse of society will bring about a time not unlike the post-Roman Dark Ages. People then did not save the old knowledge and had to rebuild it over 1000 years. It is not surprising that 'the wizard' was invaluable in society. Perhaps I have just now recognized something about myself - my lifelong desire to absorb knowledge like a sponge has a purpose - perhaps I am to be one of these transitioners from the old to the new. Seems like a daunting task but one that now has clarity. Thanks for continuing to offer a cristal ball.

I am glad to see that the direction of this blog in the next few months will be toward instruction, i.e. toward how we cope in a practical sense with the coming, less abundant, times.<br><br>Barring some kind of very traumatic war, financial disaster (followed by a war or several) or tremendous natural disaster like an asteroid strike, super-volcano or devastating poisoning of the oceans by some horrendous drilling accident (nah, that'll never happen, shouldn't have even mentioned it), we will be on a long, slow slide to...less. I fully agree that we all need to do whatever we practically can to ameliorate the effects of depending on fossil fuels, to cushion the blow, to extend the lifetime of fossil fuel use as much as possible, until we learn how to live on a sustainable basis. What appears below this has to do with material things, but as is usual with us humans, what really matters is things of the mind - in this case learning and passing on skills that will work in a world with less convenient physical resources. We would do worse than to learn the skills that our great grandparents lived with, including the use of the tools of their age (updated for practical improvements wherever possible).<br><br>Toward that end (ameliorating the effects of depending on fossil fuels), here is my small contribution: take a gander at these websites, and also at those dealing with permiculture. It wouldn't be a bad thing if most suburban households had a fruit tree or two, so perennial berry-producing bushes and some chickens, goats or rabbits.<br><br>http://homepower.com/home/ <br><br>http://solarcooking.org/ <br><br>http://www.simplesolarhomesteading.com/<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c6867233675498478388 title="comment permalink">7/1/10, 9:58 AM</a><br><br>

Looking at my first few cans of veggies put away for winter and knowing I make enough at my job to buy the equivalent at the store while taking a cigarette break just made me see how much physical labor is being substituted by cheap oil energy and how much it effects our lives everyday.

To me it reflects a complete lack of knowledge and respect for what goes into making a serviceable item from the fiber to the finished product. <br><br>As I become more immersed in such past times as weaving, and learning traditional methods of knitting/crocheting, I realize the wisdom and skill of our ancestors -- the fewer seams you have in a garment, for example, the longer it will last as seams represent a weak point. The fewer times you cut a garment to put it together, the longer it will last as removing the selvage edges makes the fabric weaker. Hence knitting in the round, and garments made from woven cloth using straight seams and gussets. <br><br>I'm all for appropriate technology, but I think we can have a little beauty with our practicality as well.

But I also think part of the cause is that we've become a people who have given up so much control over the every day basic aspects of our lives, that we have become too accustomed to living on blind faith. <br><br>For example, most of us don't really know how the food we require to survive gets to our grocery stores - and in fact, many people are so clueless about this subject that they don't even know how the raw ingredients are prepared and made into the meals they eat, because they buy almost everything already made and even already cooked, so all they have to do is warm it up in a microwave, if even that much effort is required! So, for most people in the "modern world," nearly everything they need to survive is contained (mentally) within the confines of this big "black box of amazing technology" and they haven't a clue what goes on inside of it. So after several generations, it is not surprising that we have become a culture of so-called adults who treat even the most basic necessities of life as if they were "magic" - appearing just when and where and how we need them in order to sustain our lives. All we have to do is come up with the proper "incantation" or "offering" and it's ours to consume. (dollar bills, credit card numbers, etc.) <br><br>As I've said before - we've Peter Principled ourselves. We're (nearly all of us) totally incompetent to understand the interdependent complexities of the world we ourselves have created. Faith in technology isn't just a convenient way for some of us to avoid thinking about the future - it's <i>how most of us actually live, every day of our lives.</i><br><br>I think this life of blind faith that our needs will be provided for us magically by the industrial system (technology) is part of the reason why so many people refuse to take seriously the possibility that "The Machine" may someday "Stop."<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c6462996812799092708 title="comment permalink">7/1/10, 11:45 AM</a><br><br>

I just love the term Green Wizard. It appears to encapsulate so many dimensions to it...I just can't wait to become a fully fledged one! In the meanwhile I'd like to share with you all a few of my experiences concerning raising awareness about Peak Oil in my country Mauritius which is so far away from the US and so very different too. Within my organisation, we tried many approaches to convey the dynamics of Peak Oil and its probable consequences. We began in 2002, believe it or not! We wrote newspaper articles, published leaflets, ran film shows, symposiums, radio talk shows, seminars, diners functions, private meetings with trade unions or with business people. We even managed to have a major local newspaper editor write articles on Peak Oil. TO NO AVAIL. My country is just as blissfully unprepared as any other. The same stubborn refusal to contemplate a different future from the Business as Usual scenario as detailed on this blog was also apparent in Mauritius too. <br>In the end we realised that there was nothing we could do to mitigate severe consequences for Mauritius and its people. The best we could do was to continue to speak hoping that as things unfold some people who may have heard us might understand a bit better what is happening around them and begin to implement some measures that would benefit them like home composting and organic gardening, (and yes we talked a lot about those things too!). In effect we came to the conclusion that: "Our World, as we know it, is dying slowly but surely. The new world to come, is yet to be born. The transition, though difficult, is not impossible." <br>Our role was then to disseminate ideas like seeds on a barren soil in the hope that when the rains come, some seeds would germinate. Yet even that did not satisfy us, we came to understand that as Gandhi said (if I am correct): "Be the change you want to see in the world". <br>We believe that if change there is to be, it can come only through active example. So if you want people to take up compost at home for instance, start by doing it yourself, (which we have been doing for years!). In that perspective, the idea of a green wizard is very attractive, it is like a living library of knowledge in action that helps mitigate the dire consequences of Peak Oil (and other crisis) onto society. <br><br>Via the Green Wizard, JMG has re-created an archtype that describes very powerfully what we perhaps all want to be: a helping hand to those around us. <br><br>Many thanks to you, Sir.<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c7857956923749039055 title="comment permalink">7/1/10, 12:10 PM</a><br><br>

It was my first opportunity to conceive of Merlin as someone more than just a guy with a pointy hat and a crystal ball. Since then I've studied and come to idolize Merlin and romanticize the age of Arthur. And I like to imagine myself as following, perhaps lamely, in the Merlinian tradition.<br><br>So, the title of this post really got my attention. And your text certainly didn't disappoint.

Any task that can be performed with human energy and hand-tools, rather than electric or fuel-driven machines and electronics, will be, from treadle- and hand-sewing, to baking, to small engine diagnostics and maintenance, hand-tool carpentry, metal fabrication, etc., as you have suggested. But scarcity will dictate that the bulk of any building process will begin with finding old things and dismantling them, or fixing them in the first place, as raw materials grow scarcer and scarcer. For a cook, that process will be wholly reliant on the climate, the soil, and the local food economy. <br><br>Two years ago, inspired by the growing wave of localvores, my wife and I, along with many in my community, took shares in local CSA's. When the CSA's started their weekly deliveries, most of us were naively unprepared for a) lack of choice in our vegetables, and therefore b) eating rigidly seasonally, and furthermore, c) the sheer volume of groceries that explode out of the local farms when the fertile matrix is in bloom. The unexpected stream of food into our homes brought about a second wave: enthusiastic cultish interest in food preserving and canning. <br><br>This is a trendy interest that is a direct result of the rise in popularity of the green movement, and through it the CSA's. And I just realized: these well-meaning folks are not reversing the decline. They are practicing skills that will be needed when it accelerates. <br><br>Most of the folks I am talking about (myself included) are technology geeks: programmers and builders who operate the pinnacle systems you have described, the devices that sit at the tiny apexes of enormous pyramids of time, energy, physical labor, and rare metals. It's ironic -- or maybe inevitable -- that these technology wizards are so enthusiastic about learning green wizardry.

A really good, thoughtful read is Matthew B. Crawford's "Shop Class as Soul Craft: An Inquiry into the Value of Work." How "we" lost a lot of important skills as a society and how it is imperative that we get them back.<br><br>I have two friend, Elvin and Tom. Elvin is my go-to guy for all things wiring, plumbing and carpentry. Tom and I worked on my roof and he intuitively knew how to fix the roof. I'm basically and happily the light holder and go-for. <br><br>Both these guys are always running themselves down. Oh, they're so dumb, etc. etc.. I keep pointing out to them that they are not 'dumb.' They have important skill that are USEFUL! They see me as smart (ha!) and I have no idea why they bother to hang out with such a useless drone as me.<br><br>But, I'm getting better. When I started working on the store, I needed more shelving. I ended up building this unit (more like putting tinker-toys together) with 2 x 4s and shelf links. 12 feet long and 6 feet high and wide enough to put books on both sides. It is THE biggest thing I have ever built. It's pretty wonky at the bottom and gets better toward the top, as I figured out what I was doing. Next I want to build a small solar dryer. My CSA boxes are getting out of hand and I hate waste. I want to put some of it up for the winter.<br><br>(PS to the Arch Druid. You can strike this part.

However, there's no lesser quality of living or sacrifice ... so it's not really a definite look at the future. They might hang their clothes to dry, but you don't often hear about them finding alternatives to a washer. Baby steps with good intent I guess.<br><br>Anyway, my husband has the fantastic opportunity to go to school for around 2 years and get paid for it (GI Bill, recently expanded). He's doing a wood crafts program, which seems like it could be useful as a base of knowledge, though I wish there were more info on stuff like coppice forestry at schools as well. There's a folk school nearby that has similarities with the green wizardry you're speaking of--they teach blacksmithing and basic stuff like that, in weekend or day classes. And a lot of anarchist publications focus on self-reliance and basic green wizardry skills, like rainwater collection and DIY dandelion wine and so on.

This is especially so if you are trying to be even somewhat honest about it (as in we will be living with less energy in the future and avoiding the word “third world”).<br><br>Many towns and villages in the area are doing climate change action plans. Getting them to realize that cutting carbon emissions by 20% by 2020 is the least of their worries is probably an unattainable goal at least for now. Much of this county is quite affluent, so you have that additional level of fantasy and denial.<br><br>Thus, I've been coming to the conclusion that doing what Transition calls reskilling training might be the most useful thing possible to do. Since this county has a Master Gardener program, perhaps bringing a Master Conserver program to it would be extremely worthwhile. This county may be affluent, but there are many to whom this would be a lifeline.<br><br>By the way, Muddling Toward Frugality is being reissued, with a publication date of August 2010.<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c8820808343204702842 title="comment permalink">7/1/10, 6:35 PM</a><br><br>

I teach what I know. <br><br>Ruben, that feeds into some things I'll be discussing down the road a bit. Thanks for the link!<br><br>Adamatari, I've seen the same thing happen in conversations about energy -- a weird and pervasive mental block. As for Hawai'i, the big problem it faces these days is a population grown vastly beyond what the islands can support. Once that's past, things will probably work out well, but getting past that is unlikely to happen without some pretty horrific scenes. <br><br>Avery, the culture that might honor and connect to these techniques hasn't been born yet. That's part of our predicament; we are between a death and a difficult birth. <br><br>Teresa, we'll begin to open the dread tomes of green wizardry next week!<br><br>Onion, I know the feeling. With me it's gardening; if I don't have the chance to get elbow deep in compost and dance the seasons with plants, I have a hard time staying sane. <br><br>Tim, that's exactly how wizards do their job -- anticipate the obvious that nobody else can see, then ride the wave of credibility to encourage changes. (Tolkien had that part down pat; look at the way that Gandalf manages the dwarves in <i>The Hobbit</i>. As for martial arts, heck of a good question. There were plenty of European fighting arts, and plenty of overlaps between them and religion (the warriorship of the Knights Templars comes to mind), but the specific fusion of fighting and mysticism that created the Asian martial arts as we know them didn't take place in the west -- evidence, if any more is needed, that linear theories of cultural evolution don't work too well. <br><br>Brian, as Bill Pulliam points out, the techniques can come first and bring the mindshift in their wake. You don't have to understand that all things are connected to use a compost bin -- but as you use a compost bin, you'll start to learn that all things are connected. <br><br>Richard, glad to hear it. <br><br>WestOz, congrats! My wife spins, using drop spindles -- one of those ancient skills that's the basis for an extraordinary range of useful crafts. If they're not ready for your poncho downtown, it's their loss. <br><br>Ramps, true enough!

The pattern I'll be using is the tree rather than the circle -- start from the roots, move up and out in one direction, retrace to the trunk, repeat as needed until we've covered the branches and leaves. <br><br>Andrew, it should. All of the stuff I'm talking about is part of a single pattern. <br><br>Skintnick, don't try to engage your neighbors. They'll make their own choices whatever you do. Instead, walk your own path; your neighbors, when they're ready, will lean over the fence one day and say, "So how the heck do you get your garden to come out so well with no sprays or anything?" Then you tell them. <br><br>Raven, no, the sudden mass dieoff scenario is accepted by only some parts of the peak oil scene, and I'm not one of 'em. <br><br>Purity, I'd say it's time to follow those better dreams. <br><br>Anagnosto, are you familiar with Manfred Junius' book on herbal alchemy? It might make a useful bridge between your scholarly studies and the alchemical literature. <br><br>Joe, exactly. It's time to learn how to be something other than an inconveniently biological adjunct to machines. <br><br>GreenStrong, I'd stayed away from talking about my own spirituality here for some years, since I wanted to talk about something different -- the issues surrounding peak oil and the future -- in a way that could be accessible to people who don't share my beliefs. My two books <i>The Long Descent</i> and <i>The Ecotechnic Future</i> say pretty much everything I have to say about that topic, though, and I've worked through the related topic of ecological economics as well -- expect the book on that next year. Appropriate tech is a different kind of subject, and can be approached in a different way -- and there will be more conversations later on, about other subjects. <br><br>Ragnorakk, enjoy!<br><br>Jim, that's a thoughtful analysis. I've rolled my eyes often enough at Kurzweil's rehashing of Rapture theology in technological drag, but you're quite right that he's a very good engineer. As for the ship metaphor, though, my sense all along has been that the ship is sinking; the question now is what life rafts can be found or cobbled together in a hurry. <br><br>Edde, neither community nor organizing are what I'm trying to discuss here. We need to talk a bit about what the individual can do when his or her community is eagerly headed the other way en masse. <br><br>Conch, have you tried eating the iguanas? I've had more than a few carnivorous thoughts toward our local woodchuck population...<br><br>Jim, the back story's important, and so is talking about where we're headed, but as I said to GreenStrong above, I've said most of what I want to say about that. Now it's time to roll up the sleeves a bit and get to work. As for music -- absolutely, but that's something I'm not qualified to teach; my dulcimer playing is strictly on an amateur level. <br><br>Patrick, one of the things I'd like to do -- though it's a topic for another set of posts -- is to encourage people to combine the liberal education (can one even use that phrase any more?) with the hands-on craftsmanship. The two are profoundly complementary. More on this another time. <br><br>Pat, we'll be getting to that book (and others) in its turn. Good to have another veteran of the last energy crisis on board!<br><br>Tideshift, true enough, but I'd like to see it happen outside any one organization. <br><br>Professor, thank you! Drop me a line sometime via info (at) aoda (dot) org; it occurs to me that we have more than enough interests in common to make for good conversations.<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c2593528034966903483 title="comment permalink">7/1/10, 7:44 PM</a><br><br>

Yes, and I'm sure there will be pressure in the direction of organizing this. I want to move in the other direction entirely -- toward an utterly unorganized topography of basement inventors, backyard gardeners with dreams, solar power geeks with taped eyeglasses building weird hybrid water heaters from plans sketched on the backs of napkins, that sort of thing. The crisis of industrial society is what EF Schumacher called a divergent problem -- one that doesn't have a single solution -- and we need dissensus, not consensus, if we're to come up with adequate responses to it.<br><br>BJ, those independent studies are crucial. The last thing I want is for the specific stuff I pass on to be treated as the be-all and end-all of the subject. <br><br>Patrick, we could get into a long conversation about the way that the basic presuppositions of modern science import exactly the biases and subjective factors that the method is supposed to exclude. Still, your basic point is valid; the scientific method is a tool, and a valuable one, and the way that it's been systematically misused (and left unused) under the pressure of economic and cultural forces isn't the fault of the tool. I'll be discussing the use of scientific method down the road a bit; I hope you'll add to that discussion. <br><br>Rudi, well, I tried to make that clear. Still, if I didn't manage it, I didn't. As for the bibliography, that'll be forthcoming, a chunk at a time -- there is a *lot* of literature, much of it good, to discuss. <br><br>Wendy, get that pointy hat. I know a small but growing number of people who have been doing just that for some years now; they (and you) are part of the next wave of green wizards. <br><br>Darius, good to have you in the conversation!

Good for you. <br><br>Pgrass, exactly. One of the projects I've been helping to develop in my (limited!) spare time, the <a href=http://www.culturalconservers.org rel=nofollow>Cultural Conservers Foundation</a>, is aimed at finding ways to help preserve all kinds of cultural heritage through the approaching mess. It's a major need, and needs plenty of careful thought and action. <br><br>Andre, if you were starting down a trail that went over a cliff, and I warned you of that fact, would I be caught in an either-or trap? Once you ask "How does one start moving them along?" you're heading toward the cliff, because the answer is that you can't. If you stake your hope for the future on moving them, you'll find instead that they will move you. Still, I've discussed this in previous posts, and I don't propose to rehash it further. <br><br>JF, good. Yes, it'll be your generation and the two or three that follow who will be the critical bridge this time. <br><br>Paul, we'll be getting to the subjects covered on those websites in due time!

My guess is that traditional lore and lifeways are going to be much more relevant than most people expect, especially in economically marginal areas such as rural Alaska. <br><br>Patrick, what is it about Tennessee? The Druid order I head has more members there than in most other states, and I keep hearing from people in that state who have a surprisingly clear sense of what's going on and what needs to be done for the future. I'm beginning to think that fifty years from now, when California is a basket case region of rusting skyscrapers and disused factories, and Phoenix and Las Vegas are little more than abandoned ruins, Tennessee may be full of organic farms and small-scale green industry, and the core of whatever prosperity we've got in this country. <br><br>Fleecenik, if you're ready to teach others how to do those things, you're qualified to put on the pointy hat with the moons and stars on it. <br><br>SlowCrash, good for you. The skills you've learned will make whatever the future brings easier to weather. Be ready to teach them!<br><br>Kevin, good. Our solar dryer's a year or so away -- weatherizing the house, getting the garden up and running, and building cold frames comes first -- but that's a solid technology; I look forward to replacing our electric dehydrator with a solar one. <br><br>Tinfoil, I understand about the job. Right now, for most people, making a living doing something worthwhile simply isn't an option. Until that changes, minimizing one's expenses, limiting the amount of time that has to go into one's day job, and doing one's best during free time is often the best option there is. <br><br>Don, yes, there'll be a book out of this. As for appropriate tech books, I'll be discussing quite a few in the weeks to come. If you've got a local used bookstore, go check out the shelf (it's usually in an out of the way corner) where they keep the "naked hippie books" -- see what you can find, and trust your own sense of value; you may well come up with wonderful books that I've never heard of. <br><br>Hal, that's one excellent place to start. <br><br>Teresa, that's an intriguing analysis. I wonder how much of it is also suppressed fear that the Machine <i>might</i> Stop. <br><br>Karim, that's good to hear! Those of us in America and Europe can use the reminder that some of the same problems and predicaments are at work elsewhere on the planet, and that some of the same ideas make sense.<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c8118719923837048476 title="comment permalink">7/1/10, 8:58 PM</a><br><br>

It's not a bad plan. <br><br>Arabella, with me it was Mary Stewart's <i>The Crystal Cave</i> -- insofar as it wasn't Gandalf, who has so much in common with the Merlin legends. It's a potent archetype and one that has a lot to teach. <br><br>Nox, we can't reverse the decline. All we can do is cope with its impact on our lives and communities. The fact that people are starting to learn the skills involved, however faddish the motivations, is a good thing. <br><br>John, I'm already on it -- all these essays are rough drafts for future books! (And, I might add, the comments, suggestions, and criticisms I get from readers here have helped immensely with my books on peak oil and green topics generally.) <br><br>Shark, okay, you get tonight's gold star. Another excellent song. <br><br>Lewis, I know the feeling -- my first woodworking projects were a bit rough. (By the way, I can't edit comments -- all I can do is publish or reject. Pass on my best to Ella!) <br><br>Matt and Jess, of course there are plenty of ways to learn! I've just noticed that a lot of the people with whom I come into contact in this context want to know the sort of thing the old appropriate tech people knew, but don't know how to find the knowledge or where to start. My plan is to fix that. <br><br>As for woodworking, my basic rule of thumb is that anything that was considered a useful craft in 1920 will be a useful craft in the near to middle future. Does that include woodworking? You bet. <br><br>William, if that's where your passion is, follow it. Finding ways to pass quantum physics onto the future is quite a challenge, but I suspect people felt the same way about Aristotle's metaphysics or the astronomical writings of Ptolemy. <br><br>Kurt, granted, the word "green" has been abused, misused, and overused; I simply wasn't able to think of a better one-word label. <br><br>Colin, that question has become so muddied and muddled a battlefield among factions in the contemporary gender politics wars that I'm not going to venture onto it. <br><br>Gauk, the problem with the Foundation model is funding. As a civilization winds down, its ability to pay its bills winds down too, and anything that depends on a steady income stream from something other than its own unaided efforts is going to be in deep trouble. Thus the need to find other options; I'm working on them, as of course so are others. <br><br>Doctor, there'll be plenty of reading lists, broken down by subject, in the posts to come.

The problem is that when encountering a religious myth, they expect it to be literally true or false.

Still, that’s an example of what the Renaissance alchemist Michael Maier called a lusus serius, a game played in earnest, a dead serious joke."<br><br>This reminds me so much of a favorite of mine, a stanza from Frost's "Two Tramps in Mud Time":<br><i>But yield who will to their separation,<br>My object in living is to unite<br>My avocation and my vocation<br>As my two eyes make one in sight.<br>Only where love and need are one,<br>And the work is play for mortal stakes,<br>Is the deed ever really done<br>For Heaven and the future's sakes. </i><br><br><br>@aangel:<br>I know from personal experience whereof you speak (the "spousal disconnect"). I think it's probably a common occurrence. The best I have to offer is persistence, a knowledge of my audience, and the importance of "starting from where you are". If your "audience" doesn't "get" the whole story, and you know your audience well enough, you might be able, a bit at a time, to give them a bit that they can "get". (Don't make the mistake of thinking that you're moving them, though -- they have to "move" under their own power -- and it might not be in the direction that you'd prefer. Take that as a learning opportunity.) "If you're two steps ahead of everyone else, you're a crackpot. If you're one step ahead, you're a genius."<br><br>Another thought, addressed to all here: if you'll pardon the optimistic tone, one way to look at the wizards' journeys, and the journeys that others here describe, is not in terms of a decline, but a growing new sere -- and yes, by some measures, a better one. As Tagore put it, "And when old words die out on the tongue, new melodies break forth from the heart; and where the old tracks are lost, new country is revealed with its wonders. " Will the ascent be accompanied by pain and suffering? Of course; all real accomplishments have these companions; how could it be otherwise?<br><br>One final thought: Some of the commenters here have mentioned their geographic location, and I think there are probably "centers" where some of them could begin to make contacts, online at first, then in person (e.g., Tennessee). JMG, how could this blog (or other site we could set up) serve to facilitate creating such a network (maybe even involving Californians 8^), rather than being bound by the limitations of these comment sequences?<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c8272643831453298292 title="comment permalink">7/1/10, 11:06 PM</a><br><br>

In "The Long Descent", you reference "Limits to Growth", for instance. Limits to growth indicates a population curve that peaks and then dips into the negative around mid-century. It's been postulated that if birth rates remain unchanged, the death rates required in order to force that curve to level off and decline over the short span of a decade or two would make tragedies like WWII seem absolutely trivial. Whichever of the 4 horsemen are required to accomplish that, it's unlikely that the world would be stable enough to host "green wizards" patiently doling out sage wisdom from their neighborhood urban homestead, surrounded by hungry ex-yuppies. We're not just talking about people losing their healthcare and seniors dying of heat stroke each summer. We're talking about something probably worse than the plagues of europe in scale.<br><br>Therefore the objective of most peak oil activism is to stretch that curve out, or make the curve express itself more through declining births rather than increased deaths, so as to reduce the world's suffering.<br><br>The only way that's going to happen is if a large percentage of humanity suddenly changes how it behaves, like yesterday. This absolutely requires a movement, whether it comes from the top down (Plan B) or bottom up (Plan C). As Hirsch said, waiting until the frog in the pot boils will only insure the worst case scenario. Why would that worst case scenario NOT involve a die-off when Al Bartlett, Catton, Paul Ehrlich, the LTG guys, etc... have all made the case for it?<br><br>I know you don't want to go this far back and rehash this again, but your whole argument rests on this, so it's critical.<br><br>If you don't think a die-off is gonna happen, do you at least hold out the distinct possibility that it might? If so, why not wish these movements well from the sidelines? What's the harm?<br><br>My feeling is that Plan A is ecologically irresponsible, Plan B is a nice fantasy but not politically feasible (think Nopenhagen), and the jury is still out on Plan C. Once you get to Plan D, you have to have a mild enough vision of collapse for people to begrudgingly flip over into a peaceful powerdown mindset rather than the Mad Max scramble scenario. And once you get to Plan E you're in Cormac McCarthy territory in which the future is so grim that many of us won't even care if we survive or not.<br><br>I can "root" for Plan B and C. Once you get to D and E, if those people are spending a lot of their time trying to discourage Plan B or Plan C guys, then it's harder for me to root for them, even though in the end their strategy may be vindicated.<br><br>I just have a hard time understanding why these can't all operate in parallel. I don't believe in techo-fix, but if my pessimistic view of the future is incorrect, maybe it would be better if the techno-fixers gave it a shot and we got lucky and suddenly the whole world is covered with solar panels and wind turbines. Meanwhile, we can still have transition towns moving from the bottom up, and so on.<br><br>I've been trying to settle on the question of fast/medium/slow crash since I first learned about peak oil over five years ago and I think the best approach is not to put all your eggs in one basket but to see it more as a range of probabilities, as Holmgren does. As such, you want to support things that would cover as wide a range of future scenarios as possible.<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c3155695536413098765 title="comment permalink">7/1/10, 11:27 PM</a><br><br>

As an observation though to some of the commenter's, I think it displays peoples sense of entitlement when they ask if they can make a career out of this at present. Are they serious?<br><br>The timing for making a career with this path seems simple enough, acquire the skills now and when the opportunity arises in the future to share and utilise the skills with others for reward should be pretty obvious. Don't expect to be rewarded greatly, but it should give you an edge and an ability to walk through conflict mostly unharmed. Well hopefully anyway.<br><br>I think food, drink and lodging would be fair reward for these types of services.<br><br>Basically you just have to start learning and doing. Concentrate on food, water, local traditional medicines, shelter and fuel and you'll be way ahead of the pack. <br><br>In essence the reason that our peers aren't interested in these types of messages or downshifting at present is because they are basically off enjoying consuming. If and when they are hungry and cold though they'll be singing a different tune.<br><br>Interestingly enough there's been a titanic shift in Western culture over the past few decades when people's standing in society is judged by what they consume rather than what they produce. This is certainly a great source of present trouble.<br><br>On the positive thinking culture, I think that this may have evolved in frontier cultures. Some older and more established cultures don't seem to share this positive thinking to the same extent or so I have noticed.<br><br>As to dualism in thinking, I've never understood it and wondered about it. As a suggestion, maybe it is easier for people to frame arguments as a dualistic approach as they maintain a semblance of control and we've all become accustomed to that method of lazy thinking? There are certainly many paths to take when confronted by a choice/problem/predicament and not all of them are obvious or appropriate at first.<br><br>JMG, a word of advice although you probably don't need it - in the next 12 months don't get too bogged down in the details or you maybe effectively derailed. I've seen subordinates working this magic on their managers. Very effective magic! A good example is explaining making compost to build soil and recycle waste. You don't need to explain the detail of the science behind it, just how to make it. The science behind it whilst interesting is possibly not as important to know as the process itself. As Arthur C Clarke stated any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. You don't need to understand the workings of a computer to be able to access the Internet.<br><br>I imagine Merlin didn't have a university to go to but was simply an ultra intelligent and observant individual?<br><br>Good luck and Regards!<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c1149377500392168497 title="comment permalink">7/2/10, 5:31 AM</a><br><br>

I've covered it in quite a bit of detail -- including the extensive population declines we'll be seeing in the decades and centuries to come -- in <i>The Ecotechnic Future</i> and quite a few posts here as well; furthermore, it's irrelevant to the theme of this and upcoming posts -- the green wizards project will be viable in almost any plausible future (I should say I don't consider Cormac McCarthy fantasies to be plausible).

A "bottom up" movement comes about from many people pursuing action as individuals and small units who then gradually grow together. It does not begin with ideas and mission statements circulated in an organized fashion via the internet and at conferences. It begins around a million kitchen tables as people try do decide how they will live. They may look to the internet and conferences and such for ideas, but the real movement begins when they individually chose to move. <br><br>The only person whose actions you can control is yourself. You can't even control your own spouse or children, much less a planet full of strangers. Live your life the way you think everyone ought to; what else can you do? Maybe you think that everyone ought to be out organizing communities for collective change. But just think about that for a second... if everyone were out organizing for collective action, who would actually be doing anything? If everyone spent all their time in meetings discussing issues, writing proposals, and making action plans, who would actually be out there doing all the massive amounts of work on a huge scale? Being involved with a community is not at all the same thing as being a promoter trying to compel community to organize and move in a particular specified fashion.

They’ll more likely focus on the surface explanations. I see the same thing even among brilliant historians today, who refer to Rome’s Third Century “crisis.” Nice euphemism. Honey, it was cooked. Anything after the “crisis” was merely electric shocking the corpse. But, after all, people are people and only focus on the façade. Try to tell that to the Kaiser, Tsar, or Holy Roman Emperor. I don’t think that will ever change, as long as we have hands and feet. <br><br>“History celebrates the battlefields whereon we meet our death, but scorns to speak of the plowed fields whereby we thrive. It knows the names of the king’s bastards but cannot tell us the origin of wheat. This is the way of human folly.” – Jean-Henri Fabre<br><br>Good luck on this venture.

We have become the go to people in my area for cheap and easy gardening tips and advice as well as species identification. I was lucky in growing up on my grandfather’s farm and learning his country wisdom and how to do without, and my wife grew up Mennonite, so we both came from different backgrounds than most of our contemporaries. This has given both of us skill sets that are uncommon in our national culture, I am always surprised at how few people know how to cook, they can heat things up but they can’t take raw ingredients and turn it into tasty nutritious food.<br><br>I have hooked up with local beekeepers and old time musicians but having a place where I can direct all of these various groups to for them to add (or at least map there location) their knowledge base would make it easier for people to find these green wizards.

You, sir, are that doctor; but instead of telling us that we're going to die, you're telling us that we are facing a fate worse than death, at least as far as most people are concerned. What? No more gasoline or electricity or iPhones? Let's see, what's that first stage? Oh, yes... it sounds like that river in Egypt.<br><br>Depending on how it all falls apart, we could all end up living like something out of the Whole Earth Catalog (which I used to fantasize over back in the '70s, after smoking a little home-grown), or it could turn out a lot worse. <br><br>We have to remind ourselves that a lot of great civilizations flourished before the advent of fossil fuels and electricity and modern medicine. With even a modicum of modern knowledge in chemistry, biology, metallurgy, etc, we could theoretically have a fairly decent future after the fossil fuels go away. <br><br>One thing that I worry about is the prospect that some anti-technological religious movement will spring up, and people will start burning the libraries instead of trying to preserve them. It would be like something out of a bad science fiction story: "Those damned scientists got us into this mess and almost got us all killed with their pollution-spewing technology and weapons of mass destruction, and we have to make sure they are never able to do that to us again..." <br><br>If things get really bad, we'll definitely need a modern equivalent of one of those 7th century monasteries that preserved so much ancient knowledge. I would hope that this particular scenario is not necessary, which means we all really will have to do our small part to learn and diseminate as much useful knowledge as possible.<br><br>On a related note, do you or any of your regular readers have a rough idea of how many acres of land would be required to provide a person with a reasonably balanced diet for a year, using only available sunlight and no external sources of N, P or K? I'm thinking an acre would be the bare minimum, except you'd actually need more for fallow ground, crop rotation, meat and manure production, etc, so that the land really could sustain adequate crop yields indefinitely without external inputs. Our little suburban garden is nice (all the neighbors are gaga about our tomato plants), but it's nowhere near enough to feed us for a whole year, especially without extra fertilizer. In order to have a sustainable post-carbon society, how much land will we need in order to survive for the long run?<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c8684748527276857361 title="comment permalink">7/2/10, 10:22 AM</a><br><br>

You rock. <br>Now here's a dangerous idea: Could we build intrigue around green wizardry amongst the Facebook hordes and all of the other techies who have access to all of the online DIY instructions? Should we make "Green Wizard" sashes and merit badges? You could totally make a Facebook app for that. I'm only partially joking and if I had the time, I would do it. :D I know people with PhDs who are playing FarmVille on Facebook (for the uninitiated, this is a virtual farming game). If people could take the next step from playing a farmer online to actually doing something constructive...wow. (See the video on Cognitive Surplus: http://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_cognitive_surplus_will_change_the_world.html) Use internet addiction to get people off of the internet - the sooner the better.<br>"You've earned the Rainwater Harvesting First Flush Diverter Installation Badge, congratulations!" "You taught a nearby tent city how to build Off-Grid Washing Machines!" (http://www.make-digital.com/make/vol18/?pg=62#pg62) <br><br>I also have relatives who only have access to the web at the library. And btw, our nearby library just started cutting hours due to budget cuts, so that library net access is looking grim. There are old-timers in town who know how to get by - not all knowledge descends from the web. But if the people who are blessed with web access were encouraged to put what they learn into action (and one step better - in their local communities in a public way), they would become the neighborhood 'wizards' someday. <br><br>I'm not proposing that social web technology can cure all of our ills - but it could be an appropriate transition technology. Children around the world are already using village computers to learn. I like the idea of those of us in industrialized societies who see the white swans quietly learning our skills. I agree with Dave Wahler, we're going to need a LOT more people than we have now. One possible solution? Motivate the my-life-is-a-reality-show hordes, test the idea of virtual 'green wizard' merit badges (with bonus points for uploaded videos or photos of the home-grown windmill in action). And start it as a grassroots thing (no national T.V. show sponsors), otherwise it loses its appeal to a generation that mostly rejects big brands.<br><br>I look forward to reading the coming articles and intend to get away from the screen and off of my duff to do something so that the skills will be automatic when I'm called upon to share them.<br>Thanks for a dose of joie de vivre.

There are also entries on more ... feed the soul kinds of things. How to tell a bedtime story, how to make friends, how to volunteer or how to ask for help.<br><br>It's pretty basic, but has some web links.

I take pictures of my garden and post it to facebook. And then my friends respond by talking about their gardens or by posting their own pictures. I took a picture of a grilled pizza done in an outdoor oven, and some friends responded by posting pictures of their grilled pizzas. My neighbor planted flowers on her deck, I planted tomatoes. I saw flowers and thought "I need flowers too, I have nothing good for the bees." Then she planted tomatoes and I gave her some of my leftover seedlings, so now she has even more tomatoes. My neighbor on the other side saw my tomatoes and started talking about the tomatoes his dad grew.

Have a look at their websites if you want to see what is currently popular here. John Seymour's books were essential reading when I was younger but the one I love now is actually from the U.S. - 'The Enclyclopaedia of Country Living' by Carla Emery. Not many books would include a section of 'Giving Birth Alone' in chapter one! It has some sections that are not relevant to me in the U.K. but others, such as the bit on Alliums (!) for instance are top-quality. <br>I recently bought an old copy pf 'Radical Technology' by Boyle and Harper from a well-known internet bookseller. Partly it was out of nostalgia and partly for the brilliant set of 'Visions' drawings by Cliff Harper - they used to be on my wall in 1980! (There's one in Harper's wiki entry).

It’s raining (again) today, so I have a few minutes. :-)<br><br><i>the vast majority of people today simply do not want to hear how difficult their future is going to be.</i><br>Amen to that! That is the place that me and most of my well-meaning friends part: they are still so much a part of this consumer culture that they refuse to consider for a second that it might disappear. I, on the other hand, have shifted to a much more basic way of life (finally got the well guy to put a T-valve in for the backup handpump; now I just have to get it assembled and installed!) and even though I am working hard than they are, on a daily basis, I feel much less worried about the possible future, knowing that I can operate fairly well even if power is gone. And one thing that’s important to me is that I feel comfortable with this lifestyle <b>now</b>; it’s not just in case of a collapse. But it sure helps me prepare for that, too!<br><br>Other example: I just bought $48 worth of groceries today; that should get me through for a couple months, with the stuff in my freezer, shelves and garden. And I eat well – I just cook it all from scratch. When I mentioned it to my mother, she was flabbergasted (she still gets $40 pedicures, at age 80)… <b>not</b> how she raised me! ;-} She swears I get it from my farmer great-grandparents…<br><br>On the “to group or not to group” theme, I have never been a joiner, and I’ve had several really negative experiences with so-called “communities”, so it’s just as well that preparing oneself is a better way to go than dragging a group (or being dragged by one).<br><br>BTW, Al Stewart’s historical songs have been a favorite of mine. I’m in awe of how he gets his stories so rich and so flowing!<br><br><i>It’s for this reason, seemingly, that many people in the peak oil scene have chosen to downplay the difficulties and insist that we can have a bright, happy, abundant future</i><br>IMO, the “brighter future” listed in the TT and other movements should have an asterisk – having worked for a new-age publication, I found that most of those saying “bright future” meant “deep friendships, satisfaction with working with your hands, appreciating the natural world” – THAT kind of “brighter future”… but they rarely spell it out until you get further into their training… I have nothing against that definition, but truth in advertising is not evident here. <br><br>@Lamb: <i>I have spent my teen and adult life learning skills from the 17th-18th centuries without knowing why I felt compelled to do so.</i> – me too! I have no idea why I am so drawn to all those skills and methods, but I am glad of it now…<br><br>And JMG, I second your comment that you don’t need to know how it’s all connected in order to use a compost bin, but the bin will show you all things are connected. It reminds me of when my younger brother came for an extended visit and helped me turn the compost and laughed at my excitement about the rich compost… but after a couple months, when he saw the garbage he’d put in the pile turn into rich earth, he got excited, too! That’s why a good example is worth a ton of books. But I’m halfway through “The Long Descent” – good books are worth a lot, too!

I may just quote it in an upcoming post. <br><br>Teresa, true enough. <br><br>Raven, neither you nor I nor anyone alive today will have any say in who becomes the aristocracy of the feudal stage ahead of us; that won't start to form, remember, until the last scraps of the existing political structure come unglued, a couple of centuries from now. For that reason I'm mostly concerned with making sure that the raw materials for a viable human ecology are in place. <br><br>Pasttense, you ain't seen nothin' yet. Hang on to your hat. <br><br>Blue Sun, thank you! I'm sure there will be a phase two thousand years or so in the future when scholars learnedly talk about the transition out of industrialism in the twenty-first through twenty-third centuries of the old calendar, and soft-pedal how harsh and chaotic that age was. Still, that'll be a scholarly affectation, as its equivalent is today; say the phrase "the fall of the Roman Empire" in most settings these days and almost everyone will know, at least in a general sense, what you're talking about. <br><br>Wolf, alchemy is more than that, though it's not about manufacturing metallic gold -- "our gold is not the common gold," the old alchemists said over and over again, to mostly deaf ears. For that matter, magic is more than changing attitudes -- the possibilities open to making changes in consciousness in accordance with will go well beyond attitudes and opinions. Still, this isn't the place for that discussion. <br><br>Adrian, true enough.

It's much less if you go vegetarian and eat meat from sources that eat lots of scraps - think chicken, pig and goat.<br><br>Don't stress about the whole NPK thing. For a degraded block, try a one off top dressing of NPK and then bring in mulch - lots of mulch. With a few chickens scratching around you'll have top soil before you know it. Even without the chickens the local native animals will appreciate the additional nutrients.<br><br>If you have a good top soil to begin with I wouldn't touch NPK as you'll kill off some of the soil flora and fauna. Just recycle as much organic stuff back into the soil as you can. I mean anything, even the dead cat that someone ran over up the road has great value. Let the worms, microbes and fungi do their thing and you shouldn't have to worry.<br><br>You never said where you are in the world. If you have cold winters, I'd advise building a poly tunnel or glass house and heating it with compost. This could extend your growing period.

You're absolutely right that human civilizations can flourish on a very modest technological basis, and I've argued in <i>The Ecotechnic Future</i> and elsewhere that some of the less extravagant technologies of the last 300 years or so might be good for the long haul, and make it easier to maintain relatively sophisticated societies in the millennia to come. <br><br>As for minimum land areas for food production for a single person, if you don't mind a sparse vegan diet and are willing to practice intensive organic gardening with relentless recycling of organic materials, including your own feces, you can do it on 1000 square feet. That's the conclusion reached by David Duhon in <i>One Circle</i> (Ecology Action, 1985), on the basis of extensive experimentation. <br><br>Jen, I'll respond to both your posts below. <br><br>Zach, true enough. This notion that every opinion is equally valid is not going to survive a collision with reality, but it certainly makes things annoying just now. <br><br>Lewis, good!<br><br>Jolbytla, excellent.

One of the fundamental lessons here is to let things happen, don't make them happen. If you or anybody else wants to fill your social networks with excited posts about your green wizard work, by all means; that's much the same as planting your organic vegetable garden in the front yard so that all your neighbors can see it. Still, it's more important right now to do the work yourself than to try to get other people to do it. <br><br>Laura, I hope so!<br><br>Tom, the posters I had were by Diane Schatz -- very similar visions, done for <i>Rain</i> Magazine back when it was one of the leading appropriate-tech rags on this side of the pond.

Today's libertarian political movement wants to turn back the clock to the early 19th century, which is ecologically impossible.

In the last few years this area has been overrun by Californians and others who moved here because Money Magazine and other publications have been touting it as the best place in America to retire for several years in a row. That has not only pushed up property values in what had traditionally been a high-desert ranching area, but has put serious pressure on the local water supply.<br><br>We get our water from wells that have been slowly drawing down the local aquifer. Friends who have their own wells on their ranches tell us that their water pressure is slowly decreasing, and lots of folks around here are seriously worried about the long-term viability of this area. <br><br>Without electricity Arizona and the surrounding states can support only a fraction of their existing populations. If the grid goes down and the air conditioners stop running, and the irrigation canals that bring water from the Colorado River stop flowing, then much of Arizona (i.e., the major population centers around Phoenix and Tucson) will be relatively uninhabitable. <br><br>The population of the Arizona Territory back around the time that Wyatt Earp and Doc Holiday lived here (before petroleum, by a strange coincidence) was only a few thousand. Going back hundreds of years, there used to be some native civilizations that flourished for a while, and then mysteriously disappeared, leaving only cliff dwellings. Long-term drought conditions (like we may see as a result of global warming) probably contributed to their moving away. Now, there's something to look forward to...<br><br>So, we keep our little garden alive with well water, which will work for several years, but probably not forever. Tennessee or Missouri or some other place where water actually falls out of the sky on a regular basis would be more sustainable for the long run, so we will probably end up moving back east to build our final homestead (btw, JMG, now that you've been there for a year, how's Western Maryland working out for you?).<br><br>We have neighbors with chickens and goats (yummy cheese!), but so far we are still a little lower on the DIY food-growing learning curve. I understand perfectly well that subsistence farming is a lot of work (in the last century, millions people moved to the cities to take factory jobs rather than stay on the farm; gee, I wonder why...), but I find it to be very rewarding so far. <br><br>We have lots of cold frames and row covers for our raised beds, plus several compost bins, and a "worm ranch" in the back yard. We started with peat moss, perlite, potting soil, and various amendments (dolomitic lime, etc.) to enrich our naturally-occurring desert dirt, and keep topping it off with leaf mulch and composted horse manure (from the nearby rodeo grounds) whenever we harvest one crop and plant another. <br><br>This can best be described as fairly intensive square-foot gardening, rather than "real" farming. One thing we've discovered is that there IS such a thing as too many tomatoes (and Swiss Chard and spinach and carrots), so we've started canning our excess produce, and we're trying to eat the stuff we can't preserve as fast as it grows. Next year, we'll adjust our quantities yet again... <br><br>I consider what we are doing as a learning experience rather than a realistic attempt to completely feed ourselves. So far, so good, and we ARE learning what works and what doesn't. We don't want to jump into something that we aren't really ready for when we finally buy our little farm.<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c4222954187947468071 title="comment permalink">7/2/10, 9:21 PM</a><br><br>

I remember the card indexes &amp; mum typing every letter individually (anyone still use carbon paper?) and they worked hard and were content with their modest but sufficient income to support house/mortgage + 3 kids. (There seem to be lots of parallels between the 1970s and today.) In 1985 my graduate project was to write software to "computerise" their office and it worked ok (dBaseIII). Their 8088 Olivetti PC with 10Mb disk &amp; 64K RAM cost about $10K. I still have it in the attic.<br>When my eldest child was a baby (1995) and I got sick of commuting to London not seeing her, my wife &amp; I set up a similar business, being careful not to tread on parents' toes. It kept us well for 10 years but declined of late due to the internet. I've kept it going for pin money, and now have several part-time jobs which keeps life interesting - just experimenting with getting by on less income and trying to build resilience into our lifestyle, you know? The whole veggie plot &amp; chickens &amp; transition town adventure. Anyhow, to the point: I always keep in mind your assertion, JMG, that in due course the internet will become a less important use of precious electricity than other fundamental needs, and grind to a halt. And I wonder if that happens while I'm still alive, and people want out-of-print books when ABE or Amazon ain't there any more, whether my old business will make a comeback. Maybe one of my girls can run it... I've got one hell of a database (almost 10,000 records) of secondhand booksellers both here in the UK and in the US and elsewhere, although I guess lots of them will now be out of business. Sorry to go on about this but when you start talking about bookstores I got kinda excited :)<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c3070530462400942327 title="comment permalink">7/3/10, 4:31 PM</a><br><br>

But perhaps they did not: perhaps caves were secure places safe from the art-eroding action of weather, and were chosen to serve rather as art galleries now do, as places of repository for works worth preserving, to be enjoyed by firelight away from beasts and cold, as visual aids for storytelling perhaps - the figures seeming to move as the firelight flickers: proto-television. Is that harder to imagine than that our ancestors saw the rock-face as the membrane separating profane and sacred worlds?<br><br>In any case, it is hard to see why a propensity to religion would protect the Cro-Magnons against the Ice Age better than it protected the Neanderthals. Complex social organisation, foresight, skill, and language would certainly do this, and the Cro-Magnons had more of all these things than the Neanderthals did. The virtual lack of development in Neanderthal technology over a hundred thousand years suggests poor communication and poor imitation skills; to go extinct rather than to change in the face of new challenges even more potently denotes lack of both imagination and cognitive power.

Then he would make a sideboard or something. So why not. I still remember a fine –in my mind-- fence I built about 20 years ago with great affection.<br><br>I have a nagging concern with long term intensive gardening/farming that relates to something the brits learned the hard way a few years back with BSE. They fed ground up cows to other cows and considered this a sane and sustainable practice. --Moooo!! Soylent green is cattle!!!-- <br>Also you may or may not be aware that there is another neat little organism called toxoplasma gondii which can change the behaviour of rats so that they become attracted to the smell of cats. The cats then eat the rats and toxo completes its lifecycle through the cat.<br><br>Maybe if we examine the brains of the agriculture ministry types who were around at the time of BSE we would find that they were already infected with BSE and acting under its malign influence when making their “feed cows to cows” decisions. Note: I'm not suggesting we consider this possibility because its likely to be true, Im putting it forward only because:<br>1)It was such an obviously stupid thing for “health” officials to condone.<br>2)The delicious sense of irony* I experience when considering the idea of “dumb” bugs controlling “smart” people.<br><br>( * Irony: Gets the wrinkles out of your shirty)<br><br>But BSE and toxo do illustrate a point. The simpler or closer the loops in an artificial ecosystem become, the better opportunity there is for some organism (other than humans) to find a way of completing its life cycle within it. My bet is that for instance if the brits had fed their ground up cattle to fish and then turned the fish into fertiliser for maize which was then fed to the cattle, BSE wouldnt have happened. So what happens for instance if people decide to cut out the middlemen so to speak and just start taking dumps in the cauliflower patch?<br><br>Hi JMG<br>“the word "green" has been abused, misused, and overused; I simply wasn't able to think of a better one-word label.”<br>Turquoise?

The female half of that population probably knows how to kill, clean and cook them, too. The trick is finding a woman of that background who isn't too ashamed of her poverty-stricken past to tell you how to do it.<br><br>More generally, cooking from scratch is my wizard skill, both in that I need to do it every so often to stay sane and that it's nonessential now (and therefore getting rarer) but will be vital in the post-carbon future. When I was growing up, most working class moms stayed home and cooked from scratch; convenience foods (usually in the form known as the TV dinner) were expensive and therefore occasional treats. Since then, a job outside the home has become a necessity for most working class moms and the price of convenience food has fallen (relative to other consumer goods) to the point where it doesn't make short-term economic sense to cook from scratch, so a whole generation of non-college-bound kids have been raised on just-add-boiling-water this and freezer-to-nuke-to-table that, while the last place to find real cooking skills is, ironically, among upper-middle-class foodies, the people who keep Whole Foods going even in this economy. I am less worried about the professional classes than about blue collar kids who could starve to death surrounded by Nature's bounty, simply because they don't know how to make it into food.<br><br>I've started the house search, in a more urban location than I expected, for family reasons. A lot of the housing stock here was built between 1850 and 1930 for factory workers. The kitchen was typically the biggest room because it was a production center, getting raw materials in bulk in times of abundance, preserving them for lean times, and turning out meals for very large families three times a day. I hope to emulate them and eventually to teach what I've learned.<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c7329356488002918809 title="comment permalink">7/4/10, 5:27 AM</a><br><br>

So I guess I am an aspiring Green Witch rather than a Wizard.<br><br>However when it comes to 'technical' stuff such as building and installing solar water heating systems I don't think I will be able to do that myself so I will have to pay someone else to do it, ideally from within my local community.<br><br>So individual skill-development and lifestyle change and community need to go hand-in-hand, we need both. In terms of community in my experience it is very valuable to have contact with like-minded people and to mutually support each other in our endeavours to change our lives in the light of the emerging new social paradigm. <br><br>As you point out trying to move the people in our society who are still living by the old paradigm is a waste of time, but participating in community with those who are on the same wavelength is both emotionally, culturally and practically valuable.<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c653192803679195202 title="comment permalink">7/4/10, 11:13 AM</a><br><br>

One of the things that aspiring green wizards will have to get used to is that this stuff doesn't necessarily make, or save, a lot of money on a short term basis. The longer term is another matter, but it takes practice to take in that view. BTW, powering your laptop with solar cells is green wizardry, too -- while high tech is here, figuring out how to use it with low impact is a good thing. <br><br>Skintnick, that's a fascinating question to which I don't think anyone has the answer. One big question is how long the internet stays up -- my guess is until the next really big war breaks out and several countries get really messed up by cyberwarfare, but we'll see. I'm sure there will be a market for used books in the future; the question is simply how people will buy and sell them. <br><br>Wolf, most interesting. <br><br>Lewis, my guess is that used book stores have plenty of future ahead of them; the publishing industry these days is either totally dependent on massive distribution networks and economies of scale, or totally dependent on the internet, and we could go for quite a while in which very few new books are being printed at all (at least until the letterpress renaissance takes off). Of course libraries are getting shellacked by budget cuts these days. That leaves used book stores as one of the few options for the reading public. <br><br>Wordek, the key is to make the circles complex even though they're small. We'll be covering that. As for alternatives to green, well, unfortunately nothing else communicates the point as well. <br><br>Joanhello, that's serious magic; if you can't turn what you grow into tasty meals, half the point of growing it goes out the window. I assume you've got a collection of old cookbooks -- we've used those, especially old wartime cookbooks, to very good effect. <br><br>Edde, thank you. For me, music is a meditative practice; I have no idea if anyone else would enjoy the odd, somewhat mannered fingerpicking style I've evolved. Still, I'll keep it in mind!<br><br>Carina, exactly. Aristotle pointed out a long time ago that the opposite of a mistake is usually another mistake; the right choice is usually somewhere in between. This is a good example. <br><br>Peter, no argument there. When you get settled, by all means drop me a note c/o info (at) aoda (dot) org -- always good to make local connections. <br><br>Anne, nobody has the time to learn and practice all the skills that could fit into a grimoire of green wizardry. I hope you'll look into some of the simpler energy conservation methods we'll be covering, though -- they don't require the kind of hardware skills building a solar water heater from scratch requires. (Anybody can learn how to use a caulking gun.) <br><br>G, this is one of the reasons why it'll be important to focus on annual rather than perennial plants in food gardening; by the time your edible tree garden is mature enough to produce food, the climate may have changed enough that the trees won't bear fruit -- or won't survive. I'll be covering this as we proceed.<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c2027974002314866050 title="comment permalink">7/4/10, 5:17 PM</a><br><br>

I built a barn, completed the Master Gardener program at University of Maine, started a good-sized herb garden (now overgrown with neglect while I'm back in school), and have been on a slow but steady program to prepare for...the future you describe. Some events forced changes to my original plans, now it's more of a flow. This weekend I've been modifying my barn to allow for a small flock of chickens. And I'm waiting to see if the horses graze the corner of pasture they've refused to touch for 3 years (since a tree fell in the corner). Last call...if it's still there in the fall, it'll be rototilled and prepped for 2000 sq feet or so of growing. On order, as of last week, is a hotpot, so I can learn to cook solar.

There are plenty of doomsday scenarios out there, of course, but we've covered the psychology, mythology, and general lack of science and history behind those things pretty exhaustively over the last few years here. Many tree and shrubs crops can be brought to yielding in about 5 years and yielding heavily in much less than a full decade. Perennial herb crops (asparagus, rhubarb, strawberries, artichokes, etc.) can produce good yield in just a few years. So I would say yes definitely they have a role even in a world of global change, especially when you consider the nutritional and culinary diversity they can bring to your home-grown food supply.<br><br>Obviously, the way to deal with this is not to plant things that are anywhere near their hardiness limits in your current climate. And don't assume your spot will get uniformly warmer; all the models predict localized but persistent anomalies wherein peculiarities of atmosphere and ocean circulation can make some regions get colder even while the globe on average gets warmer. The cold winter we just had in the southeast U.S. was cause by abnormal warmth in the arctic messing with the circumpolar air flow. Patterns like that could settle in as a "new normal" for a decade or more. Plus, even in a warmer world, if your region also gets drier, you might see larger daily temperature swings and your frost-free season might actually get shorter even if your annual average temperature gets hotter! Ask anyone in the mid-latitude steppes and deserts about freezes in late May and early September that come literally out of the clear blue sky. <br><br>So... for example, if you live in USDA zone 7 at the present, don't plant things that only do well in zones 4-7, or in zones 7-9. Find things that do well in zones 5-9. If your annual average rainfall is 40", make sure the things you plant can perform well in a rainfall range of 25-60." And, of course, plant a diversity both of species and varieties; don't plant the whole orchard at once, but a few trees each year, adjusting as you see how things really are going in your microclimate. Plus, don't be shy about turning a tree that seems to fail every year into firewood and planting something else in its spot. <br><br>As a broader point, my experience with organic tree and shrub crops, as well as wild fruit and nuts, is that you tend to only get a heavy crop every 2nd or 3rd year on average, in a compeltely irregular schedule. Sometimes the reasons are obvious -- freezes, drought, etc. but much of the time it's just a mystery -- swimming in walnuts and apples this year, nary a speck next year, no obvious reason why. It's really bad when they are all in synch -- one year we had a 100% failure of blueberries, apples, hickories, peaches, cherries, persimmons, plums, and 1-year acorns all at the same time (thank the gods for the blackberries!). The wildlife populations are just now recovering from the famine that triggered. SO, food preservation is especially important for these crops that come in all at once, in great heaps, and not reliably every year.<br><br>So -- I vote "yes" for keeping the perennial crops as one of many food production tools in the wizard's toolkit, with the recognition of and accommodation to their limitations (as is essential for all appropriate tech, of course!)<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c3432117906477062890 title="comment permalink">7/5/10, 7:39 AM</a><br><br>

Mind you, he had some very useful ideas, but I've met a lot of people who piled into geodesic domes with great enthusiasm in the early 70s, but ended up exchanging them for frame-built houses with vertical walls and the quadruple redundancy of shingle roofing once the disadvantages of Fuller's approach became apparent. <br><br>Tom, that's the best possible approach when you've got plenty of people who have practical skills that are useful in a deindustrial world. The problem in most of the US, and many other places as well, is that the vast majority of people are uninterested in picking up such skills, and are relying on one deus ex machina or other to allow them to continue their present lifestyles. Thus green wizards -- who aren't "officials" in any sense of the word, just individuals who take the time to pick up a set of crucial skills that will make life a lot easier in a deindustrializing world, so those skills can be shared with others when the necessity of using them finally sinks in. <br><br>By the way, I've also tasted the waters at Chalice Well, and walked to what used to be Pons Perilis, the Perilous Bridge, and is now Pomparles; I've watched the sun rise over standing stones and walked the old paths over the chalk downs at evening, when the chalk seems to glow from within. And of course you're right about Arthur; I've talked about the relevance of the "Arthurian fact" in <i>The Druidry Handbook</i>, and will probably post something about it here down the road. <br><br>Karen, thank you. I hope you find much of value in your apprenticeship!<br><br>Wordek, ascii over radio is certainly one option; if enough technology remains viable, packet radio might be an option; if things get really hairy, well, there's always CW -- I've pointed out more than once that there's nothing in a simple radio transmitter and receiver that would have been too complex for a medieval Chinese or European alchemist to construct. That's one of the pieces of relatively high tech I would really like to see survive. <br><br>Yeshe, "wizard" is a gender-neutral term -- it literally means "one who is wise," the way "drunkard" means "one who is drunk." So you can be a wizard and a witch at the same time, if you like. <br><br>Patrick/Alchemy, have you considered blogging on the subject? I suspect you'd get an audience. <br><br>Bill, the only problem is those pesky Greenland ice cores, which show that the planet can warm up drastically in a very short time -- 11 to 13 degrees F. in less than a decade at the end of the Younger Dryas cold spell, for example. (I"m not sure why climate scientists are not taking that into consideration.) I agree that it's probably worth trying some perennials -- we've got rhubarb and asparagus in our garden -- but I'm not sure I'd depend on them. <br><br>Cathy, thanks for the book references! I've read Tarnas' work, but not the other. <br><br>Tracy, I've come to think of drop spindles as one of the best examples of resilient technology -- a very simple tool that can integrate with some other very simple tools (for example, a backstrap loom or a vertical blanket loom of the sort at lot of First Nations used) to produce necessary goods. <br><br>Lewis, excellent advice!<br><br>Charlo, that's one approach. It's crucial to remember, though, that the approach that works for you may not be the one that works for others.<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c8987303218312390847 title="comment permalink">7/5/10, 4:02 PM</a><br><br>

There are many widely grown fruit and nut varieties that have a hardiness range of 3-4 USDA zones. <br><br>We might head down into the cold part of a Dryas spell, too, at least in eastern North America, if the thermohaline circuation gets disrupted by ice melt.

I was originally recommended to read your site a month or so back and I’ve just ordered a couple of your books and will keep checking back to see how things develop. <br> <br>Personally I’ve been very concerned about peak oil these last months and I’m also writing up a philosophy master dissertation on climate change this summer. I’m currently then very seriously pondering quitting my safe but dead end office job to spend a year in poverty learning to grow food, living simply/cheaply and acquiring useful skills, before going WWOOF travelling down under and trying to find a good community to join for mutual benefit in some not so densely populated corner of the planet (emigration controls allowing). I think I want to and will try but it’s a bit of a risky, hard and scary prospect compared to living BAU.<br><br>I would like to take up and disagree with your suggestion that annual vegetables would be the best response to climate change. I’m reading an excellent and very detailed new book at the moment called "Creating a Forest Garden: Working with nature to grow edible crops" by Martin Crawford of the Agroforestry Research Trust, which I particularly recommend. He argues that that properly planned forest gardens of perennial plants are the best and most resilient response to climate change, as their soil is kept mostly shaded and in excellent health/quality and the very large number of useful (though not always well known) plants used ensure many will do well even if some fail. Also, though a good Forest Garden takes time and effort to set up in the early years, once they get going little effort or maintenance is required as compared to that of traditional organic gardening/farming – which hopefully allows people a better quality of life.<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c76667513270195182 title="comment permalink">7/5/10, 5:48 PM</a><br><br>

I am personally looking forward to wielding the hammer and stake in the name of green wizardry. Zombie money, you shall not pass! <br><br>Anyway, as I was reading your post, especially the beginning where you mention people's inability to come to grips with the fact that the comforts of the modern industrial age will slowly be cascading into the abyss, I couldn't help but think of the end to C.S. Lewis's The Discarded Image, which I recently finished. While the work focuses on the medieval model of the universe, and how it applies to medieval literature, Lewis's commentary on the nature of models in general in the epilogue might have some use here. Lewis explains that the popularly defined model followed by societies in any era is undoubtedly influenced by what he calls the “temper of mind.” Each model then represents not only an attempt to catalog realities and fantasies, as may be the case, but also the prevalent psychology of that age along with it's prevailing knowledge. For instance, a German in the Middle Ages would have a great deal of difficulty with the notion that the universe is almost entirely composed of vast sections of emptiness; while at the same time, a modern Westerner trained in the methods of the scientific revolution would find the medieval view of the universe equally puzzling and in all likelihood, rather childish. Yet, no model is better than the other, both were born out of a different set of circumstances. <br><br>The issue here is perception. Robert Jarvis's work on perception, and how perceptual lenses influences political decisions comes to mind, as he spoke of how culture, economy, values, religion, and geography influence how we perceive and act in social settings in our daily lives. <br><br>In times of discomfort, pain, and suffering, i think it is easy to fall back upon our deeply rooted perceptions, influenced by the current paradigm or model, to seek the answers for the future. Regardless of the presentation of new facts and ideas, people will cling to what they know and, perhaps more importantly, what they believe in. As Lewis aptly states, hardly any collection of new facts and ideas could have persuaded an ancient Greek that the universe had an attribute so repugnant to him as infinity. Nor would it be easy to convince a modern city-dweller that they could survive in the summer heat without air conditioning. <br><br>In our own era, the pull of the collective, and the altar of capitalism and markets is incredibly strong. Sauron's dark forces in the marketing firms and board rooms work to weave their spell upon a populace that has been led to believe that anything can be fixed by industry or government. Join an organization, vote for me, send money, buy our new gizmo, we promise, all the pain will all go away, really, it will. Our model is very strong indeed, and most importantly it does not promote personal independence of any sort. <br><br>Lewis concludes his book by musing that the modern model may die a violent death, or it may evolve when far-reaching changes in the mental temper of his descendants demand that it should. The thing is, very few people are demanding any change from our current model and state of perception because it is what they have grown up with, and it is incredibly comfortable. Couple this model with the herd-mentality of our species, and you have the perfect recipe for a false notion of resilience that will drive people to seek more of the same.<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c7770681545274990580 title="comment permalink">7/5/10, 8:20 PM</a><br><br>

I think he is just reflecting is unabashed and seemingly irrational hatred for the south and all things associated with it. I'd expect the first shooting wars will be in the west over things like water rights, not in the southeast over hot-button political "wedge issues." <br><br>Criteria we looked at for relocating:<br><br>Remember you are relocating to live there in the present as well as the future. And the future is unknown. So don't use ONLY criteria based on one hypothetical future for your decision. My major criteria were:<br><br>-- Cost of land, and the rate at which it is changing. Rapidly rising land costs indicate impending sprawl; rapidly falling land costs indicate social and economic disruption.<br><br>-- Climate conducive to growing food. This includes being able to own your own water rights, which you often cannot do in the west. In the west I'd likely be breaking the law every time I dip a bucket of water from the creek and pour it on the tomatoes. <br><br>-- Being far enough from major urban centers that suburban sprawl is not likely to swallow you up in the next few decades. Like it or not, sprawl may not yet be a thing of the past. We may endure another round or two of it as people continue trying to jump start the good old days. <br><br>-- Not being so isolated that paid employment is difficult or impossible. In the transition decades, having access to old-fashioned jobs can be really important, even the possibility to reach them via long commutes. It's not the way you want to live forever, but the transition takes a lot longer than you think, and your cash reserves are a lot smaller than you think, so you need this option. <br><br>-- Local culture with a demonstrated acceptance of weirdos and hippy-freaks who move in to the area and start doing strange things on their land. In our county we have an elephant sanctuary, a surviving (flourishing) alternative community from the early 1970s, and a Yoga retreat center. These were all taken as very positive signs by us. <br><br>-- Proximity to our family, especially our elderly mothers who will need (are needing) elder care in the near future (present day). It turns out my mother moved here to join us; this often happens, so be prepared for the possibility!<br><br>-- Lack of major social disfunction, often reflected in crime stats. Rural areas can be surprisingly variable in their crime data, and in my experience this reflects real profound differences in culture. Areas with higher crime rates seem to be more invested in cultures of violence, graft, organized crime (which is RAMPANT in some rural areas) and greater disparities between rich and poor, even on a fairly small geographic scale. For example, these data directed me to look at middle TN, not west TN, which in hindsight has proven to be a very good decision. <br><br>--Finally this is kind of an obscure one, but I looked for areas that had higher natural biodiversity (again, on a fairly small geographic scale). To me this indicates a more complex natural environment with a greater variety of ways for biological things to make a living there, which to me seems like a good sign for a person trying to make a living in the same ecosystem. <br><br>That's how I did it; other people will likely have different priorities but it is really helpful to make them explicit and specific, look up real data, and map things out.<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c4921300128783952989 title="comment permalink">7/6/10, 10:47 AM</a><br><br>

I believe that it is about 15 years old and 2 acres in extent. I haven't visited it - it's not easy to get access and courses cost £150. At the moment I'm reading Fakuoka's 'The One Straw Revolution' that appears to describe a very productive, 'no-till' form of agriculture. BUT when you read the details it relies heavily on a 12 month Japanese growing season that enables wheat/barley straw to mulch rice crops and vice versa. ALSO Fakuoka pelleted his rice seeds in clay, BY HAND. The point that I'm trying to make is that these techniques DO NOT solve all problems at no cost and it is actually very difficult to find out the details of how they work (particularly the labour involved). I've just read Holmgren's 'Permaculture' book and you do get the impression that he can't quite understand why our ancestors came out of the forest and took to ploughing the fields. But at a deeper level you maybe get the feeling that he hasn't experienced the vigour of a near-artic spring and doesn't appreciate how well cereals are adapted to compete at high latitudes. <br>I'd also note that the county of Devon, which has the HQ of the Agroforestry Research Trust has 33,000 miles of hedges in its fields. That represents an awful lot of 'traditional Agroforestry' and many hedges are documented back over 500 years and provided nut, berries, building materials, fuel, tool handles etc.. I <br>think that there are too many people around wanting to sell theories and unfortunately even more people who are persuaded to uncritically buy them. Not only that, but they go around waving their favourite books at you and not listening to any criticisms.(Having said that, there may be some very good ideas at the Agroforestry Research Centre - just have better things to do with £150....)<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c5449891870980237153 title="comment permalink">7/6/10, 10:50 AM</a><br><br>

They are not based on fruit, nuts, leafy greens, nightshades, unripe legumes, all the things most home gardeners and hobby orchardists focus on. Yet most people now, even avid gardeners, have never grown one of these crops. Sweet corn does not count; that's a specialty vegetable. Try growing field corn, grinding the meal or making the hominy, and then cooking with it. Who even knows the difference between flint and dent corn anymore? Or hard and soft wheat? <br><br>I'm sure you will include this in your curriculum, but I'd urge anyone who has any thoughts of really growing a diet, not just a side dish, get experience with growing field crops even on a small scale. Carla Emery's book is a very good guide for getting started. Mark off a 20x20' plot, and tend some grains and some beans by hand, no rototiller, and see what it is like. You may be surprised to discover that (a) yes, a single person WOULD be able grow a full year's supply of these crops on her own, by hand, no fuel, no horse, no ox but (b) it is a lot of dirty sweaty work, there is no way around that without energy slaves.<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c6843593397925806552 title="comment permalink">7/6/10, 12:21 PM</a><br><br>

I'm a firm believer that having the ability to recognize those who carry much empirical wisdom, and further the ability to listen, will get one much further than reading or research, and so it's with that in mind that I ask this question here. <br>This is my third year gardening, and my second year utilizing all organic methods (more hoping than skill I might add). I have an approximately 600 square foot vegetable garden. Most of my knowledge comes from Steve Solomon's "Gardening When it Counts." So I have practiced low intensity gardening, basically placing plants as far apart as possible. <br>This coming weekend I'm renting a backhoe and clearing out about an acre of my land so that I can grow some grains, corn, taters, and beans. My goal is to grow as much of my families diet as possible (my wife and a newborn Ayden Zen). I don't know anything about forest gardening and I don't want to make a mistake by clearing the land to grow some food if there is another way. I have two oak trees that are over 100 years old, one on the east side and one on the west side of my property. My little 600 square feet is the only place my property gets 6 hours of sunlight. The only way that I know to expand my growing capabilities is to do what I'm going to do, open up more land to the sun. <br>I also need the land to make room for a greenhouse that I'm building by using double paned sliding glass doors that I have acquired for free through an uncle. He is bringing six 4' by 6' sliding glass doors. I have an idea of orienting this thing to the sun in such a way that I can just have a glass front made out of 4 of the glass doors and then put two on each side. We are going to use old windows for the roof. <br>Basically my question is is there another way other than clearing the woods out? Also what is the best way to orient the greenhouse in relation to the sun. I've read that south facing is better for capturing heat for passive solar heating. My wife, who is a photographer, says that in photography you want north facing windows for light. Forgive my ignorance, but I'm doing this clearing and construction this weekend. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c7906208571075920424 title="comment permalink">7/6/10, 2:15 PM</a><br><br>

Do something useful with the wood, so it won't be wasted, and plant some trees on another portion of your property to right the balance. You're right about the orientation of the greenhouse; if you're in the northern hemisphere, you want a southern exposure.

When a civilization begins to decline, one sign is that the relationship between the civilization and its external proletariats becomes increasingly hostile, and eventually leads to insurgency and/or open war.

If blight is endemic in your area, make the expense to purchase seed potatoes. They are expensive, but you are much more likely to get a crop than if you save infected seed. Crop rotation helps a lot with this, making sure never to plant potatoes in soil that in the last 2 years has had potatoes, tomatoes, tomatilloes, husk cherries, or hoe nightshade (a pervasive weed of the Western US that I struggle against every year).

Basically it was 2 groups of men trying to achieve opposite ends by the same means. Christian monks are trying to perfect themselves, Buddhist monks are trying to negate themselves. While the means were identical (self-mastery, abolition of desire, disciplined life in a community) the endpoint was very different indeed.<br><br>Also, Christian clerics are supposed to be an <i>alter Christus</i> another Christ. This demands non-violence, as He gave himself over to his persecutors rather than defend Himself, even with words, let alone violence. Hence it is forbidden for Christian clerics to draw blood, and it is considered a sin to strike them.<br><br>So however much mental and volitional discipline can be learned within a martial art, that path is contrary to the nature of a Western monastic.<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c3370522198592122803 title="comment permalink">7/7/10, 1:30 PM</a><br><br>

Save a bottle for me. <br><br>Ruben, thanks for the links! These are good. <br><br>Timewalker, you're reminding me of a passage from the Mabinogion. <br><br>Chris, as time permits. <br><br>Michael, if you want to try to bring something like that into existence, great; go for it. If you want somebody else to do it, well, let's just say you may be waiting for a long time. One of the lessons of this moment in history is that actions are more valuable than ideas. <br><br>Loveandlight, my experience is that this isn't the sort of thing you can communicate in a single post, because you have to walk the person through the places where today's conventional wisdom fails to deal with ecological reality. That takes time and patience. My book <i>The Long Descent</i> is about as concise as I've been able to make a written version of the process. <br><br>Danby, if as devout and conservative a Catholic as J.R.R. Tolkien could find wizards congenial company, I don't think you have anything to worry about! As for western monasticism, though, there were the militant orders of the Middle Ages -- the Templars, Hospitallers, and so on, who did combine life under a Christian monastic rule with the profession of the warrior. Since I'm not a Christian I'll leave it to those who are to debate whether that was appropriate, but it did happen.<br><br><a href=merlins-time.html#c6828346023161485422 title="comment permalink">7/7/10, 2:36 PM</a><br><br>
