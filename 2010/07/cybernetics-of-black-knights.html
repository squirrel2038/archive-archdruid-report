Serendipity’s a funny thing. When I started planning out this post a couple of days ago, I knew that I was going to have to pull my battered copy of Gregory Bateson’s <i>Mind and Nature</i> off the bookshelf where I keep basic texts on systems philosophy, since it’s almost impossible to talk about information in any useful way without banking off Bateson’s ideas. I didn’t have any similar intention when I checked out science reporter Charles Seife’s <i>Sun in a Bottle: The Strange History of Fusion and the Science of Wishful Thinking</i> from the local library, much less when I took a break from writing the other evening to watch “Monty Python and the Holy Grail” for the first time since my teens.<br><br>Still, I’m not at all sure I could have chosen better, for both of these latter turned out to have plenty of relevance to the theme of this week’s post. Fifty years of failed research and a minor masterpiece of giddy British absurdity may not seem to have much to do with each other, much less with information, Gregory Bateson, or a “green wizardry” fitted to the hard limits and pressing needs of the end of the industrial age. Yet the connections are there, and the process of tracing them out will help more than a little to make sense of how information works – and also how it fails to work.<br><br>Let’s start with a few basics. Information is the third element of the triad of fundamental principles that flow through whole systems of every kind, and thus need to be understood to build viable appropriate tech systems. We have at least one huge advantage in understanding information that people a century ago didn’t have: a science of information flow in whole systems, variously called cybernetics and systems theory, that was one of the great intellectual adventures of the twentieth century and deserves much more attention than most people give it these days.<br><br>Unfortunately we also have at least one huge disadvantage in understanding information that people a century ago didn’t have, either. The practical achievements of cybernetics, especially but not only in the field of computer science, have given rise to attitudes toward information in popular culture that impose bizarre distortions on the way most people nowadays approach the subject. You can see these attitudes in an extreme form in the notion, common in some avant-garde circles, that since the amount of information available to industrial civilization is supposedly increasing at an exponential rate, and exponential curves approach infinity asymptotically in a finite time, then at some point not too far in the future, industrial humanity will know everything and achieve something like omnipotence.<br><br>I’ve pointed out several times in these essays that this faith in the so-called “singularity” is a rehash of Christian apocalyptic myth in the language of cheap science fiction, complete with a techno-Rapture into a heaven lightly redecorated to make it look like outer space. It might also make a good exhibit A in a discussion of the way that any exponential curve taken far enough results in absurdity. Still, there’s still another point here, which is that the entire notion of the singularity is rooted in a fundamental misunderstanding of what information is and what it does.<br><br>Bateson’s work is a good place to start clearing up the mess. He defines information as “a difference that makes a difference.” This is a subtle definition, and it implies much more than it states. Notice in particular that whether a difference “makes a difference” is not an objective quality ; it depends on an observer, to whom the difference makes a difference. To make the same point in the language of philosophy, information can’t be separated from intentionality.<br><br>What is intentionality? The easiest way to understand this concept is to turn toward the nearest window. Notice that you can look <i>through</i> the window and see what’s beyond it, or you can look <i>at</i> the window and see the window itself. If you want to know what’s happening in the street outside, you look through the window; if you want to know how dirty the window glass is, you look at the window. The window presents you with the same collection of photons in either case; what turns that collection into information of one kind or another, and makes the difference between seeing the street and seeing the glass, is your intentionality.<br><br>The torrent of raw difference that deluges every human being during every waking second, in other words, is not information. That torrent is data – a Latin word that means “that which is given.” Only when we approach data with intentionality, looking for differences that make a difference, does data become information – another Latin word that means “that which puts form into something.” Data that isn’t relevant to a given intentionality, such as the dirt on a window when you’re trying to see what’s outside, has a different name, one that doesn’t come from Latin: noise.<br><br>Thus the mass production of data in which believers in the singularity place their hope of salvation can very easily have the opposite of the effect they claim for it. Information only comes into being when data is approached from within a given intentionality, so it’s nonsense to speak of it as increasing exponentially in some objective sense. Data can increase exponentially, to be sure, but this simply increases the amount of noise that has to be filtered before information can be made from it. This is particularly true in that a very large fraction of the data that’s exponentially increasing these days consists of such important material as, say, gossip about Kate Hudson’s breast implants.<br><br>The need to keep data within bounds to make getting information from it easier explains why the sense organs of living things have been shaped by evolution to restrict, often very sharply, the data they accept. Every species of animal has different information needs, and thus limits its intake of data in a different way. You’re descended from mammals that spent a long time living in trees, for example, which is why your visual system is very good at depth perception and seeing the colors that differentiate ripe from unripe fruit, and very poor at a lot of other things.<br><br>A honeybee has different needs for information, and so its senses select different data. It sees colors well up into the ultraviolet, which you can’t, because many flowers use reflectivity in the ultraviolet to signal where the nectar is, and it also sees the polarization angle of light, which you don’t, since this helps it navigate to and from the hive. You don’t “see” heat with a special organ on your face, the way a rattlesnake does, or sense electrical currents the way many fish do; around you at every moment is a world of data that you will never perceive, because your ancestors over millions of generations survived better by excluding that data, so they could extract information from the remainder, than they would have done by including it.<br><br>Human social evolution parallels biological evolution, and so it’s not surprising that much of the data processing in human societies consists of excluding most data so that useful information can emerge from the little that’s left over. This is necessary but it’s also problematic, for a set of filters that limit data to what’s useful in one historical or ecological context can screen out exactly the data that might be most useful in a different context, and the filters don’t necessarily change as fast as the context.<br><br>The history of fusion power research provides a superb example. For more than half a century now, leading scientists in the world’s industrial nations have insisted repeatedly, and inaccurately, that they were on the brink of opening the door to commercially viable fusion power. Trillions of dollars have gone down what might best be described as a collection of high-tech ratholes as the same handful of devices get rebuilt in bigger and fancier models, and result in bigger and costlier flops. They’re still at it; the money the US government alone is paying to fund the two fusion megaprojects du jour, the National Ignition Facility and the ITER, would very likely buy a solar hot water system for every residence in the United States and thus cut the country’s household energy use by around 10% at a single stroke. Instead, it’s being spent on projects that even their most enthusiastic proponents admit will only be one more inconclusive step toward fusion power.<br><br>The information that is being missed here is that fusion power isn’t a viable option. Even if sustained fusion can be done at all outside the heart of a star, and the odds of that don’t look good just now, it’s been shown beyond a doubt that the cost of building enough fusion power plants to make a difference will be so high that no nation on Earth can afford them. There are plenty of reasons why that information is being missed, but an important one is that industrial society learned a long time ago to filter out data that suggested that any given technology wasn’t going to be viable. During the last three centuries, as fossil fuel extraction sent energy per capita soaring to unparalleled heights, that was an adaptive choice; the inevitable failures – and there have been wowsers – were more than outweighed by the long shots that came off, and the steady expansion of economic wealth powered by fossil fuels made covering the costs of failures and long shots alike a minor matter.<br><br>We don’t live in that kind of world any longer. With the peak of world conventional petroleum production receding in the rear view mirror, energy per capita is contracting, not expanding. At the same time, most of the low hanging fruit in science and engineering has long since been harvested, and most of what’s left – fusion power here again is a good example – demands investment on a gargantuan scale with no certainty of payback. The assumption that innovation always pays off, and that data contradicting that belief is to be excluded, has become hopelessly maladaptive, but it remains welded in place; consider the number of people who insist that the proper response to peak oil is some massive program that would gamble the future on some technology that hasn’t yet left the drawing boards.<br><br>It’s at this point that the sound of clattering coconut hulls can be heard in the distance, for the attempt to create information out of data that won’t fit it is the essence of the absurd, and absurdity was the stock in trade of the crew of British comics who performed under the banner of Monty Python. What makes “Monty Python and the Holy Grail” so funny is the head-on collisions between intentionalities and data deliberately chosen to conflict with them; any given collision may involve the intentionality the audience has been lured into accepting, or the intentionality one of the characters is pursuing, or both at once, but in every scene, cybernetically speaking, that’s what’s happening.<br><br>Consider King Arthur’s encounter with the Black Knight. The audience and Arthur both approach the scene with an intentionality borrowed from chivalric romance, in which knightly combat extracts the information of who wins and who loses out of the background data of combat. The Black Knight, by contrast, approaches the fight with an intentionality that excludes any data that would signal his defeat. No matter how many of the Black Knight’s limbs get chopped off – and by the end of the scene, he’s got four bloody stumps – he insists on his invincibility and accuses Arthur of cowardice for refusing to continue the fight. There’s some resemblance here to the community of fusion researchers, whose unchanging response to half a century of utter failure is to keep repeating that fusion power is just twenty (more) years in the future.<br><br>Doubtless believers in the singularity will be saying much the same thing fifty years from now, if there are still any believers in the singularity around then. The simple logical mistake they’re making is the same one that fusion researchers have been making for half a century; they’ve forgotten that the words “this can’t be done” also convey information, and a very important kind of information at that. Just as it’s very likely at this point that fusion research will end up discovering that fusion power won’t work on any scale smaller than a star, it’s entirely plausible that even if we did achieve infinite knowledge about the nature of the universe, what we would learn from it is that the science fiction fantasies retailed by believers in the singularity are permanently out of reach, and we simply have to grit our teeth and accept the realities of human existence after all.<br><br>All these points, even those involving Black Knights, have to be kept in mind in making sense of the flow of information through whole systems. Every system has its own intentionality, and every functional system filters the data given to it so that it can create the information it needs. Even so simple a system as a thermostat connected to a furnace has an intentionality – it “looks” at the air temperature around the thermostat, and “sees” if that temperature is low enough to justify turning the furnace on, or high enough to justify turning it off. The better the thermostat, the more completely it ignores any data that has no bearing on its intentionality; conversely, most of the faults thermostats can suffer can be understood as ways that other bits of data (for example, the insulating value of the layer of dust on the thermostat) insert themselves where they’re not wanted.<br><br>The function of the thermostat-furnace system in the larger system to which it belongs – the system of the house that it’s supposed to keep at a more or less stable temperature – is another matter, and requires a subtly different intentionality. The homeowner, whose job it is to make information out of the available data, monitors the behavior of the thermostat-furnace system and, if something goes wrong, has to figure out where the trouble is and fix it. The thermostat-furnace system’s intentionality is to turn certain ranges of air temperature, as perceived by the thermostat, into certain actions performed by the furnace; the homeowner’s intentionality is to make sure that this intentionality produces the effect that it’s supposed to produce.<br><br>One way or another, this same two-level system plays a role in every part of the green wizard’s work. It’s possible to put additional levels between the system on the spot (in the example, the thermostat-furnace system) and the human being who manages the system, but in appropriate tech it’s rarely a good option; the Jetsons fantasy of the house that runs itself is one of the things most worth jettisoning as the age of cheap energy comes to a close. Your goal in crafting systems is to come up with stable, reliable systems that will pursue their own intentionalities without your interference most of the time, while you monitor the overall output of the system and keep tabs on the very small range of data that will let you know if something has gone haywire.<br><br>That same two-level system also applies, interestingly enough, to the process of learning to become a green wizard. The material on appropriate technology I’ve asked readers to collect embodies a wealth of data; what prospective green wizards have to do, in turn, is to decide on their own intentionality toward the data they have, and begin turning it into information. This is the exercise for this week.<br><br>Here’s how it works. Go through the Master Conserver files you downloaded, and any appropriate tech books you’ve been able to collect. On a sheet of paper, or perhaps in a notebook, note down each project you encounter – for example, weatherstripping your windows, or building a solar greenhouse. Mark any of the projects you’ve already done with a check mark. Then mark each of the projects you haven’t done with one of four numbers and one of four letters: <br><br>1 – this is a project that you could do easily with the resources available to you.<br>2 – this is a project that you could do, though it would take some effort to get the resources.<br>3 – this is a project that you could do if you really had to, but it would be a serious challenge.<br>4 – this is a project that, for one reason or another, is out of reach for you.<br><br>A – this is a project that is immediately and obviously useful in your life and situation right now.<br>B – this is a project that could be useful to you given certain changes in your life and situation.<br>C – this is a project that might be useful if your life and situation were to change drastically.<br>D – this is a project that, for one reason for another, is useless or irrelevant to you.<br><br>This exercise will produce a very rough and general intentionality, to be sure, but you’ll find it tolerably easy to refine from there. Once you decide, let’s say, that weatherstripping the leaky windows of your apartment before winter arrives is a 1-A project – easy as well as immediately useful – you’ve set up an intentionality that allows you to winnow through a great deal of data and find the information you need: for example, what kinds of weatherstripping are available at the local hardware store, and which of those can you use without spending a lot of money or annoying your landlord. Once you decide that building a brand new ecovillage in the middle of nowhere is a 4-D project, equally, you can set aside data relevant to that project and pay attention to things that matter.<br><br>Of course you’re going to find 1-D and 4-A projects as well – things that are possible but irrelevant, and things that would be splendidly useful but are out of your reach. Recognizing these limits is part of the goal of the exercise; learning to focus your efforts where they will accomplish the most soonest is another part; recognizing that you’ll be going back over these lists later on, as you learn more, and potentially changing your mind about some of the rankings, is yet another. Give it a try, and see where it takes you.

I think an asymptote is by definition a finite number, not infinity. And you approach an asymptote at an ever diminishing rate. However close you need to get to the asymptote, there is a finite time at which you will achieve this. Exponentials approach infinity at an ever increasing rate. It is meaningless to say how "far" they are from infinity, as all finite numbers are equally far from infinity (in the same way that there are precisely as many real numbers between 0 and 1 as there are between 1 and 1,000,000 since the two sets can be mapped onto each other with complete 1:1 correspondence). For the non-mathematicians, yes, I know, that makes no sense. But infinity is by its very definition incomprehensible to common sense. Of course, exponential decay does approach zero asymptotically. <br><br>This has no bearing on your logic and your points, of course. But ya still oughta get yer terms right.<br><br><a href=cybernetics-of-black-knights.html#c407376790227017170 title="comment permalink">7/28/10, 8:21 PM</a><br><br>

When they effectively reach that point they become irrelevant. Something will happen that will make them become either ubiquitous or disappear.

Often what seems like a 3A can be decomposed into a bunch of 1s and 2s which are somewhat independent and separable. When you are confronted with a 3A type task (very useful, a whole lot of work), the only way you will likely ever get around to it is to approach it one step at a time. Otherwise you will be overwhelmed. This is part of the extraction of information from the noise. To stick with the window metaphor, you have to chose whether your intent will be to clean the window or weed the garden or prune the apple tree or paint the window casing. You can look at the weedy garden and scraggly apple tree through the dirty window with peeling paint on the casing, and just start weeping and go back to bed (or, in the case of most country boys, just go fishin'). Or you can just focus on one of the above, go get the tools, and not think about the others until you have finished the one you picked. And then go fishin'. The rest can wait 'til tomorrow.<br><br><a href=cybernetics-of-black-knights.html#c8973130597816872956 title="comment permalink">7/28/10, 8:43 PM</a><br><br>

An interesting comparison; I'll have to brush up on my Buddhist theory to follow it, but it should be interesting. <br><br>DIYer, whether information persists or propagates depends on the frequency with which a given intentionality occurs within a population. The challenge, and it's a steep one, is to find a way to take a step back, and perceive one's own intentionality as information; that's what the scientific method does, when it works, and in another context that's also what meditation does. <br><br>Bill, as I said to Anton, I'm just repeating the jargon that was repeated to me. I don't claim to be a mathematician -- the sort of slide rule math needed to calculate the resonant frequency of a circuit is about the upper end of my number crunching skills -- and if you're saying that the argument made to me was nonsense, well, I promise not to faint with surprise. <br><br>Miltonics, good. That's the point I wanted to make by suggesting that every exponential curve, taken far enough, approaches absurdity. <br><br>Alan, by all means!<br><br>Bill, your crystal ball is working again, I see.

Sorry, I'm being an editor here... <br><br>I gather what someone meant when they said "approach infinity asymptotically" was that given enough time it will eventually achieve any height you can imagine (the same is true for linear growth too, it just takes longer.) But exponential growth does not "approach infinity," as infinity always stays infinitely far away (unlike what happens to 1/x as x approaches zero; that really does reach infinity at a finite point). <br><br>A more mathematically correct statement might sound something like that exponential growth climbs at an ever increasing rate, or (to be cute) that its rate of acceleration is itself rapidly accelerating, or something similar, and can reach very high levels rather quickly. Just leave out "asymptote" and "infinity," neither of which applies. <br><br>Completely digressing, more fun with infinity:<br><br>There are infinitely many points on a line -- the same infinite number regardless of how long the line is. There are infinitely more points in a square than there are points on a line; the number of points in a finite square is the same as the number of points on an infinite line. There are in fact infinitely many infinities as you increase the number of dimensions you can put your points in -- each of these successive infinities is infinitely larger than the one that precedes it. But which infinity is the number of infinities? <br><br>Who said math was dull...?<br><br>And if an infinite number of angels can dance on the head of a pin, WHICH infinity are we talking about???<br><br><a href=cybernetics-of-black-knights.html#c1159541347821874757 title="comment permalink">7/28/10, 11:06 PM</a><br><br>

What a crazy idea and they were actually serious. It never occurred to the person suggesting the comment that a ham radio operator could get far more information across using either voice or even morse code.

Western culture has become lazy in that they apply technological solutions to simple problems. It's an addiction that you have explained very eloquently. <br><br>Take for example heat, which is a problem here over summer. What do you do? The normal solution around here is to install a split system reverse cycle air conditioner and don't worry about the rest of the house siting or structure. It is common for houses to have more than one system. You don't have to think about the problem anymore, until the energy supplies become restricted or even cut off.

The way it was explained to me, the singularity depends on the idea that the sum total of information becomes infinite in a finite (and not too very long) time. As for angels on the head of a pin, you do know the point to the debate, I trust? It was whether the number was infinite or finite, and thus -- the point really at issue -- whether angels occupy physical space or are entirely noumenal realities. From within the intentionality of medieval scholastic philosophy, it's far from an irrelevant question. <br><br>Librarian, thank you. Please do start the League of Doomer Librarians -- a blog might be a good way to launch it; my guess, based on the number of people in the library field who've interacted with me around these issues, is that you'd get a lot more interest than you might suspect. <br><br>Risa, good. Thanks for the reference!<br><br>Phil, the "bubble" metaphor works so long as all the people you're discussing have a general intentionality in common -- in terms of the metaphor, they're all trying to observe cars on the street, even if the cars they're watching are different makes and models. It's when that's not true that information becomes a much more complex thing. <br><br>Cherokee, CW (morse code) is an astonishingly fast and effective way of conveying information; every so often there's a contest between a couple of old ham operators and a couple of kids with text messaging, to see who can get a given message across fastest and with the least distortion, and the hams win every time. It's also technically the simplest way to modulate a radio wave in order to carry information, thus sustainable even in a setting of limited tech resources. All of which is to say that you're quite right; packet radio (internet over the air) may well be a useful transitional tool, at least while used computers are available, but moving toward simpler means for information transfer, summertime cooling, etc. is the winning bet. <br><br>Edde, at the moment it's more the "Wring Out The Dripping Atmosphere" moon! Your point about simplicity -- well, my experience is that this is impossible to teach to anybody who hasn't already learned it. Most people are entranced by stuff, and always have been; Lao Tsu's comments on the subject come to mind. Which is to say that you're quite right, and it would be helpful if more people noticed that the more stuff you have, the harder you have to work to maintain, fuel, clean, etc., etc. it -- but that's apparently a hugely difficult realization for our species.<br><br><a href=cybernetics-of-black-knights.html#c2912779458026704223 title="comment permalink">7/29/10, 5:40 AM</a><br><br>

After digestion, it got me thinking <br>about a rethorical trick that is directly relevant to the handling of <br>"information" discussed here: Metaphors. <br><br>Metaphors, comparisons, are very handy pedagogical tools. By offering<br>an image that is already known and grasped, they allow sieve useful <br>information out of a flux of data that would otherwise have been <br>overhelming. This is especially useful when the flow of data is <br>produced by someone trying to convey a complex piece of information. <br><br>There is a danger though: it is to mistake the metaphor for the thing <br>being described. Because a metaphor is by nature *not the thing*, It <br>will ALWAYS end up wrong. <br><br>That's where the subtle track lies. A good metaphor, is a metaphor <br>that works well and that is beautiful. This means that it corresponds <br>to a mental shape that feels comfortable. But exactly because of this, <br>metaphors can end up filtering every bit of data that doesn't fit with <br>the methaphoric image. That's when one gets entrhalled by the <br>methaphor. Because it is then so tempting to follow the image, that <br>suits so well our internal description of the world, instead of going <br>through the painful tedious extraction of information out of data. <br><br>Let's now build an image of the person making this quote about <br>exponential. He built this "exponential with moustache" picture that <br>gave him a good feeling about a fast and faster growth. He mixed it <br>with an image of what an asymptote might be. This "exponential with <br>moustache" ended up being a sieve that filtered out all the <br>mathematical "data", only keeping the "information" that suited the <br>internal coherence of this personal image about what an exponential is. <br><br>Take this "exponential with moustaches", apply it to sieve data about <br>technological progress, And voilà, as you say in the US. A beautiful <br>metaphor of growth of knowledge. Sadly, (I can tell now that I know <br>JMG won't faint), an utterly wrong one. <br><br>I don't know if this "he" created above is more than just an image, <br>but what I know is that I find myself falling in the metaphor trap, <br>and that I have seen tons of people at vulgarization conferences <br>swimming happily in such worlds. I find trying to find examples when <br>metaphor replaces rational thinking for me a very interesting <br>exercise. If you have time to kill waiting for the bus, give it a <br>try. It is fun, and a bit frightening. Because it happens much more than we think. <br><br>Few last words on an other metaphor that was poorly used in this <br>quote: the "Singularity". Singularity in physics is when the <br>matematical model used leads to nonsense. Nonsense is when the <br>matematical formula leads to infinity within the bounds of the system <br>described. Then the model breaks down. <br><br>Any law that yields a singularity should be considered carefully: <br>infinity won't be reached. Never. No, not "even if...". <br><br>Therefore, in between the region where the law of very fast knowledge <br>increase describes the world correctly, and the region where it <br>reaches the vertical asymptote, something *in the model* is wrong. <br><br>To conclude on that, a picture shown in The Economist, that, based on <br>extrapolation, shows that very soon the Earth will be covered with razor blades: <br>http://andyduffell.com/techblog/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/CST393.gif <br><br>Sebzefrog at hotmail.fr<br><br><a href=cybernetics-of-black-knights.html#c6228944552258115360 title="comment permalink">7/29/10, 6:00 AM</a><br><br>

That's why I was accepting them as occupying no space, and asking if the number is infinite, then which infinity are we talking about??<br><br>Ok to the singularity. I suspect the concept as you just outlined it is in fact what people believe, as this would explain why they chose the word "singularity" for it. That has always confused me; now I understand it confuses me because it is just plain wrong. The idea is that information breeds its own growth, like bacteria in a culture medium or neutrons in a nuclear reactor. This autocatalytic process gives you exponential growth -- which means that if it takes the thing x seconds to double, then in the next x seconds it will double again, etc. like compound interest. Autocatalytic, exponential growth is a very common phenomenon in the universe. It does not produce singularities.<br><br>A singularity is a point on a graph where the function breaks down, usually because it shot up or down to positive or negative infinity. The classic example is the graph of the equation y = 1/x. As x approaches zero, the value of y shoots rapidly off the chart no matter how big you make the chart. reaching y=infinity at x=0. The exponential curve, in contrast is smooth and without singularities from the beginning of time until the end. You can leave your money in the bank at compound interest for as long as you like and with as high an interest rate as you can imagine, and it will never become infinite. <br><br>Singularities are exceedingly rare in the real world. The only example I can think of is the black hole, which reaches infinite density and zero volume, causing a singularity in the space-time curves. Exponential growth does lead to catastrophes, as physical or biological properties are pushed beyond tolerance limits. When the atom bomb explodes or the bacterial culture collapses, these were not singularities. The atom bomb's exponential growth in temperature reaches the point that it is so hot it blows itself and anything nearby to smitherenes. The bacterial culture's exponential growth exhausts its culture medium and accumulates so many toxic waste products that the bugs all starve and/or are poisoned to death. No singularity in either case, just an ordinary physical or biochemical breakdown. <br><br>So.. the exponential growth of information will never lead to a singularity, and anyone who claims otherwise needs to review Algebra I. It's another example of the shamefully low level of math skills even among many high-level computer/information geeks. The exponential growth of "information" (data), if not curtailed by other forces, will probably lead to an "information" (data) catastrophe -- Toeffler's information overload on a global scale. My guess is that this would be the point at which in fact no meaningful information can be extracted from the data stream because it has grown too big and too fast -- kaboom, the A-bomb explodes. <br><br>But of course something else will intervene. Exponential growth leading to kaboom is also rare in the world, since nothing exists in isolation. Other limiting factors almost always put the breaks on the process, causing smaller mishaps and little kabooms instead of one really big one. In the information case, of course, it'll doubtless be the slowdown in cheap energy and the resulting economic disruptions and downturns that will throttle back the data stream. No matter what these people think, the data boom is a subset of, not the primary driver of, the cheap-energy-fueled industrial boom.<br><br><a href=cybernetics-of-black-knights.html#c4642291413484685859 title="comment permalink">7/29/10, 7:53 AM</a><br><br>

You touch on several topics that have gotten under my skin lately, as I wonder how my friends and others don’t seem to be able to figure this out– 1) why would some human want to give the computers of the “singularity” the awesome power of being the only things that knew what was going on? (I know some humans think they will become the computer, but they haven’t thought that one through enough)… it reminds me of the British show “Upstairs, Downstairs” where the rich were hopelessly dependent on their servants, and infantilized by that – I often wondered why they thought that was “superiority”. 2)The fact that more data is sweeping us daily seems to immediately suggest we have to restrict the flow or improve our filters – yet folks seem to have filtered out the critical stuff and focused on the trivial! I suspect is that they hate to dwell on their helplessness to stop 3)which is people siphoning money to pet projects that make them a healthy living (like the fusion stuff) whether or not there is an overall benefit. When I worked in hi-tech, I used to think it was nuts that the engineers were supposed to “invent” things on schedule – that is a contradiction in terms! If it’s something not invented yet, there is no guarantee that it can be – and yet they were creating timelines as if all they had to do was pluck the info from the ether. <br><br>The reverse of the info-overload is the important fact that if you don’t get the information, you can’t use it! I saw the power of the media back in the 70’s – if they didn’t report it, basically it hadn’t happened for most of the world! That has somewhat changed with the internet, but is still true – because now you have to page through tons of irrelevant info (from biased search engines) to find the useable information. I saw during the recent pandemic that many media were trying to cover “the good news” rather than the actual data, and so it was just as difficult to find out what was really going on.<br><br>I love your description of how absurdity works – I wondered why I was so drawn to it (not only the Pythons, but their radio predecessors The Goon Show,– who are on YouTube, also – and Fry/Laurie and other wonderful comedians). Now I see that I am fascinated by the collision of fact and intention, and the wonderful ability to pour nonsense into a pattern shell, revealing the silliness of the sloppy thinkers. ("It's only a flesh wound...")<br><br>Thank you for the homework assignment. I had already done that mentally – I’m always looking for ways to improve the “homestead”, but needing to holdit up to the limits of my time/energy/money. But writing it down means I don’t have to risk losing that mental work, so I’ll get right on it.<br><br>@Bill <i>You can look at the weedy garden and scraggly apple tree through the dirty window with peeling paint on the casing, and just start weeping and go back to bed </i> Yes – your description of chores is my daily struggle! (And you forgot to add: “spend time reading JMG and responding!) My motto is, “Every day, do a little more… and every day, you’ll get further behind!” ;-}<br><br><br>@DIY <i>I would submit that one critical characteristic of information is that it tends to persist/propagate.</i><br>- what does that say about urban myths, then?<br><br>@Bill <i>Just leave out "asymptote" and "infinity," neither of which applies.</i> Unfortunately, I suspect that was the point of the singularists – they love the idea that suddenly their information overload will turn into something magical (not in JMG’s sense!) and “eternal” – it’s more of the religious overtones that JMG mentions… from what I read of the singularists, it is “the point” not beside the point… but then, they are spouting nonsense…<br><br><a href=cybernetics-of-black-knights.html#c9144365341172441030 title="comment permalink">7/29/10, 7:57 AM</a><br><br>

As far as I know, Bohm and his collaborator (Basil J. Hiley) coined the term "active information", as opposed to "passive information", which is just the information/data distinction you are making here. He said information is that which "in-forms", also making use of the Latin etymology. In Bohm's case, he is referring to the wave/particle paradox and how there is, in fact, no paradox. The physics is too deep to go into here, but, briefly, he posited that the whole universe is wholly interconnected by a quantum field, a field whose major feature is that it conveys "active information" to particles, which then are "in-formed" by that information, meaning they <i>act themselves</i> (as opposed to being acted upon, as with classical fields) in response to that information.<br><br>I think the connection of the micro to the macro is fascinating.<br><br><a href=cybernetics-of-black-knights.html#c7594605290986600492 title="comment permalink">7/29/10, 9:52 AM</a><br><br>

And, as a consequence of being uncontrolled, it's of no use, except of course, in destroying things in the fireball and shock waves of a thermonuclear detonation.<br><br>But, since we already have a technology that can perform "fusion", the general layman thinks<br>(and is programmed to think by enthusiastic advocates) that with a few tweaks here and there, we can figure out a way to "control" this power. After all, we did it with fission, so why can't we do it with fusion?<br><br>I think people never actually sit down intentionally (as you've asked us to do this week), and consider the "this cannot be done" meme. They look at the progress that has been accomplished and are not content with that. Instead, they look for ways to further progress along the path, never stopping to consider if they are on the correct path in the first place!<br><br>Aided by scientific illiteracy, bombarded by media, and somewhat enraptured by the progress that has been made to date, our species invests a great deal of our effort in continuing the status quo BAU. I know that I certainly subscribe to the "there must be a way to make this work!" meme far more often than I stop and consider "nope, just cannot do it". In my case (Library IT Manager) much of that is job pressure (and job security ;-) but I think this is very indicative of society as a whole.<br><br>As a non-physicist I don't know whether controlled fusion can ever be made to work.

As you know (but not everyone else reading does), it begins with near-exponential growth at rate r, then asymptotically approaches a plateau at K. Real curves fir real natural processes, biological or physical, are rarely so tidy. The temperature in a critical mass of Uranium is not sigmoid, it's approximately exponential up to the point that it melts or explodes, then it suddenly goes in another direction. The population curve for an organism colonizing a new resource is more of a bell shape, near exponential growth, then an inflection point, then a maximum, then a decline that can take a whole bunch of shapes. ALL simple descriptions of natural processes are crude approximations to what we really find. <br><br>The bigger point, of course, is that trajectories of things in the future are rarely simple and easy to predict!<br><br><a href=cybernetics-of-black-knights.html#c698931749637806938 title="comment permalink">7/29/10, 4:47 PM</a><br><br>

It is of course impolite to mention of this vaporware, as I remember, that the energy we collected would be via neutrons emitted which creates low level nuclear waste of the surrounding equipment.<br><br>Later, I attended the meeting of the American Chemical Society where the first paper on cold fusion was given. Curiously, I was kind of busy at the time and forgot to attend the seminar.

Recently, I was hosting a Transition table at a local major environmental festival. Helping me man the booth was a very bright high school student who was obviously very interested and active in environmental issues.

I don't think it was just the end of the cold war, though; the debasement of science goes back well into the 20th century. Me, I'd like to see more people practicing science the way it was done in the 18th and 19th centuries, as a part time avocation; if that were more common we'd be at much less risk of losing the scientific method and the more useful achievements of the last 300 years than I fear we are. <br><br>Salih, that's a very challenging path that leaves you with few options if things go wrong, and it also depends on the stability of natural ecosystems -- not something to count on just now. You might consider seeing what other skills you could learn, or already have, that would make you an asset to some existing community. <br><br>Bill, I'm just going to quietly back away from the mathematics at this point and hope that nobody gets clobbered by a stray exponential or something. <br><br>Joel, you'd be surprised how many people don't get the implications of the sigmoid function. I forget which very prominent cornucopian, a bona fide scientist at that, used to claim that the human population could continue to grow at its 1970s pace for millions of years; he was one of the guys who insisted that ingenuity is the only resource we need, and since increasing population means an increasing number of geniuses (assuming a fixed number of geniuses per capita, apparently), it didn't matter how many people there were. <br><br>Charley, it's been quite a while since I watched that film and I managed to miss the Fourth Way stuff altogether. Nice. <br><br>SweaterMan, doubtless that's true. Since technology to most people is a collection of black boxes in which miracles occur, the idea that it might not be possible to come up with a desired black box on demand is hard for many to grasp. <br><br>As a library professional, by the way, you might consider contacting Librarian of Hillman and joining the League of Doomer Librarians!<br><br>Bill, the one thing that can make trajectories in the future easier to predict is the one thing that mathematics, by its nature, leaves out: history. When a given trajectory repeats itself reliably in history, it's reasonable to use that trajectory as a model for the future even when you don't understand why the trajectory happens.

The end of the space age, which will very likely occur in our lifetimes, is going to be a trauma even for those of us who have more or less given up on the delusive logic underlying it. (I'm 48, and remember the Apollo 11 landing very clearly.) The thing to remember is that the mythology of space gets its power from the whole broad dynamic of the religion of progress that underlies it; the reason rockets intoxicate us is that they epitomize our collective self-image. The fact that this image is a delusion doesn't make it any less powerful. <br><br>Pasttense, I'll check with the web people working on the forum and see if we can incorporate polls in it. <br><br>Wordek, once you start suggesting that the universe is tending in a particular direction that happens to have us at its leading edge, you're engaging in mythology.

Dirigibles are a good example of the kind that almost sort of worked; they were supposed to be the future of aviation -- find any 19th century portrayal of the future, and airship travel is part of it -- but they turned out to be floating white elephants. Ornithopters, which also had a place as the supposed future of aviation at one point, are a good example of the kind that didn't work at all. <br><br>MyName, by that logic we ought to keep trying to build perpetual motion machines.

First, regarding fusion power, I remember something that I think you wrote recently to the effect "the potential energy in the gravity required to compact the mass of a star sufficient to initiate fusion exceeds by orders of magnitude the energy output from the fusion reaction." I've never seen this explained elsewhere but I accepted your statement because it makes sense on a larger scale. All the efforts to master fusion power are doomed to failure because we are trying to master the effect not the cause - gravity. I think that were we to describe the requirements of mastering fusion power as what they really are, mastering gravity, the credibility of our modern day conjurers, scientists, as it were, would fail to pass even the most ardent believer's reasonableness test. I think that it is here, scientists failure to acknowlege their own limits in the pursuit of fusion power, that I lost faith in the omnipotence of science. This resulted in much wandering in the forest looking for a new omnipotent presence to follow. It appears now that the forest is the natural state of being, using the skills of many wizards to fashion a home among all of the earth's creatures.<br><br>I forgot the second point.<br><br><a href=cybernetics-of-black-knights.html#c5038078750167877370 title="comment permalink">7/31/10, 10:04 AM</a><br><br>

The laws of physics and chemistry and biology show that life is almost inevitable wherever the conditions are right, and the right conditions must have occured in many, many places in a Universe of trillions of galaxies that has existed for billions of years.<br><br>Perhaps the Aliens all killed themselves shortly after they discovered how to split the atom. Maybe they survived nuclear war only to wipe themselves out with run-away nanotechnology. Maybe they all elected politicians like Barack Obama who killed their space programs in favor of social welfare programs closer to home, which prevented them from ever visiting us. Or, maybe they just overpopulated their home planets and ran out of resources, but then lived happily within their means as green wizards until the next giant asteroid impact wiped them out.<br><br>So, is Peak Oil the reason why there are no signs of life in this vast Universe? Maybe they all had a brief period of high per-capita energy use (like we have now), followed by a long era at the ox-cart and hand tool level of technology until a natural cosmic disaster (that they no longer had the technology to prevent) finished them off?<br><br>The science fiction writer Larry Niven once observed that the dinosaurs are extinct because they did not have a sufficiently advanced space program. If they'd had the necessary technology, they could have gone up and stopped that giant asteroid before it hit the Earth 65 million years ago, in which case they would still be here, and we wouldn't...<br><br>Every hundred years or so we get hit by something the size of the Tunguska event (about a hundred years ago). Every couple thousand years we get hit by something the size of the meteorite that blasted out Meteor Crater in Arizona. Every couple million years we get hit by something big enough to wipe out most of the species on the planet.<br><br>So, here is a reason why we MUST continue operating in space, even if we run out of fossil fuels down here on Earth: sooner or later some big chunk of space debris is going to smack us hard enough to wipe us out. If we are not in a position to be able to prevent this inevitable event, it's Game over. <br><br>So, doing something like mining the moon and asteroids to build solar power satellites to provide sufficient energy to keep technological civilization running even after all the fossil fuels are depleted may, in fact, be necessary for the long-term survival of the human species.<br><br>JMG: The religion of progress is not necessarily a delusion.

Several reasons why...<br><br>They happen on the timescale of 100s of millions of years, not a few million years.<br><br>Very very very few species last 100,000,000 years before going extinct for some other reason (sometimes they evolve into something else), regardless of the asteroids. Worrying about the asteroid is kinda like worrying you'll be killed by terrorists on your way to the grocery store -- you are so many thousands of times more likely to get killed in a car crash, just put your seatbelt on and forget the terrorists. <br><br>Mass extinctions don't ever wipe out every living thing; otherwise there would have been only one of them. General patterns include that they tend to be harder on bigger animals than smaller ones, and they tend to be harder on marine organisms than terrestrial ones. Many plants and animals in fact make it through them. Rather than sinking our dwindling resources in to an asteroid defense capability (that the odds are miniscule we'd ever need before we go extinct for some other reason), it makes more sense for people who live wherever, whenever, to make plans to survive any major cataclysm that might interrupt food supplies and such. You might think a species with the ability to improve its own food supplies, store food, use many different kinds of food, and to some extent anticipate the future, even the unlikely events, would have a better than average chance of surviving the next Big One. No spaceships required. <br><br>Besides, maintaining a space program is not possible without abundant cheap energy. We're not even gonna keep the cars running forever, how will we be flying rockets?<br><br>All religions are delusions (I am not an atheist, yet I still believe this). If you follow any religion you should be fully aware of this, lest you get caught up in the many logical and conceptual errors it will lead you to.

From Clarke and Asimov to Andre Norton (I loved her books - recently read a few again), it was simply obvious that we would go into space. Movies and TV too of course. I was a SciFi junkie.<br><br>But it was an illusion - or perhaps more strongly it was a lie.<br><br>We went to the moon to get there before the commies. Sputnik showed that our team was falling behind, and we had to prove we were better. Most of the technology derived from military programs. Without these things we never would have gone there - and beyond the thrill, what did we really get out of it?<br><br>I am convinced that humans are inherently attracted to large amounts of energy, even if many don't understand at all how it works. From fast horses, then cars and trains and aircraft, to giant warships, bombs and guns, most of what thrills people involves controlling large amounts of energy. Perhaps because our bodies are puny compared to other animals, but with tools and fire we were able to become compete. Regardless, space travel is partly just another example of this somewhat simplistic thrill.<br><br>It's hard to let go of though. But it's OK to hold on to a few of those great stories of the age of energy, as long as you recognize them for what they are.

Your basic kid's microscope these days has better optics than the ones Pasteur used. <br><br>Tom, I haven't read it yet, and clearly I need to. Thanks for the reference!<br><br>Steve, I spoke sloppily in that earlier post -- the potential energy of gravitational contraction that brings a star together and ignites it isn't greater than the energy released by the star through fusion -- but massive gravity is still the only known force in the cosmos that can provide enough steady pressure focused inward toward a single point, unaffected by electrical charge, to ignite fusion. So your basic point stands. <br><br>Don, thanks for the link. <br><br>Moose, we no longer have the resources or the energy for a space program, so insisting that we have to have one is a bit like insisting that the Titanic should have had more lifeboats after the iceberg's already hit.

It would have been a lot wittier than the stuff written by Larry Niven. <br><br>DIYer, human beings think with narratives as inevitably as they talk with mouths and walk with feet; urban legends are what you get when the stories your culture offers won't let you think the thoughts you want to think. <br><br>Bill, as metazoa go, we're big enough to be very much at risk in mass extinctions. The tyrannochicken rex you had for dinner last night is enough smaller to make the difference. <br><br>Twilight, down the road a bit I'm going to be talking a lot about the end of the space age, and thus of the decline and fall of science fiction -- which is what I grew up reading, too, and what I first tried to write professionally.

The point I was trying to make was that alien societies, like our own societies, may have different priorities, and Space may not necessarily be at the top of the list.

What's the worst that could happen? Humans go the way of the dinosaurs, and the cockroaches and rats take over, just like our little rodent ancestors were left after all the big lizards were gone. After a couple tens or hundreds of millions of years, the descendants of the rats develop intelligence and learn how to use tools. So far, so good; we've seen this movie before. But what will they use for energy?<br><br>Well, in that hundred million year stretch between the end of Human civilization and the rise of the Rats, good old Mother Nature has been covering the land with huge forests, and billions of tons of dead trees will have been buried and converted into... coal? And out in the continental shelves at the mouths of all the great rivers, more billions of tons of micro-organisms which have been flowing out to be buried in the ocean silt will have turned into... oil? <br><br>Maybe the Rats will be the ones who end up mining the asteroids (why not? In science fiction, asteroid miners are often referred to as "rock rats"). Maybe we could leave a big monolith on the Moon for them to discover a few hundred million years from now, along with a gold tablet telling them what not to do...<br><br><a href=cybernetics-of-black-knights.html#c8439704568506605821 title="comment permalink">8/1/10, 1:03 AM</a><br><br>

First regarding fusion.. actually the total fusion research budget for 2011 is only $348M.. less than the salary of a average government subsidized hedgefund manager and 1/68th of what we spend in the Iraqi occupation in a month. That said useful fusion would have to provide cheap electricity to keep technological civilization going.. as far as I can tell, technologies like Inertial Electrostatic Confinement are far more promising (and a lot cheaper).. I think fusion is worth pursing as long as we can because there really are no alternatives for high density energy for the long term.<br>I spend a fair amount of time poking people around NASA (being a spacecraft engineer) and very few in the US can answer "WHY" . why send humans to the moon,mars. Europeans at least think more about it, but outside of the science program which gets great returns, IMHO, manned space has to support energy or resources.<br>Do I personally think this will happen?..

I'll have to read that one again. <br><br>Bill, I wasn't specifically talking about asteroid impacts; megafauna are vulnerable to all kinds of extinction crises. As for the cardinal grand cross, well, we'll see. <br><br>Tracy, you're welcome! Do try handspinning sometime, if you haven't yet; everyone I know who's done it loves it. <br><br>Moose, I'd go even further. The end of our civilization is just the end of one more civilization; there have been quite a few, and there will doubtless be many more, even if you're just counting our species -- and of course you're right about potential replacements (though my money is on the raccoons). <br><br>Sgage, hard to tell, but I'd buy a copy the moment it came out. <br><br>Bill, the interesting thing is that human psychology follows the logic of game theory rather than that of probability when it comes to risk. According to game theory, the most successful strategy is to identify the worst possible outcome, however unlikely it might appear to be, and eliminate it as a possibility; then go on to the worst possible of the remaining outcomes, and do the same; repeat, until eventually you win by not losing. I suspect it's a good way of doing things, as it does seem to have been hardwired into human thinking by evolution. <br><br>Hapibeli, nice! I'll have to look that one up. <br><br>Lew, my "long descent" theory includes sudden downward lurches, of the sort that history features so often. The sack of Rome by the Visigoths was not a drawn-out process. That said, I've rarely found much value in doomer porn; I haven't read the book you're citing, but the dieoff rate seems very extreme for a relatively small city in the midst of a large agricultural area, at a time when electronics that aren't vulnerable to EMP (vacuum tubes, for example) are still a matter of living memory and can be found en masse in surplus stores and the basements of ham radio operators. <br><br>Cathy, and of course if the power goes down for good on a space station, everyone either leaves or dies. I prefer to live on a planet where the biosphere takes care of basic chores like producing oxygen for me. <br><br>Jamie, first, how many solar water heaters would $348 million a year buy over the next decade? Second, at what point do we finally 'fess up to the fact that fusion isn't an alternative either, and start to figure out how to get by on the resources our planet has to offer us over the long term? We've spent gargantuan amounts of money paying for fifty years of failed fusion projects, and we're no closer to a viable fusion reactor than we were in 1960; as I see it, it's long past time that we stop pretending that fusion is anything but a make-work program for physicists.<br><br><a href=cybernetics-of-black-knights.html#c5079222762478577432 title="comment permalink">8/1/10, 8:19 PM</a><br><br>

I think you have also turned my specific point (that people's generally poor "common sense" -- i.e. emotional, psychological -- evaluations of relative risks are often off the mark my many, many, many orders of magnitude, and that this could be important for household and community decisions about what to prepare for and how to prepare for it) into a general meditation on rationality and common sense. <br><br>Our evolutionary instincts tell us to eat all the sweet and fatty foods we can get our hands on - that is not working out so well for us now.

Because of this cultural milieu most of us are running around with psyches that have been deliberately tied in knots that are neither rational nor common sense. Can you really try to make a case that our ingrained game theory instincts (evolved in a environment vastly different than the one we are in now) are the best guides here?

I'm quite aware that the strategies proposed by game theory are counterintuitive for people raised in a culture that prefers to think in terms of probabilities, and of course it's easy to make any viewpoint look absurd if that's what you set out to do. If you want to disagree with the points made in von Neumann and Morgenstern's <i>Theory of Games and Economic Behavior</i>, by all means; still, it looks to me as though you're mistaking one particular set of strategies (those relying on probability) with rationality as a whole, and that's hardly a constructive approach. <br><br>Sgage, that was pretty much my point, or part of it. Given that there are upper limits to the complexity of strategies that can be hardwired into a mammalian nervous system, "identify the worst case scenarios and eliminate them in order of badness" does seem to pay off better than "try to guess the probability of a negative scenario and eliminate the most probable ones first" in terms of basic evolutionary fitness.<br><br><a href=cybernetics-of-black-knights.html#c6446666608288939498 title="comment permalink">8/2/10, 11:44 AM</a><br><br>

When design obsolescence made quality less important (after all your gadget is going to be replaced in 3 years anyway) it didn't take long for this to spread and manifest as quality obsolescence even in items where the design doesn't change radically over time.<br><br>I've noticed also that there also seems to be a vague correlation between high quality and tough times, (maybe because breakdowns are less likely to result in the more severe types of “inconvenience” they used to) so that now for instance if you want a cheap reliable diesel engine you dont buy an English Lister, you buy an Indian Listeroid ( Built off the original Lister designs)<br><br>http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/001011.php<br><br>(Love those old Listers in case you hadn't noticed) <br>We had one running the cowshed before electricity arrived (bout the same time I did) and even after then the old man had it running the washdown pump well into the '80's. Compression off, wind the flywheel until there was enough momentum and then compression on. I dont remember it ever failing to start (even with a scrawny little brat doing the winding). ;)<br><br>http://www.utterpower.com Has some information about Listers... Try this snippet for a laugh....<br><br>"There is a documented story of an automotive engineer showing up at a state fair booth where a guy was demonstrating an oil additive. they had a motor set up where two pieces of metal rubbed together and you could see the reduced friction when their product was added. The Engineer asked the guy running the booth if he would try 'his stuff', .... new pieces of metal were installed and this mystery concoction was added. To the amazement of the Booth Operator, he couldn't apply enough pressure to the disk to slow it down! The performance of this mystery stuff was off the chart, and clearly better than the stuff he was selling. <br>What was it????.... Head and Shoulders Shampoo.... right out of the bottle! Loaded with Zinc to control dandruff. Should you use Head and Shoulders to lube the valve train in the Lister design?  Probably not, but it is a good case for finding something with high levels of Zinc in it. Since synthetics have much higher film strengths, it may make sense for a person to use it in this application as well."<br><br><a href=cybernetics-of-black-knights.html#c8651610265758776820 title="comment permalink">8/2/10, 12:51 PM</a><br><br>

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c7181820976793900801></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/17159434109202830647 rel=nofollow>sebzefrog</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Reading the posts, I found the somewhat heated discussion about game theory vs probabilistic approach interesting in the context of information flow. <br><br>I will (with a tang of sadness) set asside the part about evolution. It is too large a subject. Instead, I will concentrate on the sentence:" How often supposedly rational grounds been used to dismiss some traditional piece of common sense, only to have it turn out that the common sense was right all along? " <br>When I read it, the information that I filter out fires up alarms and automatic reactions. Recognizing that some alarms went of, and forcing myself to inaction, I read again the sentence, turning my filters off.I also bring in more relevent data, like what I think I gathered on our dear Archdruid ability to really think instead of blurping out "lieux communs". <br><br>Then, here is what I read: "How often have SUPPOSEDLY RATIONAL grounds been used to dismiss some traditional piece of COMMON SENSE, only to have it turn out that the COMMON SENSE was right all along? " <br> <br>To compare to the filtered version that fired up my alarms: "How often have RATIONAL GROUNDS been used to dismiss some TRADITION, only to have it turn out that the TRADITION WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG?" <br><br>Very different indeed. Filters, metaphors, models are useful to make sense of the world, but they tend to create an internal world of their own that can shape our perception of the world very strongly. <br><br>Now, after slaying the Chimera, if I look at the idea expressed, I see two concepts: common sense, and bad thinking in a lab coat, called "supposedly rational thinking". The answer to JMG rethorical question is thus, in my opinion: often. <br><br>Conversely, I think that "RATIONAL grounds" being right when "SUPPOSEDLY common sense based on tradition" is proven wrong happens very often too. <br><br>I actually think that both points describe the same behavior. Forgive me (and correct me) if I am wrong, but I think it is some kind of magical thinking using a powerful name (Tradition or Rational) to validate a point, further thinking being a collateral damage. <br><br>In my experience this behavior relies on the use of one of those two incantations (or derived ones):<br><br>a) "We are but dwarves on the shoulders of giants." <br>b) "It has been scientifically proven." <br><br>Yes, I put down b) as an incantation. As a scientist, I dont' use b. I use it's rational version of b: "It has been scientifically proven by Such et al. in Journal Of Stuff 1915". The crucial difference is that this version is not a thought stopper. It is an invitation to disagree, go check, and come back proving me wrong. In the same way, a) doesn't refer to "traditionnal hides behind tradition. There are ways to refer to traditionnal common sense that don't discard further thinking. <br>The point in both cases being to point out that a piece of information that went through the sieve of many minds is worth consideration before being discarded. <br><br>Comming back to my first point about mental traps, wich is the main point of my post, I think that there lies one of the main tresures of science, maybe the main one. Proposing a system that helps finding and avoiding mental traps when thinking. Proposing a systematic sieve that allows to make sense out of data while offering safeguards against our own Chimera. And any time we use a capitalized "Scientifically Proven" or a "This is Tradition", we take one step away from this treasure.<br><br>Have a nice day <br>Sebzefrog at hotmail.fr<br><br><a href=cybernetics-of-black-knights.html#c7181820976793900801 title="comment permalink">8/3/10, 7:22 AM</a><br><br>

The problem with information is there is way too much out there to deal with. I have to prioritise what I read as well as what I do, in fact I have to prioritise the priorities. My eyes are bigger than my belly in terms of reading matter I can actually get through compared to what is already in the house and the ongoing additions from second-hand bookshops, Amazon etc. So for example I am still only part-way through the Ecology book as I can only manage a chapter in one go on a free evening. <br><br>I also have stuff I read to relax, mainly Science Fiction, it doesn't mean I believe implicity in the futures portrayed. I do feel that reading Sci-Fi has value in broadening one's viewpoint on a whole range of issues that do or could affect the future, so making it easier to think through where we as a society are headed. As a Sci-Fi reader I think that has contributed to my awareness of the issues compared to the majority of people around me.<br><br><a href=cybernetics-of-black-knights.html#c5360365542049371348 title="comment permalink">8/3/10, 1:38 PM</a><br><br>

You've got the hot fusion just about right (too bad that nobody wants to go to the conspiracies against cold fusion by the hot fusion people).<br>I've been thinking on Nature as random vs Life as anti-entropy amid the quantum foam. <br>Intentions also are left behind as a friend with intentional tremors keeps me from allowing language that puts intention into any explanation of where matter comes from. On human intention; that is a great window analogy to use. On a more macro scale, however, "People do stuff, They have reasons for doing stuff. In that order." This is more than half the story of humanity, but we believe our minority actions (intentional ones) are the rule. In our daily choices (paint the window vs. go back to bed), we sometimes make ourselves useful. That is my answer to Everything: Net Usefulness. It answers the "information becoming particles" and it answers "how does a species survive?" Many of us would be less Net Consumptive if we just went back to bed instead of trying to build fusion reactors. Even better would be to play some music to help useful work go more smoothly.<br><br> Best regards, and thanks once more for great thinking.<br>Dan<br><br><a href=cybernetics-of-black-knights.html#c2552854345431698377 title="comment permalink">8/8/10, 6:42 AM</a><br><br>
