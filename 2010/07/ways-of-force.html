By now those of my readers who have joined me on the current <i>Archdruid Report</i> project – the creation of a “green wizardry” using the heritage of the appropriate technology movement of the Seventies – should have downloaded at least one of their textbooks and either have, or be waiting for the imminent arrival of, the rest. Now it’s time to get into the core principles of green wizardry, and the best way to do it involves shifting archetypes a bit. Give me a moment to slip on a brown robe, tuck something less clumsy or random than a blaster into my belt, and practice my best Alec Guinness imitation: yes, Padawans, you’re about to start learning the ways of the Force.<br><br>Well, almost. The concept that George Lucas borrowed from Asian mysticism for his <i>Star Wars</i> movies is an extraordinarily widespread and ancient one; very nearly the only languages on earth that don’t have a commonly used word for an intangible life force connected to the breath are those spoken nowadays in the industrial nations of the modern West. I’ll leave it to my readers to make up their own minds about what the remarkable durability of this idea might imply, and to historians of ideas to debate whether it was one of the sources that helped shape the modern scientific concept of energy; the point that needs making is that it’s this latter concept that will be central to this week’s post.<br><br>That’s understating things by more than a little. Everything we’ll be exploring over the weeks and months to come has to do with energy: where it comes from, what it can and can’t do, how it moves through whole systems, and where it goes. In the most pragmatic of senses, understand energy and you understand the whole art of green wizardry; in the broadest of senses, understand energy and you understand the predicament that is looming up like a wave in front of the world’s industrial societies, and what we can and can’t expect to get done in the relatively short time we have left before that predicament crests, breaks, and washes most of the modern world’s certainties away.<br><br>Let’s start with some basic definitions. Energy is the capacity to do work. It cannot be created or destroyed, but the amount and kind of work it can do can change. The more concentrated it is, the more work it can do; the more diffuse it is, the less work it can do. Left to itself, it moves from more concentrated to more diffuse forms over time, and everything you do with energy has a price tag measured in a loss of concentration. These are the groundrules of thermodynamics, and everything a green wizard does comes back to them in one way or another.<br><br>Let’s look at some examples. A garden bed, to begin with, is a device for collecting energy from the sun by way of the elegant biochemical dance of photosynthesis. Follow a ray of sunlight from the thermonuclear cauldron of the sun, across 93 million miles of hard vacuum and a few dozen miles of atmosphere, until it falls on the garden bed. Around half the sunlight reflects off the plants, which is why the leaves look bright green to you instead of flat black; most of the rest is used by the plants to draw water up from the ground into their stems and leaves, and expel it into the air; a few per cent is caught by chloroplasts – tiny green disks inside the cells of every green plant, descended from blue-green algae that were engulfed but not destroyed by some ancestral single-celled plant maybe two billion years ago – and used to turn water and carbon dioxide into sugars, which are rich in chemical energy and power the complex cascade of processes we call life.<br><br>Most of those sugars are used up keeping the plant alive. The rest are stored up until some animal eats the plant. Most of the energy in the plants the animal eats gets used up keeping the animal alive; the rest get stored up, until another animal eats the first animal, and the process repeats. Sooner or later an animal manages to die without ending up in somebody else’s stomach, and its body becomes a lunch counter for all the creatures – and there are a lot of them – that make their livings by cleaning up dead things. By the time they’re finished with their work, the last of the energy from the original beam of sunlight that fell on the garden bed is gone.<br><br>Where does it go? Diffuse background heat. That’s the elephant’s graveyard of thermodynamics, the place energy goes to die. Most often, when you do anything with energy – concentrate it, move it, change its form – the price for that gets paid in low-grade heat. All along the chain from the sunlight first hitting the leaf to the last bacterium munching on the last scrap of dead coyote, what isn’t passed onward in the form of stored chemical energy is turned directly or indirectly into heat so diffuse that it can’t be made to do any work other than jiggling molecules a little. The metabolism of the plant generates a trickle of heat; the friction of the beetle’s legs on the leaf generates a tiny pulse of heat; the mouse, the snake, and the coyote all turn most of the energy they take in into heat, and all that heat radiates out into the great outdoors, warming the atmosphere by a tiny fraction of a degree, and slowly spreading up and out into the ultimate heat sink of deep space.<br><br>That’s the first example. For the second, let’s take a solar water heater, the simple kind that’s basically a tank in a glassed-in enclosure set on top of somebody’s roof. Once again we start with a ray of sunlight crossing deep space and Earth’s murky atmosphere to get to its unintended target. The sun passes through the glass and slams into the black metal of the water tank, giving up much of its energy to the metal in the form of heat. Inside the metal is water, maybe fifty gallons of it; it takes a fair amount of heat to bring fifty gallons of water to the temperature of a good hot bath, but the steady pounding of photons from the sun against the black metal tank will do the trick in a few hours.<br><br>Most of what makes building a solar water heater complex is a matter of keeping that heat in the water where it belongs, instead of letting it leak out as – you guessed it – diffuse background heat. The glass in front of the tank is there to keep moving air from carrying heat away, and it also helps hold heat in by way of a clever bit of physics: most of the energy that matter absorbs from visible light downshifts to infrared light as it tries to escape, and glass lets visible light pass through it but reflects infrared back the way it came. (This is known as the greenhouse effect, by the way, and we’ll be using it over and over again, not least in greenhouses.) All surfaces of the tank that aren’t facing the sun are surrounded by insulation, which also helps keep heat from sneaking away. If the system’s a good one, the pipes that carry hot water down from the heater to the bathtub and other uses are wrapped with insulation. Even so, some of the energy slips out from the tank, some of it makes a break for it through the insulation around the pipes, and the rest of it starts becoming background heat the moment it leaves the faucet for the bathtub or any other use.<br><br>Here’s a third example: a house on a cold winter day. The furnace keeping it warm, let’s say, is fueled by natural gas; that means the ray of sunlight that ultimately powers the process came to Earth millions of years ago and was absorbed by a prehistoric plant. The plant died without being munched by a passing dinosaur, and got buried under sediment with some of its stored energy intact. Millions of years of heat and pressure underground turned that stored energy into very simple hydrocarbons such as methane and ethane. Fast forward to 2010, when the hydrocarbons found their way through pores in the rock to a natural gas well and got shipped by pipeline, possibly over thousands of miles, to the house where it gets burnt.<br><br>The furnace turns the energy of that ancient sunlight to relatively concentrated heat, which flows out through the house, keeping it warm. Now the fun begins, because that concentrated energy – to put things in anthropomorphic terms – wants nothing in the world half as much as to fling itself ecstatically into dissolution as diffuse background heat. The more quickly it can do that, though, the more natural gas has to be burnt to keep the house at a comfortable temperature. If you’re the green wizard in charge, your goal is to slow down the dionysiac rush of seeking its bliss, and make it hang around long enough to warm the house.<br><br>How do you do that? First, you have to know the ways that heat moves from a warm body to a cold one. There are three of them: conduction, which is the movement of heat through solid matter; convection, which is the movement of heat carried on currents of air (or any other fluid); and radiation, which is the movement of heat in the form of infrared light (mostly) through any medium transparent to those wavelengths. You slow down conduction to a crawl by putting insulation in the way; you slow down convection by sealing up cracks through which air can move, and doing a variety of things to stop convective currents from forming; you slow down radiation by putting reflective barriers in the way of its escape. If you don’t do any of these things, your house leaks heat, and your checking account leaks money ; if you do all of these things – and they can be done fairly easily and cheaply – the prehistoric sunlight in the natural gas you burn has to take its time wandering out of your house, keeps you comfortable on the way, and you don’t have to spend anything like so much on more natural gas to replace it.<br><br>There are four points I’d like you to take home from these examples. The first is that they’re all talking about the same process – the movement of energy from the sun to the background radiation of outer space that passes through systems here on earth en route, and accomplishes certain kinds of work on the way. At this point, in fact, the most useful thing you can take away from this entire discussion is the habit of looking everything that goes on around you as an energy flow that starts from a concentrated source – almost always the sun – and ends in diffuse heat radiating out into space. If you pick up the habit of doing this, you’ll find that a great deal of the material that will be covered in posts to come will suddenly seem like common sense, and a great many of the habits that have are treated as normal behavior in our society will suddenly reveal themselves as stark staring lunacy.<br><br>An exercise, which I’d like to ask those readers studying this material to do several times over the next week, will help get this habit in place. Draw a rough flow chart for one or more versions of this process. Take a piece of paper, draw a picture of the sun at the top, and draw a trash can at the bottom; label the trash can “Background Heat.” Now draw the important components in any system you want to understand, and draw arrows connecting them to show how the energy moves from one component to another. If you’re sketching a natural system, draw in the plants, the herbivores, the carnivores, and the decomposers, and sketch in how energy passes from one to another, and from each of them to the trash can; if you’re sketching a human system, the energy source, the machine that turns the energy into a useful form, and the places where the energy goes all need to be marked in and connected. Do this with a variety of different systems. It doesn’t matter at this stage if you get all the details right; the important thing is to start thinking in terms of energy flow.<br><br>The second point to take home is that natural systems, having had much more time to work the bugs out, are much better at containing and using energy than most human systems are. The solar water heater and the house with its natural gas furnace take concentrated energy, put it to one use, and then lose it to diffuse heat. A natural ecosystem, by contrast, can play hot potato with its own input of concentrated energy for a much more extended period, tossing it from hand to hand (or, rather, leaf to paw to bacterial pseudopod) for quite a while before all of the energy finally follows its bliss. The lesson here is simple: by paying attention to the ways that natural systems do this, green wizards can get hints that can be incorporated into human systems to make them less wasteful and more resilient.<br><br>The third point is that energy does not move in circles. Next week we’ll be talking about material substances, which do follow circular paths – in fact, they do this whether we want them to do so or not, which is why the toxic waste we dump into the environment, for example, ends up circling back around into our food and water supply. Energy, though, moves along a trajectory with a beginning and an end. The beginning is always a concentrated source, which again is almost always the sun; the end is diffuse heat. Conceptually, you can think of energy as moving in straight lines, cutting across the circles of matter and the far more complex patterns of information gain and loss. Once a given amount of energy has followed its trajectory to the endpoint, for all practical purposes, it’s gone; it still exists, but the only work it’s capable of doing is making molecules vibrate at whatever the ambient temperature happens to be.<br><br>The fourth and final point, which follows from the third, is that for all practical purposes, energy is finite. It’s become tolerably common for believers in perpetual technological progress and economic growth to insist that energy is infinite, with the implication that human beings can up and walk off with as much of it as they wish. It’s an appealing fantasy, flattering to our collective ego, and it makes use of a particular kind of mental trap that Garrett Hardin anatomized quite a while ago. In his useful book <i>Filters Against Folly</i>, Hardin pointed out that the word “infinite” – along with such synonyms as “limitless” and “boundless” – are thoughtstoppers rather than meaningful concepts, because the human mind can’t actually think about infinity in any meaningful sense. When somebody says “X is infinite,” in other words, what he is actually saying is “I refuse to think about X.”<br><br>Still, there’s a more specific sense in which talk about infinite energy is nonsense by definition. At any given place and time, the amount of energy that is available in a concentration and a form capable of doing any particular kind of work is finite, often distressingly so. Every ecosystem on earth has evolved to make the most of whatever energy is available to do the work of keeping living things alive, whether that energy takes the form of equatorial sunlight shining down on the Amazon rain forest, chemical energy in sulfur-laden water surging up from hot springs at the bottom of the sea, or fat stored up during the brief Arctic warm season in the bodies of the caribou that attract the attention of a hungry wolf pack.<br><br>Thus it’s crucial to recognize that available energy is always limited, and usually needs to be carefully coaxed into doing as much work as you want to get done before the energy turns into diffuse background heat. This is as true of any whole system, a garden as much as a solar hot water system, a well-insulated house, or any other project belonging to the field of appropriate tech. Learn to think in these terms and you’re well on your way to becoming a green wizard.

This would be very useful for prioritizing projects (there are a huge number of different energy saving things one can do, many of marginal value) as well as providing a general benchmark (a year from now to be able to say "I am using 15% less energy than I was a year ago"). <br>Could someone present a methodology for calculating this?<br><br><a href=ways-of-force.html#c8360021704094603111 title="comment permalink">7/14/10, 9:40 PM</a><br><br>

We've talked about this before, that metaphysical "energy" and real physical energy are not at all the same phenomenon. Yet, in newage-y general discourse the two are widely confused, and physical terminology is wrongly applied to metaphysical concepts. They are not the same, they come from very different conceptual formulations, they are not interchangeable, they do not have the same properties or obey the same laws, they aren't really even good metaphors for each other. I think it is very important for one to be clear on this distinction if one's intent is results in the physical world. You can raise all the "energy" you want through meditation, ceremonial magic, skillfully placed crystals, and inspired use of language, but that will still avail you nothing if your plants just are not getting enough sunlight (physical energy)! Of course one can argue the converse, that you can give your garden all the sunlight it could use but if the chi is wrong it will still not flourish. Two different things, neither will substitute for the other.<br><br>Just important to keep in mind. If your house is cold (the temperature is low), look to the thermodynamics; if your house is cold (uninviting, sad, off-putting) look to the feng shui.<br><br><a href=ways-of-force.html#c5296592249049788137 title="comment permalink">7/14/10, 9:47 PM</a><br><br>

Matter cycling endlessly, and energy going inexorably from source to sink, were both familiar concepts, but I hadn't imagined them side-by-side the way you describe. It's a very powerful description.<br><br>The more mystical of my friends tend to insist that information follows the same rules as energy, and media trade groups are trying desperately to require that it follows the same rules as matter.

Catalytic reactions can re-conserve heat energy (or rather, Brownian motion/jiggling molecules and/or atoms with an affinity for each other can crash into each other in the just the right way can re-trap some of the heat/motion energy). And while fossil fuel energy is severely limited, there are vast reserves of very highly concentrated energy that hold any given atom together. The energy that holds molecules together -- which is what we tap when we burn fossil fuels -- is miniscule by comparison. Tapping into and channeling that energy without blowing ourselves to smithereens is another story, of course.<br><br><a href=ways-of-force.html#c3517976231487338690 title="comment permalink">7/15/10, 5:38 AM</a><br><br>

Thirty-three years ago this coming fall, in my first college semester, I discovered the discipline of geography and fell in love with it. Enough so to complete a BA, MA, and Ph.D. degree in the geography, the latter focusing on water resources and physical geography, and going on to teach the same for seven years at the college level, plus working in the government for five more years on related matters. Much of what you are teaching, JMG, is at the core of what is taught in the discipline of geography, which is very much an integrative discipline, particularly in that half we call physical geography, which inevitably starts with talking about the Sun, its energy, forms of energy, entropy, and the likes.<br><br>I even attempted a blog (started about four years ago and now much neglected and devolved into a place where I only very occasionally process my thoughts) with the goal and hope of actually doing just what you are now doing. My goal with PostOilGeography (http://postoilgeography.blogspot.com/) was much in the same mindset of your Green Wizardry. In my case, it was the desire at the time to develop a entire series of "open source" PowerPoint or other formatted lectures and teaching sets on what a person should know about the Sun, energy, climate, soils, etc., to exist in a Post Oil world. I had tried to ask myself that if I had one hour, one morning, one day, one weekend, one week, one month, or one semester of your time, what would I want to teach you about living within the limits of sunlight (for instance) and the world around. I had dreams of hiring myself out as a lecturer to do just that, traveling wherever I was paid to go, to give such lectures.<br><br>Alas, I never seemed to have the energy left after each day's and week's work to follow up on that hope and plan. I am thrilled to see you take it up, both because I know you will succeed better than I through both your blog and eventual publications that will follow, and as a indirect affirmation that what I had identified years ago as a needed path to follow has seen external recognition of importance.<br><br><a href=ways-of-force.html#c5368283307495495765 title="comment permalink">7/15/10, 6:49 AM</a><br><br>

Although he probably wouldn't put it quite this way, it suddenly occurs to me that they're rather lovely counterspells, along the same line as "There is no brighter future ahead." They're a fundamental reality check.<br><br>On a happy note, I've found a friend who's interested in the second set of Master Conserver notes. So there will now be at least two copies of these in Hastings, Nebraska. And my experiment with keeping the solar oven at dehydrator temps was promising. I will try it for real in September, when our raspberry crop peaks. Since the oven was running about 10-15° hotter than ideal, it should work even better then.

Thinking in terms of energy flow allowed me to see that we need to take this sun energy that is needlessly being converted to infrared heat by dark surfaces and either bounce it back into space with light-colored materials or else convert it into more useful forms of work (ie passive and photovoltaic solar) on its way to becoming diffuse heat. The sun's energy can either be wasted on someone's hot roof doing nothing but heating up my neighborhood or can be harnessed to do the work that fossil fuels are now doing. In the end the same amount of heat ends up in the atmosphere, but the benefit is that less fossil fuel will be doing the work which means less CO2. Light-colored surfaces actually reduce the heat-load of the atmosphere by sending the sun's energy back into outer-space at the same wavelengh it came in on without converting it to the infrared spectrum (heat). Everyone should look through the eyes of a Flir infrared camera for a day to physically see energy 'flow'; a very neat and educational experience indeed.<br><br><a href=ways-of-force.html#c7813340927264991755 title="comment permalink">7/15/10, 8:45 AM</a><br><br>

If you look at something purely for what it fundamentally is, you'll tend to see it cycling. If you look at it purely for what it does, you'll tend to see it go from a source to some conclusion. Most of the entities in our lives are viewed (and their identities constructed in our culture) with a mix of those perspectives; you'll need to re-interpret them as bare matter or as manifestations of energy in order to see them follow one set of rules or the other in an entirely pure way.<br><br>2. Living things are complicated, and we ignore a lot of what makes them interesting if we see them either as simple matter, or as simply an energy source. Information is also tremendously important to their constitution, in my opinion.<br><br>3. The background temperature of outer space is about 3 Kelvin. That thermal energy is way too diffuse to apply to any sort of use. As time goes by, it is expected to warm up a little bit, but even if it did, there would be no way to apply that energy, beyond staying warm at night. Freeman Dyson expects that life will continue into that time, living extremely slow lives on the surfaces of exhausted stars.

One -- the ch'i I work with in t'ai chi and ch'i kung practice -- does actually behave a lot like physical energy (it's closest, in some ways, to static electricity). Most of the others have much less in common with physical energy. The point that has to be kept in mind, though, is the old magical axiom -- "The planes are discrete and not continuous" -- meaning that you can't casually convert one of these things into another. <br><br>Kevin, no, think of work more broadly. Warming a rock is work; so is keeping a mouse alive; so is hauling a dead hot water heater to the dump, and so on. Anything that causes change to matter is work. <br><br>Librarian, good questions. <br><br>1. We'll be discussing that in much more detail as we proceed. <br><br>2. Living beings are composite entities that participate in flows of energy, matter, and information, each of which follows its own laws. Here again, we'll get to that in much more detail as we go. <br><br>3. If the energy that diffuses into deep space eventually goes to make new suns or what have you, that's not something we will ever know, and the crucial thing to keep in mind is that in any human perspective, energy moves from source to sink and does not cycle back. <br><br>Karen, seriously cool. <br><br>Joel, good. You're thinking ahead. Yes, we'll be discussing information as we proceed. <br><br>Madtom, one step at a time! Many of my readers -- especially those who have the disadvantage of a recent American public school education -- have had no exposure at all to the ideas I'm trying to communicate, and it's always been my sense that it's best to start with simple models that make the essential concepts clear before getting into the fine details. We'll get to the latter in good time. <br><br>Rhisiart, diolch yn fawr!<br><br>Luke, thank you. <br><br>Stephen, exactly. You're getting it. <br><br>Jason, I first encountered "Rat On A Stick" in one of the old cheaply printed Judges' Guild publications in the late 1970s, and it was set up (as most JG products were) primarily for D&amp;D. Mind you, I played my share of most of the late Seventies fantasy RPGs, up to and including first edition Chivalry and Sorcery.<br><br>Mary, er, you're quibbling. Of course you can use the effects of catalysis and the like to make use of some otherwise wasted heat on its way to background, but that doesn't change the broader thermodynamic picture. As for nuclear energy, the vast majority of that is out of our reach -- try splitting a nitrogen atom sometime -- and what humanity can access requires huge inputs of cheap energy to mine, refine, process, and provide a reactor for the handful of very scarce and toxic substances that we can use, and what you get out the other end are wastes that are so hideously dangerous that they have to be kept separate from the rest of the biosphere for a quarter of a million years.

That's not my strong suite by any means, and it would be good to have info on the subject from somebody who knows it well. <br><br>Tracy, good!

I'm not much of a mathematician -- Pythagorean philosophical geometry is about the upper limit for me -- but the sense I've gotten is that the process of abstraction in mathematics allows human beings to manipulate abstract tokens or models of things we can't actually understand. The square root of -1 comes to mind here! We can construct an abstract representation of infinity, manipulate it, and come up with deductions that can actually tell us some of the properties of infinity, but -- at least as I see it -- that doesn't bring us any closer to being able to grapple with actual infinities, if there are any. <br><br>Don, good. You've encountered one of the very, very few energy sources here on earth that don't come from the sun.

Just plug it all in the matrix and the Chi drops out in the eigenvectors. Or something like that.<br><br>Dwig -- H.T. is much less accessible to a general audience than E.P., of the Odum brothers. But if you are inclined, H.T. is worth the effort. His ideas are more innovative and unorthodox (though fully compatible with E.P.'s work as well). Two fundamental concepts are critical to his work; you've gotta get them or the rest of it will never really come together. First, emergy = embodied energy. He traces all energy back to the sun (Don -- your point about geothermal applies here, more later). Emergy is the number of calories of solar energy it took to make one calorie of energy stored in some other form. The most basic example is the food chain. The sunlight falls on the grass, About 3% of this energy winds up stored as energy in the biomass of the grass. So from the original 100 calories of sunlight, you get 3 calories of grass. This ratio of 100:3, or 33.333, is the transformity for grass biomass. It means that every calorie of grass has an emergy of 33.333 calories of sunlight.<br><br>Next, the caterpillar eats the grass. About 1/10th of the grass biomass winds up as caterpillar biomass. Now, your transformity for the caterpillar = 10 times what it was for the grass, so it is now 333.333. Every calorie of caterpillar has an emergy of 333.33 solar calories. Same thing for the thrush that eats the caterpillar, giving it a transformity of 3333.333. And again for the hawk that eats the thrush, until finally the vulture that eats the hawk has a transformity of 333,333. So to make one calorie of tasty Vulture meat, it takes a third of a million calories of sunlight. That's the basic idea of emergy and tranformities.<br><br>The same logic applies to other forms of energy. The wind, the rain, the coal in the ground are ultimately forms of solar energy, each with their own transformity. And in actuality it takes more than just the sunlight to grow that grass, it also takes the wind, the rain, the nutrients in the soil. So when you calculate the whole system, the transformity for the grass is gonna be a lot higher than 33. H.T.'s work extends these ideas all the way through the environment and society; at one point he even calculates the emergy of a scientific publication, I believe. <br><br>About geothermal energy... the force that drives the volcanoes and raisies the mountains is not directly solar energy. I asked H.T. about this once. The idea we came to is that ultimately both the geothermal energy and the solar energy trace back to the same primordial source, the proto-sun which created the solar nebula from which the earth and our sun and all the other planets formed. In theory one could calculate a transformity between the two; in practice I think he just used a simplifying assumption of 1:1 and takes both as equivalent primary sources of energy. <br><br>The maximum power principle is controversial and not universally accepted. His idea is that self-organizing systems will evolve in such a way as to maximize power -- maximize the rate at which energy flows through them. This is in contrast to the idea that they would maximize efficiency -- the most complete transformation of energy in to work. It is a very interesting idea; he believed it would apply to cells, organisms, ecosystems, and also human societies and global civilizations. <br><br>Thos are the basics; ponder them until you really grasp them, and <i>E, P, &amp; S</i> will be much more comprehensible!<br><br>By the way, the first person I ever heard about Hubberd's Peak from was H.T. Odum, in about 1987. Some folks have been thinking about this stuff for a looooong time.<br><br><a href=ways-of-force.html#c269151535214639326 title="comment permalink">7/15/10, 7:54 PM</a><br><br>

"Spirit" is the classic example -- Medieval Latin <i>spiritus</i> was an exact translation of Chinese <i>ch'i</i>, down to fine points of usage, and fit into the standard division of everything in the universe into <i>anima</i> (consciousness), <i>spiritus</i> (life force), and <i>corpus</i> (physical body) in a way very familiar to the rest of the world. Nowadays "spirit" has all kinds of connotations totally irrelevant to its old meaning. <br><br>Moose, I don't know which of your jokes was the funnier -- the picture of Dorian Tomato, or the idea that human beings can aspire to godhood and outlast the stars. Curiously, though, your tomatoes have competition; our corn plants are well over ten feet tall, now that they've flowered, and our pole beans have spectacularly overtopped their poles and are now trying to snag startled bats and low-flying planes. <br><br>Lamb, your crystal ball is working well, I see. That discussion is two weeks away, when we've covered energy and matter and start talking about information. <br><br>Adrian, tell your anti-myth husband that 90% of wizardry is applied common sense. (The other 10%? I ain't telling.) <br><br>DPW, no question, we've made a real mess of things. The sooner we start trying to repair the damage, the less ghastly the blowback is going to be. <br><br>Panidaho, thanks for the book recommendation!<br><br>Dwig, I'd be just as interested in Bill's commentary. My take on Howard Odum's book is that it's a much more challenging, and rather more technical volume, more for the specialist than the common or garden variety green wizard. <br><br>Sofistek, excellent. You get it. Once you grasp that energy is limited, a lot of other basic realities that most people miss become very sharply clear. <br><br>Don, I think thermal sprints are a great idea. I used to use hsing-yi forms, which are very fast and vigorous, to warm up before t'ai chi practice on cold winter mornings; I bet sprinting would work just as well. ;-)<br><br>Fern, mostly, yes. <br><br>Njh, that depends on just how badly disrupted public order and transport networks become. The technical ability to build a factory isn't the only issue; you also have to consider the economic viability, which depends in turn on how wide an area you can use reliably as a source of raw materials and a distribution region for your products. Below a certain geographic scale, the old-fashioned drop spindle spinning local fibers becomes a more economical way of providing yarn to knitters, crocheters and weavers, simply because you can't pay for mass production with a very limited market area. Will we get there? To judge by past examples, yes, but probably not in our lifetimes -- which makes it all the more important to preserve skills like spinning now, so they don't have to be laboriously reinvented a few centuries from now. <br><br>Raven, heck of a good question. If some of those monks would be willing to demonstrate their skills when wired up by some capable sports physiologists, we could find out. <br><br>Mark, thank you.<br><br><a href=ways-of-force.html#c1994268643001887241 title="comment permalink">7/15/10, 7:55 PM</a><br><br>

The idea that human beings experience several different kinds, realms, or planes of existence, none of which can be reduced to any of the others, seems to me to make more sense of the universe of our experience than any attempt to collapse the nonphysical into the physical (or vice versa, for that matter).

It is what makes rivers that contiually fertilize the oceans. It is what recycles the crust and releases the water that has been chemically bound up within it, so we did not wind up like Mars with all the water locked in the rocks.

Emergy is a simple yet fundamental concept that when you get it in your head will forever alter and continually color your understanding of energy "in the wild." Maximum Power is a harder nut; in my day it had devotees of almost religious fervor, critics who thought it was bunk, and far larger numbers of people who didn't really see much point in it. Considering the general collapse of old-fashioned scholarship in Academia in recent decades, I suspect the last group has become even more dominant (just put it all in a GIS so we can make some eye-popping figures to show the funding agencies). <br><br>Re: chi: Fortunately, one doesn't have to know where chi comes from to figure out how to work with it rather than against it. Just like understanding of the Schroedinger Wave Equation is completely unnecessary when you are building a solar water heater. <br><br>I still have a vision of someone somewhere wrangling equations trying to come up with a comprehensive accounting for the life process, from the quantum level on up, transforming the coordinates and pulling out those good old eigenvectors, and suddenly seeing a term drop out. Puzzling over it for a moment, the equation-wrangler suddenly has a flash of insight, sits back, and exclaims, "My god, it's chi!"<br><br>Of course, lately I've begun to wonder if in fact the universe exists purely because the math says it can... so I may be a bit loony myself.<br><br><a href=ways-of-force.html#c7343842595077971611 title="comment permalink">7/15/10, 8:55 PM</a><br><br>

I'll gladly listen to anyone who tells me to go to a used bookstore and buy books on old-fashioned technology! I've been visiting antiques and thrift stores for awhile now, and collecting non-electic versions of household tools. I've got a hand-crank eggbeater and wood drill, a kitchen gram scale, a washboard, and just today I found an old "heater" iron. Antiques stores can also house interesting books, BTW, especially older agriculture manuals and engineering textbooks.<br><br>Several of the comments today really got me thinking, and I wanted to respond to a few of them.<br><br>@Don Plummer about geothermal: Yeah, I was trying to do the same thing with the hydroelectric dam two blocks from my house. The potential energy of the water gets translated to electricity via the force of gravity, and at least some of the water in the river got its potential energy from the sun and then rained into the river, but what of the water that gushes out of the spring at the river's source? My geology gives out at this point.<br><br>@NJH about spinning ==&gt; clothing manufacture: Oh, I dunno, England in the Middle Ages successfully supported an international trade in fine wool cloth with an army of housewives wielding drop spindles. IIRC, it took sixteen drop spindles, or four walking wheels once they were invented, to keep one weaver supplied. Handloom technology has improved since then, but interestingly so has handspinning technology -- we now have treadle wheels, which can replace about six drop spindles. As for the most efficient way to make clothes, that is complicated by the fact that no two humans are exactly the same shape. Efficiency of time and cloth can be achieved by making clothing out of (almost) nothing but rectangles and triangles. (The biggest non-rectangle is the crotch seam on a pair of pants.) But then your fashion choices are rather limited.<br><br><a href=ways-of-force.html#c3527955386396957042 title="comment permalink">7/15/10, 9:19 PM</a><br><br>

In a nutshell, where does ESP/PK fit into these various concepts of energy/matter?<br><br>I have hunches about this riddle (experience-derived, let me assure readers) but no settled answers. It seems that even amongst the small, scattered community of people who take the subject really seriously, and do their best to approach and investigate it with sober rationally, there are few firm answers to its mysteries. Elusiveness seems to be an inherent part of the nature of this beast.<br><br>Yet having been a visiting occasional member of K J Batcheldor’s last sitter-group, in Exeter, Devon, Britain, until his death in 1988, I have the sort of certainty which can only come from repeated, close-up actual experience of a thing: that psi-phenomena (ESP/PK; paranormalities) are as real as anything else in the real world; both the information-handling aspect and the physical-manipulation aspect (with inevitable integral energy-manipulations, one supposes). When you’ve sat with three colleagues on a table, with everyone’s feet off the ground, and felt and seen the table rise up into the air without explicable agency, it changes your scepticism about these things conclusively. And that was just one of very many comparable experiences that were elicited by Ken’s method of investigation, refined by him and helpers in his groups over a quarter-century of methodical research.<br><br>As I say, JM, I’ve no hard, fanatically-held views about the explanation for these anomalous phenomena. But neither have I any doubt that they’re real. Ken always struck me as a good example of the sort of low-profile, lonely-furrow wizard of the sort you’re now promoting – a person of knowledge and practical skills. And his subject – psi – seems to me to have been one of the particular concerns of shamans, wizards, sorcerers, druids, etc., since time out of mind.

Couldn't see the point myself then, but now all is clear master! This weeks post was very eloquently written for such a complex matter - well done, I'm much impressed!<br><br>To me available energy is a finite thing. Take for example the energy inherent in the natural systems on the planet. As the human population expands and consumes more energy, the remaining flora and fauna contracts in both range and number. It is simply because when the sun's energy is collected by plants, it is taken by humans for their own purposes. We also maintain a broken nutrient cycle in Industrial societies which increases that loss of energy so we use more energy every year than what is replaced. Eventually there has to be a crunch time and then a correction. I only hope that some of the natural systems survive so that the ecosystem can repair itself.<br><br>When people claim that energy is infinite, I often think that they are walking around with their eyes closed. To me it seems that there can only be so much utilisation by humans of the naturally collected energy before a correction in the imbalance occurs.<br><br>Not being a great one for the metaphysical, I've sometimes felt that life force is actually an expression of the carrying capacity of the planet?<br><br>I'm in the process of building a low energy requiring house and one of the most important things I am doing (other than the fire rating requirements) is insulating it to conserve the energy that I do utilise. We're talking under the floors, in the walls and in the roof. Not to mention double glazing, veranda’s etc. The more I go down this path, the more I realise how simple it would be to retrofit these things into an existing timber framed and clad house. The stuff is fairly cheap too. Unfortunately though, insulation is not as sexy a topic as a split cycle air conditioner or central heating! It's interesting how many people treat these as a right and not a luxury. For me they are in the same category as driving a vehicle.<br><br>We're in the depths of winter at the moment and I'm constantly amazed by how much power is generated by the solar system even on cloudy days. The trick though with solar is to reduce your electricity consumption to match the generating capacity and not the other way around.<br><br>Maybe the human population in Industrial societies may learn this trick soon as well?<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><a href=ways-of-force.html#c8834723003233517951 title="comment permalink">7/16/10, 2:54 AM</a><br><br>

You seem to be indicating here that this concept of universal life force was still alive and well in the medieval West. Therefore, would it be accurate to say that the medievals would not have considered this concept incompatible with monotheistic religion, especially Christianity? (Your comment above on the Hebrew <i>ruach</i> would also seem to support this conclusion.)<br><br>I ask because I know of Christian friends and acquaintances who are very uncomfortable with George Lucas' Force because they associate it with Eastern mysticism and not Western religious thought.<br><br>If it is true, though, that the concept of universal life force was not dead during the Middle Ages, when did it die in the West and what caused its demise?

Parts of an ecosystem will “discover” that they can profit not by making the most of their share, but by stealing as much as they can of the shares of others. For instance, canopy trees fall into this category. There is a particular featherless biped that often does the same, but for the life of me I cant remember what its called....<br><br>We head into muddier waters now.<br><br>Chi – Spirit – Energy<br>My sense is that the concept of chi creates confusion because many acts that encourage good chi tend to work on both planes at once. So in casual discussion people unintentionally mix up which referent the word they use is pointing at.<br><br>Joel<br>“The more mystical of my friends tend to insist that information follows the same rules as energy”<br>False. JMG in another comment seems to have implied a third “ruleset” for energy. I disagree with this ( though not vehemently) because matter and energy are part of the same game. <br><br>Information on the other hand, emerges from the interplay of the parts of that energy-matter universe and plays a completely different game. Its hard to describe succinctly, but information cannot exist without matter, and matter cannot exist without producing information. Neither has primacy over the other. It may sound peculiar (it certainly does to me ) but “life” is a type of matter that has discovered how to utilise information (or the other way around maybe – I cant decide). Sometimes I think of the intersection between the “universes” as as being like the “two faces make a candlestick” optical illusion. We can see one or the other at any time, but never both at once.<br><br>Bill<br>“physical terminology is wrongly applied to metaphysical concepts”<br>“"orange-ness" is a property of matter but is not the same as matter. “<br>In my head I add another category: “paraphysical”. Ideas constructed with paraphysical concepts can often be understood meaningfully on both the material and informational planes (or spheres.. or universes..) (Hmmm: looking at the sentence I just wrote, it seems that now I have to come up with another word that means “a definition that is an example of itself”...) Bother!<br><br>Bill<br>“Of course, lately I've begun to wonder if in fact the universe exists purely because the math says it can”<br><br>Nearly: the math that says the universe can exist, exists because the universe can exist. Nobody can write a theory that models their non-existent universe while they're in that non-existent universe. I should know because I know nobody as well as anyone else does.... <br>So, now who's looney?<br><br><a href=ways-of-force.html#c6455642042763614398 title="comment permalink">7/16/10, 4:49 AM</a><br><br>

Once you begin thinking in terms of energy flows you begin to notice some very interesting ramifications. A couple of examples:<br><br>In a superinsulated house you feel comfortable at a temperature several degrees cooler than you would expect. This is due to radiation. You radiate heat to the walls of the house at a temperature of 98 degrees or so. The walls also radiate heat to you, though at a lower temperature (the amount of heat radiated is proportional to the temperature of the thing radiating it). In a conventional (poorly insulated) house the walls are quite cold because they are losing heat rapidly to the outside so they don't radiate much heat back to you. A superinsulated house's walls are nearer to the inside ambient temperature and radiate more heat back to you, so you feel more comfortable at a lower air temperature.<br><br>Another one; a superinsulated house is designed to minimize conduction, convection, and radiation losses. This means less heating of air. Since heating air tends to dehumidify it, superinsulated houses tend to maintain a higher humidity level in winter. Higher humidity means that sinus tissue tends not to dry out and is more effective in dealing with the ever present cold and flu viruses. Hence fewer colds and greater comfort. Working with nature;s energy flows has its rewards. <br><br>On a different note; several posters have mentioned weaving and spinning as crafts to preserve. One resource to check out is the New Hampshire Weavers Guild (http://www.nhweaversguild.org/home.html). These people are doing a masterful job of preserving (and expanding!) the fabric arts. If you live in the area - join. If you don't, check it out and use it as a model for a similar organisation in your area.<br><br><a href=ways-of-force.html#c3099171306481993145 title="comment permalink">7/16/10, 10:32 AM</a><br><br>

What have been termed discrete planes clearly interact with each other to some degree, otherwise their existence would be absolutely unknown and unknowable to each other. So you can draw lines between them as discrete planes, or you can draw one big line around them and call it one universe, with different processes and phenomena having a greater or lesser degree of interaction to the point that some parts are almost invisible to others, or visible only indirectly through shared interactions with some third thing. Again, look at mainstream physics, which is at present trying to deal with the apparent fact that 90% of the matter in the universe has almost no interaction with the other 10% (which is the 10% we know about) other than via gravity. Is dark matter the stuff of a separate plane? Or is it part of one universe? It's however you chose to describe it. <br><br>Dwig -- in Odum terminology, emergy IS energy quality.

Having been involved in eco-development, organic agriculture, sustainable rural development, eco-building, permaculture and related issues for more than twenty years, working first in Germany, than in the mountains of Spain, and since 1993 in rural Mexico, I have the feeling that many things you are descibing in futurist language, are happening already (at least here in Mex., where the process of decline is well on the way).<br><br>For example: What some colleges and friends are doing with organic agriculture, inspired by soil microbiology and systems thinking, being able to reduce production costs for campesinos down to 30% in one year, while restoring the soil (in a lapse of one to three years), keeping up with harvests of a healthier and more valuable product, and this in the context of ever more erratic climate patterns and degraded landscapes, is pure magic, at least for most of the university trained agronomists, biologists, engineers and often the campesinos themselves… <br><br>Working with rather than against nature, understanding natural patterns and using/ working with them, combining ancient knowledge &amp; modern science, surely is an enormously powerful tool. One of the many a “green wizzard” will have to manage in a not so distant future.<br><br>I don´t know, if the reference to the seventies eco-tech movement is the only one we should explore. Of course, there is a lot of valuable material hidden there to be rescued … A pirated DVD series called “Appropriate Technology Sourcebook” came to me by “pure magic”, a few years ago, and many of the books mentioned in your curriculum, can be found there as PDF, actually too many for my old printer to handle, nevertheless, whenever I have some inc, paper and time, I print them out and bind them as books for future use without electricity. Those who want to explore more check out http://www.villageearth.org/pages/Appropriate_Technology/ATSourcebook/index.php - it’s an imense and valuable resource, also because many of the manuals were written for a so-called “third world” context. Maybe you will need this material soon….<br><br><a href=ways-of-force.html#c4175927679003437914 title="comment permalink">7/16/10, 7:51 PM</a><br><br>

A lot of activism that found its reflection in a political party which got well established by the mid-nineties, and in 1998 even became part of government… Many of these experiences (in those distant seventies I was still a child) shaped my thinking, they also forged my scepticism towards “movements” in general. In this context, the idea of “Green Wizzards” as a successful alternative strategy makes a lot of sense to me.<br><br>I have the feeling, that the inspiration and inpulses from the seventies got more grounded, when they were pushed back to the fringes and margins of the society. For example: The issue of emergy and energy qualitiy/ hirarchy you describe in your recent post, was pioneerd by H.T.Odum in the late sixties and early seventies (“Environment, Power and Society” 1971), but the author continued to explore this topic during the eighties and nineties, and the recent re-issue of the book (“Environment, Power and Society for the 21st century”, 2007) is, in my opinion, much more powerful than the original.<br><br>On a more practical level, the permaculture concept, pioneered in the mid-seventies, made its way from a marginal proposal promoted by an outlaw with a big ego (probably necesary to make the concept survive, and to motivate a frew bright caracters to further explore the ideas and practices, during the so called “lost period”) and stands now amongst one of the proposals and thinking tools for creative adaption for energy descent, especially since the important actualization realized by David Holmgren (“Principles and pathways beyond sustainability”, 2002).<br><br>By the way, those two books mentioned above are part of the one hundred (hopefully there will be more….) books that I hope will survive and evolve during the next two, three, four centuries (being of course part of the green-wizard-curriculum), plus a lot of other material, that I partly mention on my webpage at http://www.tierramor.org/permacultura/bibliografia.html (the selection is far from complete, comentaries are in spanish, but most of the books are in english, since you english speakers are privileged to have access to MANY MANY tools and excellent books… compared to the scarce spanish resources I have access to here in the mountains of central Mexico, you are once again with a certain advantage)<br><br>(soon to be completed)<br><br><a href=ways-of-force.html#c2265022334006213210 title="comment permalink">7/16/10, 7:56 PM</a><br><br>

Also, the creative connection and integration of different tecniques and strategies, uniquely adapted to each site, person, family, community, climate, culture etc., makes eco-tecniques much more powerful and effective, giving way to improvement, innovation and evolution. From my experience working in rural sustainability projects undes sometimes quite tight conditions, a future “green wizzard” definitely needs some design tools, which brings me back to permaculture as one of the proposals to integrate this. <br><br>By the way, I am also very critical towards the “certification-crazyness”, so present in the promotion of permaculture in the US and elsewhere. In my opinion this is a serious impediment for making this thinking and design tool available to more communities and individuals. Also, the so called “Permaculture Design Certificate Course” (in the way it is promoted in the US and other places), with its fixed curriculum and sometimes quite high costs, endangers the concept to get frozen into a state where it was in 1988, preventing further evolution and improvement. Luckily Holmgren did a lot to break through this, also we can bypass this limit here in Mexico without serious hazards/ problems with some “permaculture purists” who are still stuck in the eighties and nineties …<br><br>OK, that’s enough for now… saludos desde mexico<br>holger<br><br><a href=ways-of-force.html#c7258150693280041150 title="comment permalink">7/16/10, 7:58 PM</a><br><br>

Nearly all traditional Japanese garments are made of exactly that, with no tailoring. Not limited at all!<br><br>Librarian, you're getting into Druidry at this point. One of the Druid traditions in which I'm an initiate uses that particular fluid as the sacrament for its rituals. No kidding!<br><br>Dwig, nicely Platonic. <br><br>Njh, I've noticed that inevitably, when I point out to a fan of technology that there are economic limits on what can be done with technology, they pretend that I haven't mentioned those at all, and go on about whether their project of choice is technically feasible, which doesn't matter one hoot in a windstorm if it's not economically feasible. If you aren't willing to deal with the economic dimension, that's fine, but please admit that you're dodging the issue!<br><br>Rhisiart, I've also experienced things that tend to support the claim that mental causes can, under some very limited circumstances, have direct physical effects, and there are models for such interactions in most of the old esoteric philosophies. Still, the actual amount of energy set in motion by these processes tends to be very small -- a nudge rather than a thunderbolt -- and their practical applications, though they've long been an essential part of the classic wizard's toolkit, are rather different from those we'll be discussing here. <br><br>Robin, thank you for the links!

One of the things that make them muddy is the way that the models we use tend to shape the behavior of the thing we're modeling: classic observer effect in ecology or quantum physics, take your pick. <br><br>Don, every devout Christian on Earth in the sixteenth century believed in a life force. There's nothing anti-Christian about it; in the beliefs of the time, it was created by God (there was some argument on which day in Genesis), and the Holy Spirit was the divine <i>spiritus</i>, the life force of God himself poured out through Christ into the souls of those touched by grace. <br><br>All that got lost with the invention of modern scientific thought in the seventeenth century. The abolition of the concept of the life force was one of the central agendas of the new science of the time; they wanted to get rid of magic -- Newton was actually criticized harshly by fellow scientists for allowing action at a distance, which seemed too much like magic to them -- but in the process they basically gelded religion as well.<br><br><a href=ways-of-force.html#c2921297415990134391 title="comment permalink">7/16/10, 9:38 PM</a><br><br>

Especially most middle class Americans, who are allergic to the realization that their comfortable lifestyles are paid for by other people's impoverishment. <br><br>Darius, good. Do you know the point to those old discussions? It was whether the number was finite or infinite -- in other words, whether angels take up physical space. If you believe in angels, it's a question of some interest. <br><br>Steve, oh, granted.

That's a topic for next week. <br><br>John, good -- and thanks for the contact info. <br><br>Joel, by the same logic you could trace it back ultimately to the Big Bang, if that actually happened. <br><br>Bill, there's more to it than terminology. Novices and New Age types tend to confound the planes, to use the technical term, and assume that action on one plane will inevitably have results on others, when that generally isn't the case -- this is why the so-called "law of attraction" works so poorly. There are connections between the planes, sure, but you have to know how to make them work for you, and remembering that (for example) mental causes have physical effects only in specific circumstances, and with sharp downshifts in range and power, keeps the novice occultist from making a fool of himself or herself. <br><br>Tracy, one of these days I want to write a book on the philosophy of magic that will explain the crucial role logic, critical thinking, and common sense play in any system of occult training worth the name. I'll have a helluva time getting it published, though, because the occult presses have learned the hard way that the reading public doesn't want to be told that. <br><br>Holger, granted. Since I live in the US, my perspective is shaped and to some extent confined by what's happened here, while other things are going on elsewhere. It's good to hear that so much appropriate tech is still being practiced in Mexico and elsewhere!

However the special information that constitutes life moves in fairly robust cycles {unless it gets lost}. <br>DNA (more specifically the information in DNA) does the same with nucleotides as does BSE with proteins. As long as the information can successfully reproduce itself (cycle) then the original “stuff” can be easily discarded<br><br>Ecosystems also move in cycles that “trap, organise and discard” matter while conserving information. <br><br>Gods fascinate me because they constitute information that has successfully avoided becoming diffuse enough to become unrecognisable as “life”. Be careful of gods though. There's some tricky tricks going on there!<br><br>You can think of oil as being information about sunlight and dead plants that has become trapped where it hasn't been able to diffuse easily. <br><br>Weird huh?...

I still have Foxfire books, Whole Earth Catalogs, and a largeish bunch of books on solar design, organic gardening etc sitting on the shelves with Toynbee, Spengler and other favourites of yourself. I have owner built our past two houses with the principles there held in mind as much as possible (got excellent whole house insulation for this current house for a slab of beer) so this conversation is pleasant to read. Food preservation also becomes a habit after a while so our kitchen always has some sauerkraut, bread from our home ground wheat, etc. brewing on on the benches.<br><br>But I also have to say I get a bit sensitive to what you call confusing the planes. It is just so important for people to engage with physics. I have often been impressed at the resistance in non-scientifically trained people (and sometimes in ones who in theory are so trained) to the laws of thermodynamics. It's as if they really do _not_ want to know that there is no free lunch. That the universe does limit our options. Imagination is very fine but works inside physics not surpassing it. They perhaps could be reminded of the Zen saying: <br><br>Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water.<br>After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water.<br><br>Another way of saying there is no free lunch.<br><br><br>A couple of other points - the energy in hydrogen and helium, which makes up 98% of the ordinary matter of the universe, has colossal potential energy. The tiny amounts of deuterium in the oceans is enough for us to pack everything away underground and shift the entire planet to some other sun if we so chose. And it is unlikely that such energy will leave much nasty residue compared with first generation fission reactors.<br> <br>MisterMoose and Wordek - a couple of years ago I was gratified, as a mathematician, to read an article in New Scientist where a physics professor at MIT acknowledged what mathematicians have been telling the physics community for 100 years. It may help you with your philosophical thoughts. The universe IS mathematics. Nothing else is needed, no "solid" little balls etc. <br><br>Life on Earth will be long gone well before the sun does its end dance. It is getting hotter over time as the thermonuclear processes include higher nuclei than hydrogen in the furnace. The current estimate is that we have about 500 million years before the oceans have boiled away. Of course, for a species that bids fair to wipe itself out after less than 200,000 years, thats a practical infinity right there.<br><br><a href=ways-of-force.html#c1043387426275086198 title="comment permalink">7/17/10, 5:33 AM</a><br><br>

It's as simple as that. Energy is a quantity, power is a flow. How hot something is is energy; how fast you heat something up is power. A reservoir of water atop a mountain represents energy (potential energy, specifically), water pouring down the mountain also represents energy (kinetic energy), HOW MUCH water moving HOW FAST represents POWER. <br><br>Sunlight is power, coal is energy, coal on fire is power. <br><br>If you think of something involving energy as "per day" or "per second" or "per millenium" it is power.<br><br>Energy is the ability to do work; you might have enough energy in your battery to haul an elevator to the top floor of a skyscraper. Power represents how fast you can do the work. Your battery might take 20 years to actually GET the elevator to the top of the skyscraper.<br><br>Hence, the quantity of potential energy stored in the deuterium on the earth is totally irrelevant. What matters is how fast it can be converted to free, useable energy -- how much power can be extracted from it.<br><br>In theory you can gather enough sunlight from your roof to accomplish any amount of work you like. But how fast you can get it done is severely limited. You simply cannot collect enough sunlight from a solar panel on the roof of your car to propel it down the road at any significant speed, unless you are willing to park the car in the sun for a really long time (much more than a day; charging your solar car OVERNIGHT? Really? Did someone seriously suggest this???). There is not enough power in sunlight to accomplish this<br><br>And on an earlier comment I meant to address from Wordek -- I think you just independently discovered the rational for the Maximum Power Principle. A system capable of evolution and self-organization will not leave exploitable power laying around, it will find a way to use it. Hence it will tend towards exploiting the energy resources available to it at the maximum rate that it is capable of -- it will run at Maximum Power. This would be true of a forest in the sun, or of a society after it invents the technology necessary for fossil fuel exploitation. As I said, it is an interesting and controversial idea, both in its ecological and economic implications. Note that it is evolutionary -- it is a tendency, a direction systems will be pulled towards. It does not mean that a system will actually be running at maximum power all the time; in reality none ever will. But it proposes that this is the direction that they will be pulled, and pulled rather strongly. It is also a holistic principle, it applies at large-scales of organization, not to individual pieces -- the forest, not the individual trees. <br><br>The converse view is that a system will evolve to run at maximum EFFICIENCY. EFFICIENCY is the fraction of the potentially useable energy that you have actually converted in to work. This is not the same thing as maximum power. Maximum power suggests that work which further increase the flow of energy (such as using energy to build or grow something that will enhance the rate at which more energy can be extracted) will be favored in an autocatalytic process; work that does not increase power will lose out. <br><br>I dunno, but is is coincidental that the energy extraction industries are among our largest, most powerful, and still fastest growing economic entities?<br><br><a href=ways-of-force.html#c4315612452873949325 title="comment permalink">7/17/10, 11:54 AM</a><br><br>

The green wizard project is intended as a constructive response to a future of catabolic collapse; I'll be explaining more of the details of how that works in a future post. <br><br>Wordek, hang onto your rational mind; you'll need it if you want to practice magic. It's simply a particular set of prejudices that masquerade as rationality these days that need to be set aside. <br><br>Jason, that happened in the 1980s, and it was basically a matter of politics. In the wake of the Reagan counterrevolution, anything that had too much in common with the radical environmental thought of the previous decade got squeezed out of most venues. I remember quite a bit of talk about that at Huxley College of Environmental Studies in Bellingham, WA, where I took some classes in 1980-3; a lot of very idealistic students were having to come to grips with the fact that the careers they hoped to enter were being shut down via a cutoff of grant money, and the options open to them mostly amounted to shilling for big business. <br><br>Brian, you'll be interested to know that I run into the same issue when teaching people about magic. I can guarantee a negative reaction in nineteen students out of twenty by simply mentioning that magic is not supernatural and does not allow you to violate the laws of nature. That doesn't make it useless; it just means you can't use magic as a Rohrshach inkblot onto which to project fantasies of omnipotence.<br><br>As for hydrogen and helium, oh, granted, in the abstract they have immense amounts of energy; in practice, we can't access that energy in any direct fashion that doesn't produce a mushroom cloud. This is why fusion power has been twenty years in the future for my entire life, and will doubtless still be twenty years in the future ten million years from now when the last members of our species are outcompeted by the intelligent descendants of chipmunks. Sooner or later we need to come to terms with the fact that Clarke was wrong and technology is not what he misunderstood magic to be -- that is, it's no more omnipotent than anything else human beings do, and there are things permanently outside its reach.<br><br><a href=ways-of-force.html#c1161071026544717888 title="comment permalink">7/17/10, 11:56 AM</a><br><br>

I didn't know I was referring to this idea, but the principle that I described was just so obvious to me that I couldn't see it being controversial. Surprised therefore I am to reread your earlier comment with this in mind.<br><br>As far as I can imagine there is nothing preventing any self-replicator** running a maximum power principle along with efficiency, either simultaneously, or in a cyclic fashion (e.g. on and off seasonally) or in opportunistic instances (e.g. the felling of a neighbouring tree). <br>They arent mutually exclusive principles, and indeed while there may be waxing and waning of the importance of each in relation to the other, over time I think both would be complementary insofar as the replicator in question is concerned (especially if we assume the theoretical “ultimate goal” of a single replicator is ubiquity+)<br><br>If I were to associate the principle of efficiency with base survival and what you have described as maximum power with growth, that describes in a loose sense how the ideas are nested together in my head. <br><br>Theres more to it though and there are many other principles* in action being expressed differently depending on whether our replicators are minerals, genes, organisms or flocks. And dont forget the plethora of abstract “beasties” in the “zoo of minds” that find such a fertile environment for life within the interaction of many complex nervous systems.<br><br>And yeah, as you implied, fossil fuel is the agar of the little maximum power burst happening in our particular economic petri dish at the moment. I rather doubt that this is in any way coincidental.<br><br>(**Im using replicator in narrow and broad senses, referring to individuals as well as to sets containing all instances of a type of individual or even “ecosystems” with disparate member replicators. The context implied in the sentence should help indicate which sense is predominating)<br><br>(+Single replicators left to themselves are dumb, its the ongoing interaction between many well matched replicators in competition that produces diversity, robustness and intelligence.

My Victorian flat has a heater in the attic equipped with a fan to drive the heat <i>down</i> through vents in the twelve-foot ceiling, with the result that eighty percent of the heating bill goes into warming the ceiling.

If you have the same vehicle and the same amount of fuel, you can put a big motor in it to maximize power (0 to 60 in the shortest time, big time gas guzzler), or you can put a small motor in it to maximize efficiency (highest fuel economy, much less power). Ecosystems are much more complex than cars, but the conflict between power versus efficiency likely still applies.<br><br>To bring this all back down to earth, what does it matter to the modern-day wizard trying to work ecological magic? To my mind, this is the biggie:<br><br>If Odum's maximum power principle does apply to ecosystems, then human desires will by definition be at odds with the fundamental organizing tendencies of the ecosystem we live in. Our desires are almost always to maximize the efficiency of some select processes, frequently the production of specific things we need such as food, fuel, and fiber. The ecological energetics will constantly be pulling to divert the energy away from these efficiency-maximized subsystems into other directions. Does this mean the human endeavor is doomed? Not at all. But it means that, like any other living thing, we will continually have to WORK (in both the colloquial and thermodynamic sense) to keep the energy going where we want it and stop it from being diverted into more powerful, yet less efficient (from our perspective) paths. This is what agriculture, economics, and the natural history of every living thing are all about.<br><br>I see one rather pointed implication of all this: Systems designed to keep giving us what we want from nature without our needing to provide steady inputs of work ARE doomed to failure. Your self-weeding, self-fertilizing food forest assembled with the highest principles of permaculture will not work. If you think you can fool nature into doing the work you want for you, forget it. You will have to be out there weeding, planting, pruning, controlling pests, building fences, adjusting water, etc. etc. Let's say it again, THERE IS NO FREE LUNCH. Everyone else out there wants a chunk of your energy, and nature is more than happy to let them have it. The self-perpetuating artificial ecosystem that maximizes the output of human needs while minimizing the needs for human work is as impossible as a perpetual motion machine. <br><br>Yer gonna have to sweat, get dirty, and get sore.

Still, the label "nonphysical" is basically a confession of ignorance. People experience a range of phenomena that do not appear to have a physical basis; spirituality and magic, not to mention most martial arts, some healing practices, and quite a few other things, work with these experiences and the hard-to-define realities that underlie them; they may turn out to have a physical basis -- dark matter? -- but as yet we don't know, and it's wiser to admit that we don't know than to pretend that the phenomena don't exist because we don't understand them.<br><br>Bill (again), this is fascinating.

I find pertinent to come back to what energy is because of the discussions around chi. In physics, energy is something very different. The main reason is that physics doesn't deal with Reality, while philosophies and religions do. Chi in this prospect is outside of the realm of physics. I know that I might get in trouble with fellow scientist for saying that (I actually have), but physics is not meant to answer "why ?". Physic tackles "How ?". Ask me why an apple falls, and I can't tell. "Because of gravity" doesn't make more sense to me than "because it loves the Earth" to answer such a question question. Gravity on the other hand is a model that allows me to predict with great accuracy *how* the apple will fall. Which brings us to the fasinating discussion Bill and Wordek have been having about mathematics. Why math is such a powerful language to describe the world is a question that fascinates me. But I won't go there now.<br>Energy. Energy is a number that describes the state of a system. Not as exciting as you might have though ? Not so fast. What this means that with one number, just one, you can have a description of a system. That's exciting ! This is the core reason why thermodynamics is so elegant and powerful. You don't need to know the details of the systems to understand its fate (yes, it's fate, not its destiny). A direct consequence of the existence of such a number is that energy is meaningfull only in differences. Knowing that a rock on top of a tower is 15 "somethings" doesn't tell you much. Knowing that when it is at the bottom of the tower on the other hand, it is 45 "somethings", is enlightening. Because from the top to the bottom, there is a difference of 30 "somethings". <br>Now, work. Work is the number of "somethings" that you need to apply a force to induce movement. Aha ! Link that to what was just said, and what makes the difference between the rock at the top and the rock at the bottom of the tower is a force needed to induce movement. Since it seems good practice to hand out gold stars here (never heard of them <br>before), lets hand one to the first person who realizes that this can be summarized as "a rock on a tower can fall. A rock at the bottom of the tower just sits there". <br><br>An interesting consequence of the definition of work is that to create work, you need a difference of energy. You need a source that has more energy than the other, in order to tap the difference and create work. Otherwise, you can't have access to the number of "somethings" you need. This is exacly what our dear Archdruid kept explaining when <br>he said that what one need is "concentrated energy". As a side note, if you forgive me the wink, I will let to the reader to find out if heating a rock is work or not. <br><br>And finally, power. Power is the work done in a second. Let's go back to our rock: In order to push the rock up the tower, you need to go from 45 "somethings" to 15 "somethings". Doing so, you will move it, and therefore, you will need to apply work. At least 30 "somethings" worth of work. You can either do it slowly, one step at a time, or you can ask Billy the Bully to run up with the stone . Same work done, but Billy would do it faster. That's what power describes. In our everyday's life, oil is Billy the Bully. Most of the things that we have him do can be done with our hands. Doing without might need more of us, and will definitely be slower. But the work can be <br>done. <br><br>Sebzefrog at hotmail.fr<br><br><a href=ways-of-force.html#c5141145836180042040 title="comment permalink">7/19/10, 1:48 AM</a><br><br>

So for instance the canopy tree expresses maximal power when the opportunity arises, by adding more maximally efficient cells, twigs-leaves-branches as fast as it can. <br><br>Observe the cells as individual units moving towards maximal efficiency<br>Observe the tree as an individual unit moving towards maximal power.<br><br>The more efficient the individual cells are the less cost there is to the tree in adding more of them. So cellular efficiency makes it easier for the tree to “power up” as a whole, so to speak<br><br>If we want to optimise our theoretical vehicle in the same fashion our engineer fits 3 small engines and then when we have an opportunity to go racing we add another 10 small engines (vroom vroom). And when the race is won or lost we can drop a few engines to decompose in the leaf litter at the side of the road. Also a vehicle probably isnt the best comparison to a tree because all of the “engines” we are adding can actually generate their own fuel (and contribute enough additional fuel to drag the “unproductive” chassis along with it ). <br>So the more efficient our “leaf engines” are then the more additional resources we have left over to make even more of them quickly when the opportunity arises!<br><br>Also, assuming that what I am thinking of, and what you know as maximum power are similar enough that we arent actually talking about two different principles, there is another thing niggling in my mind. <br>All living things are affected by their environment, so periods of scarcity would drive our trees towards greater efficiency, whereas periods of plenty would mean our trees would have to grow aggressively in order to beat out their competition to resources. <br>Chuck a few million years of this kind of variation into the mix and I would suggest that both “principles” have become “latent” in our trees genetics just waiting for natural selection to encourage the expression of one or the other as climatic or other conditions change. For this perceptual shift to work we maybe need to step back a bit further, look at the forest as a whole, and see the individual trees as being selected for “death or glory” depending on how well they express either principle.<br>And of course you can replace tree with person and so on in a lot of this rant. Unfortunately I reckon the “forest of western culture” is probably in for a period of “efficiency”. <br><br>God! What a brain dump. Arent you glad you dont live in my head?!

As distinguished from the much more easily manipulated quantitative possibilities in the consumer culture. <br>I'm glad to see you resist the doom temptation so well, as I think doom is probably quite unlikely. I don't want to diminish the very probable major disruptions and difficulties ahead as fossil fuels reach their used-by dates but it's still true that there are serious concentrated energy sources available to us. Last Wednesday I was at the launch at Melbourne University of a report which gave a detailed plan for the replacement of Australia's electricity production by solar thermal and wind installations. You can download the report here. http://beyondzeroemissions.org/zero-carbon-australia-2020 . This plan deliberately used just these two proven commercial technologies to set out the process of achieving a carbon-free power supply in 10 years with a quite manageable national investment. Other technologies like geothermal were not included although there are installations here and a history in small scale going back decades. Our geology research body here estimates that the potential for geothermal here is approximately two million times our energy requirements. Feeding Japan its energy would take about 7 of the 2 million, the USA, about 40. That's if they didn't have the gumption to tap their own renewable resources. I think it's unlikely that we in Australia will do the smart thing - there is too much at stake in our massive coal and fossil gas exports. For the near future at least. But the blueprints are on the table at least.<br> The point I am trying to make is that there are very good reasons for taking out insurance for the likely mess headed our way in the form of major economic, environmental and social upheavals. But for me there has always been a deeper reason. Something to do with my soul. I built my first biodiesel plant quite a long time ago, and my reasons, on reflection, were more to do with making myself and mine free to some degree from the moral universe of the dangerous fools in Washington and the equally dangerous fools in Rhiyadh and their counterparts in Canberra, London and elsewhere. There was a lifting of some weight from my soul to put in that work, to move more freely and responsibly in the world. I think that some of the satisfaction I have felt over many years now in building our homes, growing and processing some of our food, and the other skills you laud her, is much more to do with that ars magna, the cultivation of a responsible life, than motivation by fear of the consequences of the decisions of people driven by greed and power and militant ignorance. <br><br>I think that your magic springs from that same source.<br><br><a href=ways-of-force.html#c2408420523798534115 title="comment permalink">7/19/10, 5:46 AM</a><br><br>

Well, because I had fun writing it. <br><br>Once upon a time, in a room so well insulated that it was just as if the outside didn't exist, lived a fridge and a generator. One day, the fridge came up with the idea that there was a Greater Purpose. He called it Cold Beer. By clever speaches, he gained the generator to the cause, and they started to think about how to make cold.<br><br>"With work, said the generator,we could move heat around". <br>After a second, the frige expressed his thoughts: "Huh ?" <br>The generator sighed. "We use work to move your fluids around, they liquify and evaporate, and in the process they transport heat.". This sounded straight forward enough for someone who didn't dare asking dumb questions like "how the hell would that work ?". Only remained the question of how to get that work.<br>There, the generator was on familiar ground. "Heat flows freely from one concentrated energy source to a less concentrated one. If you have two such sources, you can put a machine in between (like me) and get work out of it.<br>"But" said the fridge, "You need two sources of energy with different temperatures ? In a warm room that is all at the same temperature ? How are we going to achieve that ? <br>-By Burnin' Stuff Up!" <br>And so they did, and very soon the fridge was getting a nice cold feeling inside. <br><br>After some time, the room got a bit uncomfortable. "Why is it so warm ?" asked the fridge. <br>-Well, answered the generator, you are moving the heat inside of you outside. <br>-True, but I am very small, that shouldn't be lots of energy. Actually I am at my nominal temperature, and you are still running. What heat am I moving out ?<br>- The heat that is leaking back in because you are not perfect. <br>- But nobody is ! <br>- Not my fault" <br><br>The fridge thought more and asked: "But if I am scooping out heat that comes from the room, why is the room getting hotter and hotter?" <br>There, the generator would have blushed, had its mechanical features permitted. " Remember I told you we needed a warm source in order to get work out of the energy flow from the warm source to the cold source? <br>- Yes...<br>- Well, then the cold source should warm up, right ? <br>- Indeed. <br>- Well, the cold source is the room..." <br>Realization dawned. They didn't have a colder source. Therefore, they made a warmer source than the room in order to extract work, which was fundamental to move heat outside of the fridge. This in turn was warming up the room. <br>"Ok, stop!" yelled the fridge. The generator stopped. And the fridge, sacrificing his Cold, opened his door, bringing back the entire room and its content to equilibrium. <br><br>After a moment of silence, the fridge said:<br>"Still warm in there, isn't it ? <br>- Yup. The cold you had inside was just heat piled up outside. It went right back in. Amounts to nothing.<br>- Damn! But it is hotter than it was before.<br>- Yup: We burned up stuff. That produces heat.<br>- But we used it to make cold!<br>- Nope, we used it to move warmth around." <br><br>Terrible realization: "You mean that what we did amounts exactly to burning the stuff on the carpet ? <br>- But for the fun, the nice cold feeling inside for a while, and the<br>potential damage a fire would have caused to the carpet, yes." <br><br>Now the fridge was feeling really down. His only solution was to be Not Wrong. Cold Beer was the answer, he should never have doubted. They would endure warmth for the greater good. Full of exaltation again, the fridge shouted:<br>"Ok, start again Generator !<br>- Can't.<br>- Can't ?<br>- No: no more stuff to burn."<br><br>Silence fell.<br>After a long long time, in this dark, very hot room, the fridge came up with the concept he was missing from the beginning. That's when he thought about the Devil. The specific one, that leaves in the "details". <br><br>sebzefrog at hotmail.fr<br><br><a href=ways-of-force.html#c7441644630117212061 title="comment permalink">7/19/10, 6:41 AM</a><br><br>

It's indicative that in the Middle Ages, when "why" was a more culturally valued question than "how," saying that stones fall because they are drawn to the ground by love was a wholly acceptable claim. <br><br>Wordek, you've come very close to Bateson's definition of information here. More on this in an upcoming post!<br><br>Brian, I'm annoyed to have to take issue with you, in that the first and last sections of your comment -- the recognition that our future has nothing in common with current media fantasies of apocalypse, on the one hand, and the recognition that a good part of the reason for getting into this green wizard work has to do with what you've called "soul" -- are central to what I've been talking about all along. Still, the claim that we've got all kinds of highly concentrated energy to hand in renewable forms is a mistake. It's a very common mistake, and will become even more common as the concentrated energy resources we've actually got sunset out, but it's still a mistake. I've discussed the reasons for this in a couple of dozen posts here; the short form is that there are crippling issues of net energy and energy concentration costs that put harsh limits on how much concentrated energy we can get from nature once the fossil fuels are gone. <br><br>I know I keep hammering on this point, but it may just be the most crucial realization humanity will ever have to face: the fossil fuels, and petroleum in particular, are the most abundant, convenient, and concentrated energy sources our species will ever know, and we've burned our way through most of them already. Everything from here on will be a matter of figuring out what we can still do with a lot of diffuse heat and very small amounts of concentrated energy. That's the challenge of the ecotechnic future, and the longer we keep on chasing fantasies of limitless abundance, the more brutal the transition is going to be. <br><br>Seb, that may just be the best single metaphor for our predicament that I've seen in months. <br><br>Blue Sun, that's an excellent recommendation, though <i>A Guide for the Perplexed</i> is more than just an introduction to the nonphysical -- it's one of the better books of practical philosophy I know of. <br><br>Bill, well, actually, we can take it one step further. All these things are experiences in the minds of human beings, tightly conditioned by the cultural and biological constraints on those minds. All we can experience are mental models constructed by our brains out of the input from our sense organs and the innate patterns of thought that some of us have formalized as "logic" and "mathematics."

This does not mean that I do not understand and appreciate that this is very time consuming for you and to all the others who share their comments and ideas.

It's simply that a grasp of the fact that all we know boils down to our own mental activities keeps us from reifying those activities too simplistically. <br><br>Sophie, thanks for the link!<br><br>Cathy, I was thinking about that story when I wrote those words, interestingly enough. As for the Mayan article, the author's right that postcollapse Mayan societies got into the kind of forest polyculture she describes, which is why the boom and bust cycle that played out so spectacularly in the Lowland Classic collapse moderated thereafter. I don't think most people like to think about how much of the depopulation of the Yucatan actually happened as a result of diseases introduced by Europeans. <br><br>David, I'm amused that you helped me hammer away at the point by repeating the relevant quote twice! Still, if it helps people notice, it's a good thing. The Odum paper's been in circulation for years now, and the reaction -- even in most "green" circles -- has been uncomfortably reminiscent of the five-year-old scrunching up his eyes, plugging his ears, and chanting "I can't hear you, I can't hear you" as loud as he can. <br><br>Wendy, I'm glad you find the files useful! As for the money thing, I didn't pay money to get the Master Conserver training, so it would be morally very dubious of me to put a price on it. Insofar as this blog gives me a place to work out ideas that will later appear in book form, and now and then encourages a reader to go buy one of my books, it contributes as much toward paying my bills as it needs to.<br><br><a href=ways-of-force.html#c2880285711807763681 title="comment permalink">7/20/10, 5:40 AM</a><br><br>

I haven't been able to find the Odum book, but by rummaging around on the Web I've been able to read a lot of his papers and things about his work. So, I have an overview of the concepts. <br><br>Energy. Something I think about a lot. Being poor, mostly from a cost aspect. I'm old enough that I suppose there will always be a bit of energy around in my lifetime, but will I be able to afford it? <br><br>Especially, when people are so short sighted. Our little town has relatively cheap electricity. It's a municipal utility as we have a hydro plant that has been around for years. It used to provide all the electricity for the town, now only 30%. But, we still pay less then the next town over which is PUD. <br><br>Our city council keeps making noises about selling it. <br><br>Energy. I was going to build a solar dryer and someone gave me an electric dryer before I got around to it. Two pounds of blueberries; TWO DAYS to get them dry. Maybe if I had cut them in half... I'm thinking james and jellies, instead of the dryer.<br><br>Our town has a lot of great old brick buildings (made from a local brickyard, now gone, from local clay.) Think Hopper paintings. The building I live in is an old theatre that was built in 1903. There are so many interesting things about this building, energy wise.<br><br>It's never really uncomfortable, even in the warmest weather. There seems to be a passive air system that slowly moves through it. Makes sense when you remember that back in the old days, people smoked in theaters. But even so, the thermal mass of the building soaks up heat all summer and slowly releases it into the fall. I don't have to turn my furnace on until more then a month later then my neighbors in newer buildings.<br><br>What's really interesting is that the building faces east. It is about 170' long. I have noticed around the fall and spring solstices as the sun rises, a beam of light begins to crawl along the south wall. Day after day it advances a bit further into the building until one glorious day it lights up the back wall. And then it's gone.<br><br><a href=ways-of-force.html#c6670817609115050932 title="comment permalink">7/20/10, 11:33 AM</a><br><br>

See my answer to Bill ;) <br><br>@Bill: I am not sure that no body can answer to "what" or "why" in the way you put it. It seems to me that religions are very good at that. The fact is that because of the curse and gift of doubt, <br>I am blind to the word of faith. I can see it, but I don't "feel" it. What I know in the other hand is that some people who experiment faith without completely giving up thought can have very fascinating views about "why", "what" and the Reality. And most often there is no contradiction between the "why" and the "how" question. People usually get in trouble when they start mixing both. Be them obviously religious or be them clothing Reality with the science paradigme. <br> <br>@JMG: Indeed, in middle ages a stone fell because it loved Earth. And maybe it still does ;) I cherish this piece of knowledge because it links to a little moment of entelechia. In high school, we were told about this "belief of the Dark Ages", as a way of showing us how much brighter we were now, without all this mystical nonsense. We all laughed. And then, as the class continued, I got thinking about what my laugh meant. It lead me to think about what Reality was. And as a matter of fact, defining science as a way to answer to "how" instead of "why" is a by product of lots of thoughts, that in one way or an other are linked to this moment. <br> <br>@Librarian: <br>The background temperature of the universe (before going postal, <br>note the non capital U used for universe) is indeed 3 Kelvin, and it is actually expected to go down. It has been going down for 13 billion years, even though stars have been burning for 10 billion years because the energy they produce is minimal compared to the energy that was there in the first place. The reason for this cooling is understood as being due to the expansion of the universe. Energy stays almost the same, but the size increases, therefore the energy gets more diluted. Also, the fact that this thermal energy is very diffuse is not the reason why it can't be used. The reason it can't be used is that there is nothing cooler in the universe. If you want to make anything cooler, you have to make it. And that needs you to use energy to provide the work needed for that. I.e. in order to tap this energy you need at least as much energy as you would get out to start with. This only works in finance, you can't get away with it in physics. <br><br>I also have to disagree a bit with Mr Greer. It is somewhat of a dangerous slope because we might end up in a discussion around what we mean by "we know something". Nevertheless, in our understanding of the universe, the energy that gets out of burning stars in the form of light is very important in the formation of new stars. This light will condence hydrogen clouds and help them form new stars. This is what causes the beautiful galactic arms one can see on galaxy pictures. Nevertheless, I don't think this amounts to a cyclic behavior, as in the end all this energy is diffused into background energy. The background radiation is indeed the elephant cemetery of energy<br><br>Have to run to get my train...<br>Sebzefrog at hotmail.fr<br><br><a href=ways-of-force.html#c4937693797192022120 title="comment permalink">7/21/10, 10:28 AM</a><br><br>
