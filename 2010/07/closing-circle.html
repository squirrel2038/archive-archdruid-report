A couple of weeks ago, Energy Bulletin revisited<a href=http://www.energybulletin.net/node/53404> some predictions made in 2000 </a>by Amory Lovins, then as now one of the most vocal proponents of technological solutions to the crisis of industrial society. Under prodding by energy analyst Steve Andrews, Lovins insisted among other things that by the year 2010, hybrid and fuel cell cars would account for between half and two thirds of the cars on the road in the United States. <br><br>Lovins was completely wrong, as we now know – hybrid cars account for maybe 5% of the current US automobile fleet, and you can look through every automobile showroom in North America for a car powered by fuel cells and not find one – and it’s to Andrews’ credit that he pointed this out to Lovins at the time. What makes Lovins’ failed prediction all the more fascinating is that there was never any significant chance that it would pan out, for reasons as predictable as they were pragmatic. Hybrid cars may cost less to operate but they’re much more expensive to build than ordinary cars; fuel cell cars, while they could probably have been made for a more competitive price, could only compete in any other way if somebody had invested the trillions of dollars in infrastructure to provide them with their hydrogen fuel. In both cases economics made it impossible for either kind of car to account for more than a token fraction of the US car fleet by this year, and it makes their chances of being much more popular by 2020, or 2030, or any subsequent year not much better.<br><br>Those specific reasons can be usefully subordinated to a more general point, which is that airy optimism about technologies that haven’t yet gotten off the drawing board is not a useful response to an imminent crisis in the real world. This is a point worth keeping in mind, because airy optimism about technologies that haven’t yet gotten off the drawing board is flying thick and fast just now, especially but not only in the peak oil scene. Mention that industrial society is in deep trouble as a result of its total dependence on rapidly depleting fossil fuels, in particular, and you can count on a flurry of claims that Bussard reactors, or algal biodiesel, or fourth generation fission plants, or whatever the currently popular deus ex machina happens to be, will inevitably show up in time and save the day.<br><br>One of the things that has to be grasped to make sense of our predicament is that this isn’t going to happen. Some of the reasons that it’s not going to happen differ from case to case, though all of the examples I’ve just given happen to share the common difficulty of crippling problems with net energy. Any attempt at a large-scale solution at this point in the curve of decline faces another predictable problem, though, which was discussed back in 1973 in <i>The Limits to Growth</i>: once industrial civilization runs up against hard planetary limits, as it now has, the surplus of resources that might have permitted a large-scale solution are already fully committed to meeting existing urgent needs, and can’t be diverted to new projects on any scale without imposing crippling dislocations on an economy and a society that are already under severe strain.<br><br>The green wizardry being developed in these posts thus seeks to craft responses to the crisis of our time that don’t ignore the predictable impacts of that crisis. For this reason, we aren’t going to be exploring the sort of imaginative vaporware that fills so many discussions about our energy future these days. Instead, the curriculum I have in mind starts with a sufficiently solid grasp of ecology to understand the context of the wizardry that follows, and then moves to practical techniques that have been proven in the real world and can be put to use without lots of money or complicated technology. That may seem dowdy and uninteresting, but that’s a risk this archdruid is willing to run; if your ship has already hit a rock and is taking on water, to shift to a familiar metaphor, passing out life jackets and launching lifeboats is far less innovative and exciting than sitting around talking about some brilliantly creative new way to rescue people from a sinking boat, but it’s a good deal more likely to save lives.<br><br>All this makes a useful prologue to the subject of this week’s post. Last week we talked about energy, and explored the way that the laws of thermodynamics shape what you can and can’t do with the energy that surges through every natural system. It’s easy to make energy interesting, since there’s always the passionate hope we all retain from childhood that something might suddenly blow itself to smithereens. Even when it doesn’t, watching energy make its way down the levels of concentration toward waste heat is exciting, for most of the same reasons that watching the silver ball bouncing off the bumpers of a pinball machine is exciting.<br><br>This week is different. This week we’re going to talk about matter, the second of the three factors that move through every natural system, and matter appeals to a different childhood passion, one that most of us somehow manage to outgrow: the passion for mud. Matter is muddy. It does not behave itself. It does not do what it’s told. As you found out around the age of two, to your ineffable delight and your mother’s weary annoyance, it gets all over everything, especially when stomped. Most people discover this in childhood and then spend the rest of their lives trying to forget it, and one of the ways they forget it in modern industrial cultures is by pretending that matter acts like energy.<br><br>Get a piece of paper and a pen and I’ll show you how that works. At the top of the paper, draw a picture of Santa Claus in his sleigh, surrounded by an enormous pile of gifts, and label it "infinite material resources." In the middle, draw a picture of yourself sitting on heaps of consumer goodies; put in some twinkle dust, too, because we’ll pretend (as modern industrial societies do) that the goodies somehow got there without anybody having to work sixteen-hour days in a Third World sweatshop to produce them. Down at the bottom of the paper, draw some really exotic architecture, with a sign out in front, put up by the local Chamber of Commerce, saying "Welcome to Away." You know, Away – the mysterious place where no one’s ever been, but where stuff goes when you don’t want it around any more. Now draw one arrow going from Santa to you, and another from you to Away.<br><br>Does this picture look familiar? It should. It has the same pattern as a very simple energy flow diagram, of the sort you sketched out last week, with Santa as the energy source and Away as the diffuse background heat where all energy ends up. That sort of diagram works perfectly well with energy. It doesn’t work worth beans with any material substance, but it’s how people in modern industrial societies are taught to think about matter. <br><br>As an antidote to that habit of thinking, after you’ve drawn this diagram, I’d like to encourage you to crumple it up with extreme prejudice and throw it across the room. It would be particularly helpful if Fido is in the room with you, decides that you’ve thrown a ball for him to chase, and comes trotting eagerly back to you with the diagram in his mouth, having gnawed it playfully first and reduced it to a drool-soaked mess. At that moment, as you meet Fido’s trusting gaze and try to decide whether it’s more bother to go get a real ball for him to play with or to take the oozing object that was once your drawing and then wipe a couple of tablespoons of dog slobber off your hand, you will have learned one of the great secrets of green wizardry: matter moves in circles, especially when you don’t want it to.<br><br>That secret is crucial to keep in mind. Back in my schooldays, corporate flacks trying to head off the rising tide of popular unhappiness with what was being done to the American environment had a neat little slogan: "The solution to pollution is dilution." They were dead wrong, and because this slogan got put into practice far too often, some people and a much greater number of other living things ended up just plain dead. Dilute an environmental toxin all you want, and it’s a safe bet that a food chain somewhere will concentrate it right back up for you and serve it on your plate for breakfast. It’s hard to think of anything more dilute than the strontium-90 dust that was blasted into the upper atmosphere by nuclear testing and scattered around the globe by high-level winds; that didn’t keep it from building up to dangerous levels in cow’s milk, and shortly thereafter, in children’s bones.<br><br>A similar difficulty afflicts the delusion that we can put something completely outside the biosphere and make it stay there. Proponents of nuclear power who don’t simply dodge the issue of radioactive waste altogether treat this as a minor issue. It’s not a minor issue; it’s the most critical of half a dozen disastrous flaws in the shopworn 1950s-era fantasy of limitless nuclear power still being retailed by a minority among us. A nuclear fission reactor, any nuclear fission reactor, produces wastes so lethal they have to be isolated from the rest of existence for a quarter of a million years – that’s fifty times as long as all of recorded history, in case you were wondering. In theory, containing high-level nuclear waste is possible; in theory, it’s equally possible to drill for oil in deep waters without blowing your drilling platform and eleven men to kingdom come and flooding the Gulf of Mexico with tens of millions of gallons of crude oil.<br><br>In the real world, by contrast, it’s as certain as anything can be that sooner or later, things go wrong. Despite the best intentions and the most optimistic handwaving, in a hundred years, or a thousand, or ten thousand, by accident or malice or the sheer cussedness of nature, that waste is going to leak out into the biosphere, and once that happens, anyone and anything that comes into contact with even a few milligrams of it will suffer a painful and lingering death. The more nuclear power we generate, the more of this ghastly gift we’ll be stockpiling up for the people of the future. If one of the basic concepts of morality is that each of us ought to leave the world a better place for those that come after us, there must be some sort of gold medal for selfish malignity in store for the notion that, to power our current civilization a little longer, we’re justified in making life shorter and more miserable for people whose distant ancestors haven’t even been born yet.<br><br>This extreme case illustrates a basic rule of green wizardry: there is no such place as Away. You can throw matter out the front door all you want, but it will inevitably circle around while you’re not looking and come trotting up the back stairs. There’s a great deal of Mysticism Lite these days that talks about how wonderful it is that the universe moves in circles; it’s true enough that matter moves in circles, though energy and information generally don’t, but it’s not always wonderful. If you recognize matter’s habits and work with them, you can get it to do some impressive things as it follows its rounds, but if you aren’t watching it closely, it can just as easily sneak up behind you and clobber you.<br><br>The trick of making matter circle in a way that’s helpful to you is twofold. The first half is figuring out every possible way it might circle; the second is to make sure that as it follows each of those pathways, it goes through transformations significant enough to make it harmless. I hope I won’t offend anyone’s delicate sensibilities here by using human feces as an example. The way we handle our feces in most American communities is frankly bizarre; we defecate in fresh drinking water, for heaven’s sake, and then flush it down a pipe without the least thought of where it’s going. Where it’s going, most of the time, is into a river, a lake, or the ocean, and even after sewage treatment, you can be sure that most of what’s in your bowel movements is going to land in the biosphere as is, because mushing feces up in water and then dumping some chlorine into the resulting mess doesn’t change them enough to matter.<br><br>Consider the alternative of a composting toilet and a backyard garden. Instead of dumping feces into drinking water, you feed them to hungry thermophilic bacteria. When the bacteria get through with the result, you put the compost into the middle of your main compost pile, where it feeds a more diverse ecosystem of microbes, worms, insects, fungi, and the like. When they’re done with it, you dig the completely transformed compost into your garden, and soil organisms and the roots of your garden plants have at it. When you pick an ear of corn from your garden, some of the nutrients in the corn got there by way of your toilet, but you don’t have to worry about that. The pathogenic bacteria that make feces dangerous to human beings, having grown up in the sheltered setting of your bowels, don’t survive long in the Darwinian environment of a composting toilet, and any last stragglers get mopped up in the even more ruthless ecosystem of the compost pile. <br><br>In the same way, the inedible parts of garden vegetables can be put into the compost pile or, better still, fed to chickens or rabbits, whose feces can be added to the compost pile, so that plant parasites and diseases have less opportunity to ride the cycle back to the plants in the garden. You can cycle other parts of your household waste stream into the same cycle; alternatively, if you need to isolate some part of the waste stream from the rest of it – for example, if somebody in the house is ill and you don’t want to cycle their wastes into your garden soil, or if you want to collect and concentrate urine as a rich source of fertilizer – you can construct a separate cycle that takes the separate waste stream in a different direction, and subject it to different transformations, so that whatever cycles back around to you is a resource rather than a problem.<br><br>This logic can be applied to every part of the Green Wizard’s work. Not everything can be transformed in this way; one of the essential boundaries of appropriate tech, in fact, is the boundary between the kinds of matter you can change with the tools you have on hand, and the kinds you can’t, and if you can’t change it into something safe, it’s a bad idea to produce it in the first place. It really is that simple. So, my apprentice wizards, you have three mystic maxims to contemplate:<br><br><i>Matter moves in circles, especially when you don’t want it to;<br><br>There is no such place as Away;<br><br>If you can’t transform it, don’t produce it.</i><br><br>Aside from that, for this week’s homework, I’d like to ask those of my readers who are pursuing the green wizardry project to replace the pulpy mass Fido’s been chewing for the last fifteen minutes with something less soggy and more accurate. Take one material item or substance you currently get rid of, and figure out, as exactly as you can, where it actually goes once it leaves your possession. Don’t cheat yourself by choosing something you already know about, and don’t settle for abstractions; with the internet at your fingertips, it takes only a modest amount of work to find out which landfill gets your garbage, which river has to cope with your sewage, and so on. Your ultimate goal is to trace your chosen item or substance all the way back around to your own front door – for example, by tracing your plastic bottles to a particular landfill, the polymerizers in the bottles to the groundwater in a particular valley, the groundwater to a particular river, and the river to the particular coastal waters where the local fishing fleet caught the fresh cod you’re about to have for dinner.<br><br>This may be an unsettling experience. I apologize for that, but it can’t be helped. One of the few effective immunizations against the sort of airy optimism critiqued toward the beginning of this post, and in another way a little later on, is to spend time wrestling with the muddy, material details of our collective predicament. If your wizardry is going to amount to more than incantations that make people feel better about themselves while their society consumes its own future, it needs to get into the nitty gritty of the work – first with the mind, then with the hands. We’ll pursue one more piece of basic theory next week before proceeding to the first hands-on projects.

Mainly I'd been thinking about it because of the issue of recycling. Most of the materials accepted for recycling here are actually shipped out of state as near as I could tell. <br><br>Dumpsters go in the local landfill, which they've begun drilling to collect the gas/methane/whatever-it-is. In theory landfills don't leach into the groundwater, but I expect there is leaching that ends up in the aquifer and/or river at least in some dilute manner. Sewage is treated and dumped in the river, which eventually ends up in the Missouri which flows into the Mississippi. Storm drains aren't treated at all and empty directly into the river, so any contaminants on the streets and anything people pour down the storm drains ends up in the river.<br><br>One of the other commentors mentioned used oil on the roads- I remember when the rural areas would actually spray the dirt/gravel roads with oil to keep the dust down.<br><br>The most insidious 'away' I can think of is plastic. There are big plastic gyres in the oceans and the stuff doesn't disappear, it just gets broken down into smaller and smaller bits, consumed by smaller and smaller organisms. Which obviously get consumed up the food chain again.<br><br>It's incredibly sobering, and in a way rather frightening because it means changing not just the way one lives but the way one thinks. (It can be eye-opening to realize just how many tasks one does daily, without thinking, that involve plastic.)<br><br>Your comments on nuclear waste and its longevity and the inevitability of "waste containment failure" are things I've thought (and said) before when people ask why I'm opposed to nuclear anything.

(2) It is small. (3) It is cheap. (4) It is light. (5) It can be built very quickly. (6) It is very flexible in purpose. (7) Very little development will be required. It will use off-the-shelf components. (8) The reactor is in the study phase. It is not being built now. On the other hand a practical reactor can be distinguished by the following characteristics: (1) It is being built now. (2) It is behind schedule. (3) It requires an immense amount of development on apparently trivial items. (4) It is very expensive. (5) It takes a long time to build because of its engineering development problems. (6) It is large. (7) It is heavy. (8) It is complicated.</i><br><br>Admiral Rickover was a fascinating, controversial character. Although he was largely responsible for the creation of practical nuclear power plants, he had this to say about nuclear power when testifying to Congress: <i>I'll be philosophical. Until about two billion years ago, it was impossible to have any life on earth; that is, there was so much radiation on earth you couldn't have any life — fish or anything. Gradually, about two billion years ago, the amount of radiation on this planet—and probably in the entire system—reduced and made it possible for some form of life to begin... Now when we go back to using nuclear power, we are creating something which nature tried to destroy to make life possible... Every time you produce radiation, you produce something that has a certain half-life, in some cases for billions of years. I think the human race is going to wreck itself, and it is important that we get control of this horrible force and try to eliminate it... I do not believe that nuclear power is worth it if it creates radiation. Then you might ask me why do I have nuclear powered ships. That is a necessary evil. I would sink them all.</i><br><br><a href=#c1141546592327721691 title="comment permalink">7/22/10, 9:54 AM</a><br><br>

One of the challenges of being a Green Wizard will be just how observant we are of how things come around. It might be useful for Green Wizard students to have in their library some examples of how to spot Unintended Consequences, or at least recognize the kind of thinking that leads to them. Two books come to mind. The first is "Inviting Disaster: Lessons From the Edge of Technology", by James R. Chiles. The second is "Why Things Bite Back: Technology and the Revenge of Unintended Consequences" by Edward Tenner.

I’ve chosen to analyze our rubbish, which is a single bag each week of mostly floor sweepings and some packaging. Following the fate of Particle X, which let’s say is a dried up bit of Play-Doh my daughter dropped, I find that this and the rest of the non-recyclable rubbish is burned in a facility 2 miles away to generate electricity, which of course generates heat, emissions and ash. As the air pattern here is west to east, I’m guessing Nova Scotia eventually ends up with our exhaust, and some small bit of Particle X. The ash is hauled 2 more miles away to a landfill, where it is capped, and the leachate is collected in under drains, then treated in settling ponds by cattails (according to the facility’s website) and finally discharged into a brook which empties into the harbor. So whatever microscopic bits of Particle X survive that journey come to rest on the sea floor in the bay, and then eventually on my kitchen table in the form of a lobster dinner. Any bits that pass though me end up in the bay again via the municipal sewerage plant, and find their way back to me in a different lobster, and the cycle continues. The surprising thing to me is how small a distance is covered in this circle. It’s highly local (except for the emissions of course) which to me seems fairer than making our waste someone else’s problem.<br><br><a href=#c8047457907962586216 title="comment permalink">7/22/10, 11:40 AM</a><br><br>

Your comment that "A nuclear fission reactor, any nuclear fission reactor, produces wastes so lethal they have to be isolated from the rest of existence for a quarter of a million years – that’s fifty times as long as all of recorded history, in case you were wondering," is something that "everybody knows" that turns out to be mistaken. <br><br>The high level nuclear waste from spent fission reactors is composed of a mixture of radioactive elements, some with short half-lives, some with medium half-lives, and some with long half-lives. The short half-life stuff decays quickly, the medium half-life stuff decays over decades, and so the material remains pretty dangerous. However, after about five hundred years (and let me acknowledge that this is a long time - it's just not thousands, or millions, or billions of years), the short and medium half-life material has all decayed away, with the result that all that is left is the long half life stuff like plutonium, some uranium, etc. <br><br>Now, the nature of radioactivity is that if something is highly radioactive, then it decays away fast. If its radioactivity lasts for millions of years, then it can't possibly be highly radioactive. The result is that after five hundred years, the "high level nuclear waste" is about as radioactive as the ore that was dug out of the ground in the first place, and can reasonably be returned to the ground (in controlled ways) with no more expectation that it will be a health hazard than the uranium ore that is already in the ground in various places around the world.<br><br>James Howard Kunstler actually got this one right in his book "The Long Emergency," where he notes (page 143) that "[i]t takes five hundred years for the spent, stored waste of a nuclear reactor to decay to the point at whi8ch it is only as dangerous as naturally occurring uranium ore."<br><br><a href=#c4505390097011414427 title="comment permalink">7/22/10, 12:01 PM</a><br><br>

I'll have to check into it.<br><br>Tiago, of course nukes are going to be built; the fact that building them is an appallingly bad idea isn't going to slow that down. As for the net energy issue, as I've pointed out repeatedly, cost is a workable proxy measure for EROEI, and no nation on earth has been able to sustain a nuclear power program without massive government subsidies. That's not what happens when an energy technology has a significant positive net energy. <br><br>Kevin, excellent. You get today's gold star. <br><br>Lucid, only part of the energy that you radiate while sweating comes back to you in the kinetic energy of the raindrops. Much of it radiates out into space, where it becomes part of that 3 degrees above absolute zero that's the current background heat of the cosmos. In a complex dissipative system like the earth's biosphere, some energy gets cycled back and even concentrated, but there's always a steady loss to entropy, and sooner or later all of it vanishes into low-grade heat. <br><br>Roy, Rickover's worth reading -- much more so than today's crop of nuclear cheerleaders.

A few weeks before the Green Wizardry school commenced, I'd been fantasizing about moving to Maryland in hopes you'd accept an apprentice... you can imagine my satisfaction when the School began. <br>Completing the assignments is surprisingly satisfying: although I think I already know about energy generation, for instance, completing my simple drawings of sun to human, to chicken, to soil&amp; microbe &amp; automobile has generated a much heightened awareness of energy discharge &amp; a sort of experience of the glowing complex richness we're part of. Just thinking about the cycle of the waste I produce, while disheartening at best &amp; horrifying at worst, incites me to contemplating increasingly responsible practice. I expect actually completing the exercise will be hundred folds more powerful. <br>Re composting toilets: a plug here for humanure, the term coined by the excellent pioneer Joseph Jenkins, and his book by the same name. He makes the point that composting toilets, which collect feces (generally not urine, I believe)and compost it in the toilet reservoir, are bulky, expensive to produce in both energetic &amp; $ terms, and unnecessary. Collecting feces &amp; urine in a bucket &amp; then composting<br>it separately is safe, efficient, &amp; very, very inexpensive in every way, with the possible exception of<br>delicate sensibility, where it can be quite expensive. The basic information is available online, but the book goes into detail exploring &amp; contrasting the possible microbial cycles &amp; energy use we set up when using a flush toilet, an outhouse, a composting toilet and a humanure system. I use a charming victorian commode chair for the purpose- it's a carved wooden straight back chair with a comfy hole in the seat and panels from leg to leg that hide the bucket underneath. When I started using it, I was mainly concerned with possible offensive odors &amp; alarming my activist friends &amp; house-mates, already alarmed by my ideas &amp; subsequent fumbling practice of disengagement &amp; independence from cultural/corporate hegemony as the only meaningful, responsible action we can take in the face of dwindling resources &amp; ecological ravage. WELL. The true &amp; <br>final test of my concern was establishing the system in my home &amp; inviting my friends to find it- with a pretty pillow covering the seat, no one discovered the almost full commode- not by eye, ear or nose! <br>The compost produced from humanure is fast &amp; powerful- our vegetables &amp; soil-dwellers have never been happier. <br>Again, thankyou for your Teaching, sir- although 'thankyou' hardly covers the gratitude &amp; respect I feel for what you're giving us.<br><br><a href=#c8043484328577026352 title="comment permalink">7/22/10, 1:00 PM</a><br><br>

You get an A on this lesson. <br><br>KAP, thorium reactors are one of the pieces of vaporware I discussed in this post. Since nobody's using them, and the only people talking about them are trying to promote them, it's easy to make them look great. Mind you, I'm sure they'll be tried; we'll see people trying everything from algal biodiesel to perpetual motion in the next couple of decades. I just hope we survive the inevitable unwelcome surprises. <br><br>David, you need to check your facts. Plutonium-239, for example, is generally considered highly dangerous due to its radiation output (as well as the fact that it's one of the most toxic metals in existence), and it has a half-life of 24,110 years. Furthermore, most of the radioisotopes in high-level waste decay into other radioisotopes, some with short half-lives, some with longer ones, so assuming that fast isotopes just burn out quickly and go inert doesn't even begin to address the situation. <br><br>What makes high-level waste so dangerous is that it's not a single thing; it's a cocktail of isotopes cascading down complex decay chains, and for a very long time there are new radioisotopes being produced at nearly the same rate that old ones are going inert. Multiply that by the 12,000 metric tons of high-level waste the world's nuclear industry produces every year, and you have a massive problem that nuclear proponents are doing their level best to evade. <br><br>Daughter, thanks for the link. The "immaculate conception" was why I added Santa Claus and twinkle dust to the diagram Fido's been chewing on; it's less central to the point I was trying to make than where things go, but you're right that it has plenty of importance on its own account.<br><br><a href=#c2271488639915825800 title="comment permalink">7/22/10, 1:17 PM</a><br><br>

You're right that new radioisotopes are produced as decay products, but this doesn't change the main conclusion that I outlined. I omitted that point for conciseness, not because I was unaware of it. <br><br>The chemical toxicity of plutonium is also an issue, but all of the heavy metals are toxic. My main point was that after five hundred years, the radioactive cocktail of high level nuclear waste has decayed to the point where it's radioactivity (and its rate of production of radioactive decay products) is similar to that of raw uranium ore. This is an important fact to know (and very few people know it) as we consider what to do about the nuclear waste that is indeed a disposal problem.<br><br>I don't want to minimize the dangers of nuclear power, but simply to correct one highly exaggerated claim of the environmental movement (of which I am a card carrying member), that high level nuclear waste remains "highly radioactive for thousands of years." As a physicist (with no connection to the nuclear industry, incidentally), I know that this is simply impossible.

Sunlight hits a tree. The tree uses the sunlight to make leaves and more layers of wood. The tree is cut down using a chainsaw, so there are inputs of gas and oil to run the chainsaw, plus the fuels used to run the factory to make the saw. Sunlight also hits the plants used to feed the people who make the saw and who cut the wood (or the animals the workers eat). The wood is cut and stacked, using more energy from people who have eaten plants (or animals that eat plants) that use sunlight to create edible fruits and vegetables. <br><br>The wood is loaded into our woodstove in the winter. A good deal of the energy radiates into the house as heat and is retained (The house is pretty well insulated.). Some dissipates into the outdoors through cracks and the windowpanes (Since the house is not perfectly insulated and sealed, and even double-paned windows let some heat escape.). Part goes up the chimney as waste heat and escapes into the atmosphere.<br><br>Week 2 homework - We have a septic tank system. We eat food, then we poop into the toilet. The poop goes into the septic tank, where part of it breaks down and flows out into the septic tank field. This effluent eventually finds its way into the ground water. The groundwater eventually becomes a spring, which becomes a creek, which flows into the South River.

I know the plants over the leach lines are happy! But I am diverting some of the pee as "tunnel offerings" to get rid of the gopher in the veggies... fingers crossed!<br><br>One of the things I’m more aware of, as I read all these posts, is the growing overall system ie: how each time I add something to my “manual system” (go off store-bought or machine), I then have to continue to <b>maintain</b> that piece, as well as all the other pieces I’ve got. For example, I now have the chickens to maintain, as well as the garden, berry patches, compost, and all the manual house chores… and having just got a good sturdy bike (3-speed from the 70’s), I have to add in daily rides to build my stamina and balance so I can bike to the grocery. All of this means that my ability to attend to anything outside of the ol’ homestead (such as my freelance jobs, my friends – all of whom live 1 hr+ away) is reduced… And the time it takes to add a new bit to the system (the chickens’ pen is still much too temporary) makes me realize part of responsible homesteading is having a sense of how much one can maintain. I wonder how you‘all do it!! :-} Of course, maintenance is not my forte... I think I’m gonna someday write a book, ‘The AbsentMinded Farmer”… might be kind of short. :-}<br><br>Today, while on a reading break from wood chopping, I found two quotes from Wendell Berry (his essay “Think Little” in “A Continuous Harmony”) that to me are very appropriate:<br><i>Without a complex knowledge of one’s place and without the faithfulness to one’s place on which such knowledge depends, it is inevitable that the place will be used carelessly, and eventually destroyed. Without such knowledge and faithfulness, moreover, the culture of a country will be superficial and decorative, functional only insofar as it may be a symbol of prestige, the affectation of an elite or “in” group.<br><br>…If we are to hope to correct our abuses of each other and of other races and of our land, and if our effort to correct these abuses is to be more than a political fad that will in the long run be only another form of abuse, then we are going to have to go far beyond public protest and political action. We are going to have to rebuild the substance and the integrity of private life in this country. We are going to have to gather up the fragments of knowledge and responsibility that we have parceled out to the bureaus and the corporations and the specialists, and we are going to have to put those fragments back together again in our own minds and in our families and households and neighborhoods...We need persons and households that do not have to wait upon organizations but can make necessary changes in themselves, on their own.</i><br><br>Sounds like Green Wizardry! It’s a great essay (and book!) Always a lot to chew on.<br><br><a href=#c1938508724780688996 title="comment permalink">7/22/10, 5:18 PM</a><br><br>

In return, the comfrey jolts with new growth, which I chop down and feed to my chickens. My chickens then make beautiful, nutritious eggs and litter fallen oak leaves, which accumulatin downslope of their coop after thorough scratching and manuring.

Not just a little bit wrong, either; for example, because decay chains of other isotopes in high level waste steadily produce plutonium 239, the number of curies of Pu-239 in a given amount of reactor waste continues to <i>increase</i> for at least the first 10,000 years after the waste is produced. (The source for this is D. Ford et al., <i>The Nuclear Fuel Cycle</i>, MIT Press, 1975.) I've found nothing that supports your claims; that being the case, I think you're simply shoveling smoke.<br><br>Sophie, would you be willing to scan or copy those booklets and have them made available on the Cultural Conservers website? They're well out of copyright and sound very worth getting back into circulation. As for Seymour, all his books are first-rate -- his <i>The Self-Sufficient Gardener</i> is one of the first books I turn to when I need to figure something out about the garden. <br><br>Adrian, nicely traced. If you can find a book on ocean ecology the nitrogen cycle in the sea should be detailed there. <br><br>Anne, once the forum's up and running I hope to have an entire section there for people to exchange hints on how to "use it up, wear it out, make it do or do without." It's an important part of the work, and I probably have as much to learn as anybody!<br><br>Houyhnhnm, "no brighter future" doesn't mean no livable future. I remind myself of that when things look very grim. <br><br>Susan, nicely done. A composting toilet of some kind is a very good thing to do, but we'll be covering a lot of other ways to turn waste of various kinds into resources. <br><br>DIYer, nice. Still, the strategy here is probably to argue that high level waste only needs to be isolated for 500 years, then insist that this can be done, even though it probably can't. Something about wastes that will be around long enough to poison species that haven't even evolved yet spooks people -- for good reason! -- and getting past that is essential if the misguided attempt to revive the nuclear industry in the US is going to get any traction. <br><br>Petro, thank you. <br><br>Cathy, you've touched on one of the most loaded issues in all this. When you do something for yourself, it's not being done for you by somebody else working sixteen-hour days in a Third World sweatshop for 12 cents an hour, so you start to confront just how much labor it takes to maintain your lifestyle. It's humbling. As for Wendell Berry, his stuff is great!

Our Green Wizard some centuries hence would refer to it when coming upon a site from our civilization. This would be an exercise in risk management. Come upon an old refinery two centuries from now? Well, if the grimoire had basic pictures and some sort of list of what was hazardous and what just looked scary, our Green Wizard could be of use in a salvage operation, advising about reclamation or at least giving whatever potentate who rules that area (I'm sure in a nice communal setting where all opinions are deeply cherished, etc., etc.) some realistic advice of what it once was.<br><br>For instance, let's take the biggest bogeyman of the post-1945 era - nuclear installations. This being my gig, I can speak to it with some knowledge. Our grimoires might include basic plant layout, a description of the spent fuel pools and dry cask storage. It would cover low level waste, high level waste, uranium, plutonium, etc. It might contain some examples, such as the fact that there are measureable amounts of plutonium in Tokyo from Chinese nuke tests and life goes on fairly well. A discussion of the low risks associated with mild radiation vs. the well-characterized hazards associated with used fuel rods could come in handy when advising whether to use a well or enter a "forbidden zone."<br><br>Risk management may be key. Fear itself can make people ill, sort of a reverse placebo effect. This has been documented in Ukraine near the Chornobyl site, where people who were not exposed to anything above background radiation are ill with many vague symptoms and they are sure it is from the disaster site. Knowing when to worry is very important to planning. Treating everything as a major hazard won't be an option - we aren't going to have the resources to go to DEFCON 1 every time our Green Wizard descendants come upon an industrial building.<br><br>Advice: When compiling these grimoires, get nuclear plant locations and basic plant designs on paper. Get basic engineering and radiation safety info in it (not scaremongering, but do some real work compiling work from real studies - not editorials in newspapers). Also, keep an eye on developments. As things crater, see what mitigation efforts get taken. Write it down - how was the fuel secured? Was it buried? Was the containment dome sealed? Etc. Those of us that will fight the long fight to preserve some semblance of the industrial world, we may come up with ideas about smaller footprint reactors, new waste treatment ideas, etc. Keep an eye on our work so you can write it all down.<br><br>Also, I would like to second John, above where he said:<br><br>@John: "...green wizards will need to develop, along with appropriate technology, is a set of strategies to change or circumvent the fossilized rules in place that prevent us from deploying said technology..."<br><br>As a number of you Go Gandalf (or maybe Go Radagast is more appropriate, as opposed to Going Galt), there is one key thing you can do - get your local plant or maybe the NRC to commit to putting down plant and waste basics on long-life archival paper. This should be a relatively easy political maneuver. Have those records committed to various libraries. Could come in handy.<br><br><a href=#c2518873371876782864 title="comment permalink">7/22/10, 6:37 PM</a><br><br>

I also found this, dated 1979, from "Radioactive waste: A technical solution?". Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists: 12–18:<br><br> Hannes Alfvén, Nobel laureate in physics, described the as yet unsolved dilemma of high-level radioactive waste management: "The problem is how to keep radioactive waste in storage until it decays after hundreds of thousands of years. The geologic deposit must be absolutely reliable as the quantities of poison are tremendous. It is very difficult to satisfy these requirements for the simple reason that we have had no practical experience with such a long term project. Moreover permanently guarded storage requires a society with unprecedented stability."<br><br> But actually, even if the deadliest waste did last for a mere 500 years, does it matter any more than 5000 or 50,000 years would? We humans can't even manage run-of-the-mill pollution problems in our own time, nor cap a runaway oil well without dumping millions of tons of additional toxins into the ocean besides the oil itself. We argue for weeks over whether desperate, chronically unemployed people should get a few months more help after spending trillions on bailouts ond war. Does anyone seriously believe that we could successfully manage a nuclear waste dump for even a few decades, let alone centuries, without inviting disaster?<br><br><a href=#c2021021945737007854 title="comment permalink">7/22/10, 8:38 PM</a><br><br>

That's another example of how to make matter's habit of circling around work to your benefit. <br><br>Flagg, this sounds like something to which you could contribute. Once the forum's up and running, perhaps you'd like to put something together on the parts of "When to Worry" where you have specialized knowledge, and others can add to it. <br><br>Edde, it's certainly something that can be overused and misused. What intrigues me is that some people, at least, have worked out ways to use it on a small scale in their own gardens, and are getting good results; that's something that deserves attention and further experimentation. <br><br>Bill, one of the reasons I want people to get the ecology books is so they can learn about nutrient cycles. That's better studied from a book, or in the physical presence of a teacher, than via essays on a blog. As for plutonium, that seems about right -- it's a potent alpha emitter, meaning that once you inhale it, it starts throwing whole helium nuclei at your lung tissue, with predictably bad effects on the cells, and of course it's also one of the worst heavy metal poisons, which doesn't help. <br><br>BlackDove, those parallel the references I've seen. Of course you're right; it's even odds that, in the real world, a nuclear waste dump would start springing leaks within a fairly short time. The point of stressing the quarter of a million years is simply that it makes it a lot harder to ignore the brutal absurdity of the whole nuclear agenda. <br><br>DaShui, one of the other problems with nuclear power is that it produces very little net energy. Think of the amount of diesel fuel and other energy that has to go into mining the ore, manufacturing the fuel rods, building and maintaining the reactor, etc., etc., and it becomes clear why no nation has had a nuclear program without massive subsidies. Nuclear power is basically a roundabout way of burning fossil fuels to produce energy; as the fossil fuels run out, I don't expect the nuclear programs to survive long.<br><br><a href=#c3306921735491578482 title="comment permalink">7/22/10, 9:50 PM</a><br><br>

When I feel the questioner is open to learning something a little deeper about recycling, I suggest that they think about the object in question as its component materials. A glass bottle, or aluminum can, or cardboard box are all easy to comprehend, as they are predominantly made of one material. Invariably, the item they're wondering about is made of multiple materials — for example the ubiquitous Tetrapak container (used for soy milk, juice boxes, soup broth, etc.). I tell them to tear the item a bit, whereupon they can see paper, plastic and aluminum layers bonded together. The light begins to go on a bit, as they realize that trying to separate materials that have been designed to stay together might not be that simple. <br><br>A corollary of the maxim might be something along the lines of: <i>The more materials an item is composed of, the more difficult it is to transform it.</i><br><br>(And Tetrapak containers aren't even that difficult an example, as Tetrapak the company has been quite diligent about trying to promote the recycling (actually, downcycling) of their containers around the world. With enough focused attention, the three component materials can be separated and retrieved. Many other multi-material items are impractical to separate.)<br><br><a href=#c484011514563311519 title="comment permalink">7/23/10, 1:27 AM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c1389172954650832766></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/03387155725622960662 rel=nofollow>x2fer</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>The second thought is a longer one about the linearity vs. circularity of matter.<br><br>JMG's main point about the way matter cycles is an extremely important concept to keep in mind. While it complicates his point, it's also important to recognize the ways in which matter is effectively linear. <br><br>One way to think about the distinction between the two is to consider atoms vs. molecules. The obvious example is fossil fuels, the ultimate background for this entire blog.<br><br>Atoms, since they cannot normally be created or destroyed, behave circularly. An atom of carbon in some prehistoric carbon dioxide, which was taken up by a plant and became part of its structure, which died and fell to the bottom of a lake and decomposed, which was covered by layers of mud and silt and converted by temperature and pressure into natural gas (methane), which worked its way into a pocket where it was drilled and piped to a furnace, which was burned in air, and which finally became part of more carbon dioxide, obviously cycles through the environment.<br><br>However, molecules often behave linearly. The aforementioned methane molecule, once found and piped to a furnace, ceases to exist once it has been burned. The methane, and the energy it carries, are transformed into carbon dioxide, water and waste heat, leaving us with at least one predicament.<br><br>Matter behaves linearly because it can change form over time. It doesn't disappear — it changes shape, often with a dissipation of energy.<br><br>If I might return to Tetrapak containers here (since I've chosen them as my vehicle for this week's exercise in in-depth learning) the use and "recycling" of the containers is effectively a one-way ticket to oblivion. There was once a tree (that provided "ecosystem services" such as filtering air &amp; water, providing shade, etc.) that was chopped down and pulped to make the paper for the carton, but the recycling process weakens some of the fibers in the paper, so Tetrapak doesn't want to use that recycled fiber and instead uses more trees. The recycled fiber is "downcycled" into newsprint or less demanding uses such as toilet paper, which is then downcycled into sewage which we are learning becomes a mass of nutrients in some river and ocean. So although the atoms are all circulating, the organism of the tree is lost, at least for a few human lifetimes, and the molecules of cellulose which supported the tree and Tetrapak container are degraded in such a way that they no longer provide the rigidity that made them useful.<br><br>It's even worse for the plastic layers, as they once again involve methane, which is converted to plastic, which upon being ground up for "recycling" loses its ability to preserve and protect liquids, and so instead is typically burned as fuel and becomes in the best case, carbon dioxide, water and waste heat, but likely contributes to some toxic byproducts as well.<br><br>Another way circularity vs. linearity plays out is in differences in time-scales. Matter typically cycles over long time-scales, while it behaves linearly over shorter times, often in time periods that humans can relate to, like weeks or years or even a lifetime. Although the matter is still around, its usefulness to humans may have disappeared. Water taken from the Ogallala aquifer doesn't go away, it's still here on Earth, it's just not available for drinking any more…<br><br>Many of the ways we're degrading our biosphere involve the ways we change the form of matter in a short time period, when its regeneration takes much, much longer.<br><br><a href=#c1389172954650832766 title="comment permalink">7/23/10, 1:27 AM</a><br><br>

What isn't immediately obvious is that the "c" in that equation, the speed of light, is a really big number. And when you square that number (multiply it by itself), it becomes a really, really, really big number. So a little bit of matter ("m") gives you a big amount of energy ("E") — the reason why nuclear explosions are so devastating. But going in the other direction, you'd need a really, really, really large amount of energy to create a tiny amount of matter, something that is effectively impossible — although Star Trek encourages us to think otherwise…<br><br><a href=#c8064775601693859135 title="comment permalink">7/23/10, 1:27 AM</a><br><br>

We spent over $100,000 in an effort to "remediate" the contaminated soil before the LUST Fund took over. Part of the remediation involved heating up the contaminated soil to vaporize the volatiles, essentially converting solid pollution into air pollution. After that, we had to obtain special permits to haul the stuff off to a landfill. The permits were expensive and required lots of interaction with the EPA and other agencies, but we thought it was worth it to be able to get rid of the problem.<br><br>So, one day, I decided to follow the covered dump trucks to the land fill to see what all that special disposal really ammounted to. Imagine my shock when I watched them dump the contaminated soil into the same landfill that everything else got dumped into! That special (expensive) EPA permitting process turned out to be a total scam. We could have just as easily have left the leaky tank in place (under a parking garage) and saved the taxpayers a ton of money.<br><br>Concerning the problem of zoning and building code enforcement re: nontraditional waste-disposal systems, I've had some experience in this area. It is possible to hide or disguise many things, and people do it all the time. I'm not advocating this, because the inspectors can make your life a living hell if they catch you, but it is possible. Some jurisdictions are much more anal than others; generally speaking, rural areas are a lot looser than the suburbs or the cities. Of course, as various city and county governments run out of money and lay off "non-essential" personnel, we may soon reach a point where there won't be any building inspections any more. <br><br>If you want to see real anarchy, imagine a society without zoning and building codes. Actually, we don't have to imagine it; we saw it in Haiti a few months ago...<br><br>But, I digress. I do have a couple questions: The Chinese have been fertilizing their crops with "night soil" for thousands of years. Have they run into any major health problems as a result of this practice, or have the bugs been pretty much wrung out of this system? Is the Western reluctance to use this method (or even municipal sewage sludge) based on anything more than the "yuck" factor, or can this be done relatively safely?<br><br><a href=#c2503241716661403743 title="comment permalink">7/23/10, 6:48 AM</a><br><br>

Or is the problem you refer to the results of those ill advised systems themselves?"<br><br>One of the ironies of chlorine treatment is that it is most effective and safest where it is least needed: in clear water. Adding it to sewage will kill most but not all bacteria and create many hazardous byproducts. Dormant cysts and eggs of roundworms will have a high survival rate. Thermophilic composting is much more effective at destroying pathogens.<br><br>The process that turns the vital chloride ion into the highly reactive chlorine radical which leads to highly stable but biologically disruptive organo-chlorines is an interesting thermodynamic lesson in itself, and a microcosm of the cheap energy predicament.<br><br>I've also thought about a blog post series on the biogeochemical cycles of various elements. (My concentration in college was animal ecology, but with a minor in chemistry.) But, yeah, maybe the books are a better place. I also find that Wikipedia, for all its faults, is usually a pretty good resource when it comes to basic technical information, and I link to it extensively in my blog. It also has the advantage of being a highly-linked central resource with name recognition. The links allow for a holistic approach to research; you can go from history to geology to ecology to all kinds of other topics on, say, a river or a town, in a logical and streamlined way. While it lasts, and with caveats in hand, I will continue to use it.<br><br>On the home front, mention of humanure composting a few weeks back brought a quick spousal veto ("We're not doing that"), but that hasn't stopped me from adding my own pee to the compost bin whenever I get the chance. I'm going to try to get my son, who's currently on a long potty-training curve, to contribute some as well. Fecal composting will have to wait until I can get geared up, which mostly involves a large purchase of straw bales for bin construction and cover material. I don't want to go about it half-a**ed, so to speak!<br><br>JMG, I will be curious to see your take on it. I personally favor the Jenkins system, which doesn't involve urine separation, integrates with and enhances standard composting, and involves very little dedicated expense or materials. The downside is that you crap in a bucket and have to haul it periodically to the compost bin. But as Joe Jenkins would say, that helps put the humility back into humus.<br><br><a href=#c8996080315488044230 title="comment permalink">7/23/10, 7:06 AM</a><br><br>

Many folks seem to think that for an alternative energy source to be viable you just need to get its EROI (energy out/energy in ratio) above 1. They seem to feel that if it gets to 1.1, then we can power our economy with it (OK I'm exaggerating a bit). That is extremely unrealistic and narrow. Our society functions now on energy sources with EROIs WAY WAY more than 1; more like 10 (maybe even 100 in the boom days of easy oil). THIS IS WHAT MAKES THEM CHEAP AND ABUNDANT! As a rough guess, you might think than an energy source with an EROI of 2 might be about 99 times as expensive as one with an EROI of 100. As JMG and others have said Sooooooooo many times, for a technology to really work in society and economy it has to be much more than just "possible." It has to be economically viable on a large scale in the long term. There is simply NO WAY IN HADES you will keep an economy running and sustain a standard of living like what we see now on energy with EROIs in the 2-4 range. Sure in theory that means we can produce "all the energy we need" (forgetting pesky limitations of material supplies, available sites, etc.) but in practice it would be far too expensive even if the practical aspects were overcome. <br><br>If nuclear power could do all the things its promoters promise, it would already be powering the world. It is economics, not regulations, that have limited its growth on a global scale. When push comes to shove, environmental concerns always get shoved aside in the face of major economic issues (How y'all likin' that new climate and energy bill? Oh right, there ain't gonna be one!).<br><br><a href=#c5977339361437014564 title="comment permalink">7/23/10, 7:43 AM</a><br><br>

The garbage used to go to an incinerator, where it was burned to produce electricity, but the problem with that was that the incinerator was in the middle of a downtown area, and people started to complain about the smell and the pollution. Personally, I liked the idea of burning the garbage more than the idea of letting it sit in a landfill for thousands of years, but I know that neither is a good option, which is why we've really worked hard to cut back on the amount of garbage we have.

Still, I've found that it works very well, as a way to help people grasp the shape of our predicament and the responses that can help with it, to treat energy as moving in straight lines and matter as moving in circles. It's also accurate at a high level of detail; what moves in a straight line in crude oil as a fuel, after all, is the chemical energy in the oil; the carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen move in circles. <br><br>Toni, that's good to hear -- sheep being a renewable resource, after all. <br><br>Pfh, that's an excellent point. I suspect you'd have a hard time getting funding for an institute to study that, though. <br><br>Don, thanks for the clarification. <br><br>Bill, all this makes it all the more idiotic that the US has been planning on putting its nuclear waste in a part of the country famous for its dust storms and wind erosion.

I'm not familiar in detail with the Chinese system, but it's very sophisticated -- to the point of cultivating a variety of duckweed in rice paddies that fixes nitrogen in the mud -- so I suspect what they do would be worth copying. <br><br>Jim, my take is that the Jenkins system is the most economical of the lot, and very likely the wave of the future, but for legal reasons it's mostly going to be used in places where building codes aren't enforced. For the time being, a commercially manufactured composting toilet will be a good bet for many people. (As soon as we have the money for a few spare parts, we'll be installing a BioLet we got by barter.) <br><br>Bill, sweet light crude from an onshore well that doesn't need to be pumped has an EROEI around 200 to 1. Nothing else in the known universe has that kind of net energy -- which, as you point out, is why nothing else will keep a civilization founded on petroleum running. <br><br>Tony, did you get the telescope at the book sale?

If you have a house with a yard, you can do pretty much everything I'll be discussing, even if you're in the middle of a city; if you have an apartment or a condo, your options will be somewhat more limited, but there's still a lot that you can do -- and it's not just limited to baby steps. Climb on board; I think you'll be pleasantly surprised where the journey takes you. <br><br>Mary, potable water's an issue. A big one, and one that can be addressed in various ways. We'll be discussing some of them down the road -- though it's encouraging to remember that the bottled water industry probably isn't going to survive long into the Great Recession. <br><br>As for electric cars, very funny.

Even for those of us who own enough land to in principle grow all of our own food, starchy calorie base like grains and tubers included, the workload piles up very fast and it becomes quite overwhelming if you are trying to be entirely self-contained. It's also an unnatural way to live. People have not normally lived as independent self-sufficient households, and I'd bet that in areas with any sort of population density at all this has virtually never been normal, even in hunter-gatherer days.<br><br>No one person needs to do everything. Living in town you might not be able to grow your own corn, millet, and potatoes. But you can do other things with the time you are not spending planting and weeding and maintaining irrigation systems and digging and threshing and building rat-proof storage and... etc. Maybe you can bind books, learn blacksmithing, build furniture, teach school, fabricate solar dehydrators, repair canning jars, make art and music, sew clothes, fix shoes, etc. etc. etc. a million little tasks that those of us out in the countryside tending the fields often won't have time for. There will still doubtless even be jobs -- sawmills, stores, transportation vehicles, etc. will all still be around, in modified forms. Nobody has to do everything so long as someone does each thing and everyone does enough. And that part has a way of sorting itself out as people identify needs (their own and others) and set about to fulfill them.<br><br><a href=#c6002919825278757492 title="comment permalink">7/23/10, 1:03 PM</a><br><br>

I feel sure you're right. The only historical example of self-sufficient households that I'm aware of were huge plantation manors owned by a small class of very wealthy ancient Romans, which were operated by their many slaves (Petronius spoofs this wealthy class in the character of the nouveau riche Trimalchio in <i>The Satyricon</i>). Even medieval baronial castles must have depended for their goods and provender on the economies of the villages that typically clustered round or near them, and on the services of the farmers and artisans who presumably dwelt there. It all comes back to John's assertion that a community, not the individual nor the isolated family, is the basic unit of human survival. <br><br>This is well for people like me and DPW and many millions of other urban dwellers who will not be receiving forty acres and a mule any time soon.

Most urban and suburban areas have some kind of community gardens where you can rent a plot. CSA's, farms, and parks with demo organic ag projects also offer opportunities ranging from work-barter to volunteer positions to full-blown internships and apprenticeships. <br><br>Getting more on the creative side, perhaps there is an elderly couple with a yard who would trade a food plot for broader gardening or landscaping duties, or with agricultural land who would rent to you. Craig's list could be your best friend in this type of endeavor. Perhaps there are abandoned or neglected parcels where some gardens or livestock would fit in. The point is there should continue to be many opportunities for the post-peak peasant or sharecropper willing to seek them out. I recommend you read <i>You Can Farm</i> by Joel Salatin. It is geared toward practical ways of making money in agriculture, but the principles can be applied to subsistence as well. His approach is frugal, low-tech, and strictly organic, and he definitely got me thinking outside the box on the whole "need to get me more land" issue.<br><br><a href=#c8221401552157925660 title="comment permalink">7/23/10, 8:48 PM</a><br><br>

Not to mention the ambulance-chasing lawyers.<br><br>Even in fiction, managing reactor waste was a problem. I recall reading a couple of the early "Space 1999" books. The story had nuclear waste sent to "graveyards" on the Moon - until a critical mass blew the Moon on a trip about the galaxy. Many SF authors posit moving dangerous manufacturing processes into Earth orbit - so that any escaping contaminants are purified, more or less, to the ion level as they are consumed on entry into the atmosphere, are blown away as cosmic dust by Solar "wind", or possibly just "go Away". The possibilities for solar power on orbiting industries strike me as quite compelling. Unfortunately, that would have been a good way to spend some of that union-pocketed money the Obamans call "stimulous". Thus I don't look for that sort of resource development any time soon.

The simple reason for this is that we have no garbage pickup. None at all.<br><br>We also don't have power, water, sewerage, stormwater drainage - pretty much every bit of infrastructure that most people don't give a second thought to - unless it stops working and then I've noticed that they get angry. As part of our low energy design house, we have supplied all of these infrastructure items and tried to keep it as simple as possible. It is difficult to achieve this as local government an various engineers always lean towards complex technological solutions. They were not very complimentary about our large worm farm (which has EPA approval) - they'd prefer to see systems with UV radiation and/or chlorine!<br><br>I'm already living in the future that some of your readers are concerned about and it's not really all that bad. <br><br>Plastic is the biggest disposal headache that I face. I generate a very small bag of it every week and have to accumulate it. I'm not excited about burning it though.<br><br>Everything else gets a second life or is fed back into the soil one way or another.<br><br>Incidentally, I read recently that the old timers use to dispose of their sewage by digging a hole and putting a small upright building over it. Australian's would call this building a "dunny". Once the hole was reasonably full, which would take quite a while as the earthworms, bacteria etc ate it and broke it down, a new hole was dug and the small building was relocated. The old hole was backfilled with a bit of soil (you don't want the excrement to be exposed for health reasons) and a fruit tree was planted in it. A very healthy orchard results from this concentration of nutrients and trace elements!<br><br>Local government regulations are a bit precious in relation to the above sort of arrangements - so I wouldn't recommend doing this in your backyard - although I personally have no problems with it. Before people comment on the contamination of the ground water, remember that half of all septic tanks leak into the ground water anyway. Also, in urban areas older in ground plumbing tends to be made from clay fired pipes and they leak or have been infiltrated by tree roots anyway. Furthermore, even larger sewers leak and sometimes collapse spectacularly.<br><br>What your friendly local treatment plant operator won't tell you is that during large storms, the sewage settling ponds become inundated with excess storm water and are actually designed to discharge into local creeks, rivers and eventually the ocean.<br><br>What you flush down the toilet does not disappear magically. It is a resource that is sadly wasted and also contaminated by industrial discharges (think heavy metals). When we could be increasing soil fertility, we are simply dumping nutrient loads into areas and environments that have not evolved to accept them.<br><br>You can only hope that one day as a society we become fully responsible for our own waste and then we will realise that waste is not waste at all, but an untapped resource.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><a href=#c7105249919833778363 title="comment permalink">7/24/10, 2:14 AM</a><br><br>

There's quite a range of "hobbies" that consist of the practice of science as an unpaid avocation -- that is, doing science the way it used to be done, and will most likely be done in the future if it's done at all. Amateur astronomy is one of them; I'm always encouraged when I hear of people getting into that. <br><br>Charley, if the scientific method is going to survive -- and it would be a shame to lose it; it's the first significant improvement in logical method since ancient Greek times -- it's going to have to be handed over to people outside the community of professional scientists, and it's also going to have to divest itself of some of the ideological baggage that has been heaped on it of late. Both of those can be done, but there's going to be quite a bit of grumbling from scientists if that happens. <br><br>Jim, true enough. Of course you know that for legal reasons I can't recommend that anyone violate their state and local health codes by using Jenkins' methods where they're not permitted by code. <br><br>DPW, you can also start making plans now to move from your current apartment to one that has more options. My wife and I lived in apartments for twenty years, and managed to find places pretty regularly where we could do some gardening, use energy efficiently, and so on. <br><br>Bill, good. We'll be talking about specialization down the road a bit. <br><br>Fern, I haven't tried that site yet, but I hope it's not that dysfunctional!<br><br>Rainman, the profession of charcoal burner used to be an ancient and honorable one, if grubby to a legendary degree. <br><br>Librarian, good. Very good. There were basically two lifestyles that were worked out in detail back in the old appropriate tech movement; the first one -- the one that everybody thinks of nowadays -- is the rural commune hippie farm, but the other is the small urban house or apartment building. All this stuff can be done in an urban setting just as well as in a rural one, and the exchange of resources you've discussed is an important part of that. <br><br>As for incantations, you're quite right that there's no such thing as garbage, but it's possible to put the matter even more strongly: the word "garbage" means "a resource nobody is smart enough to use yet." <br><br>Kevin, exactly. Cities are a form of human ecology with a long history, and under the right conditions they can be sustainable for a very, very long time -- there are cities in China and Italy that have been lively places for getting on 3000 years. Urban centers close to agricultural regions do very well by providing specialized goods and services in exchange for farm produce, and that's not going to change -- in fact, a lot of small cities that are struggling to survive right now may find themselves doing a lot better fifty or a hundred years from now, when transportation is a much dicier proposition and local production for local markets is the name of the game.<br><br>Jim, all good points.<br><br><a href=#c3494924861610920422 title="comment permalink">7/24/10, 10:55 AM</a><br><br>

This is why I advocate for composting toilets as often as I do -- turning waste into resources is an essential part of being a green wizard. <br><br>Zach, once we really start getting into the nitty gritty, nobody's going to be able to keep up -- I'll be covering months of work at a time, and pointing people to books that have even more work. Take notes, do what you can, and remember that all this is the first rough draft of a future book, so if you miss it this time around, there'll be a second chance. <br><br>Darius, there's an excellent book on using urine in gardening and agriculture; it's titled <a href=http://www.newsociety.com/bookid/3959 rel=nofollow>Liquid Gold</a>. Well worth a look. <br><br>Jean-Vivien, you clean the seat the same way you'd clean any other toilet seat, with soap and water or a biodegradable cleanser. There isn't a bowl in the usual sense; instead, there's a composting chamber. You put in a good layer of organic matter -- peat moss, shredded leaves, or what have you -- before you go, and then throw in more after every use. <br><br>Especially if you have a urine diverter or a standing urinal for guys -- and you should -- the result is relatively dry and almost odorless; you can empty out the composting chamber into your regular compost pile, hose it out, let it dry a bit, and then put in another layer of organic matter and keep using it with no trouble at all. <br><br>K, it's always on topic to watch the media wrestling with the fact that the unthinkable is happening.

Growing season is no time for me to try to get anything done. I had a couple of thoughts to share, though.<br><br>It's something I've noticed before that as soon as people start thinking about small-scale sustainable living systems or appropriate tech, the question of what to do with one's wastes become obviously important. I'm afraid the rest of the world sees this concern as a sign of an amusing idiosyncrasy if not serious OCD. But it is something we have to deal with, I just don't make a big deal abut it. I have a history of kidney stones, so am required to monitor my volume, among other things. This ends up with me in possession of a couple of liters (minimum, hopefully, but I do come up short a lot of these hot days.) So far, my solution has been to spread it around the fairly large grass areas around here I have to keep mowed. I am using it to grow grass, in other words, which I then compost for soil food. Of course, diluted about 7:1 it can be applied to any crop, but I limit it to things where the whiz won't have a chance of contacting the product, e.g., tomatoes, cucurbits, corn, etc., not root crops or leafy greens.<br><br>The thing you have to consider with a septic tank system such as I have is can the system handle the volume? If you push too much through the tank/leach field system, it will tend to flow out and eventually enter some water body somewhere. I have a system I know very little about, and won't till something goes wrong. I assume it was designed for an average family of some sort, and since I am alone, I hope to get some years out of it before needing to make any changes. Assuming I am not taxing it very hard, using it just for my own solid waste, I don't think much gets past the leach field. I hope not, anyway, as I am just a couple hundred feet from the Tallahatchie River.<br><br>I keep a couple of 5-gallon buckets full of sawdust in the barn so I can go to a humanure system in the event of an extended power failure, which would knock out my well-supplied water system. I already have to haul drinking water, as the well has gone bad and though it tests OK, and works fine for most uses, it is very hard and the color is not appealing. Anyway, I'm collecting materials for a rainwater system I hope to install in the next year.<br><br><a href=#c8777938242591715361 title="comment permalink">7/24/10, 3:00 PM</a><br><br>

By "our" I mean those of us who must depend on many elements of the remnants of the industrial civilization that we live in (productive jobs being one an element that is disapearing). I was thinking about what I would have done differently if I could go back to 20 years old, and I ended up placing myself in an eco-village most likely in another country besides the good ole' USA. I'm 30 now. I have a wife, a career, a house, and a newborn. I am now stuck because convincing the wife to drop the comfortable Western lifestyle we are living now to move to an eco-village somewhere with an infant is not going to happen. <br>My point is that even though I have a house with almost 4 acres of land there are still many aspects of modern civilization that I must participate in...rather against my will. I don't want to depend on a motorized vehicle, but there is no other option. I want to have livestock to complete a closed cycle of growing food but I'm in the city limits and can't. I want to learn how to plow with a mule but that's not going to happen. I want to amend my house with a lot of appropriate tech (wood burning stove being one example) but can't afford it right now because my house is old and everything breaks all the time. So we move in degrees. Another idea that may give you comfort is advice Dimitri Orlov gave in "Reinventing Collapse." He says it's better to be mobile when society collapses...not tied down. <br>All that being said, how important is living purely with your ideals to you? It could be that you could give up the comfortable Western lifestyle you are living and take a chance on finding your way in accordance with your idealistic world view. Look at Siddhartha Gautama. If your not willing to give up your lifestyle for your ideals than it would seem your ideals need adjusting. I know I didn't ask for the Western lifestyle. I was born into it. When I woke up I was already mired, but then maybe that's just an excuse. What I have realized is that we stay positive and do what we can. You never know what tomorrow will bring. Depression about your apartment confinement will only add to your suffering. Change your mind and reality may follow.<br><br><a href=#c7791456950410643533 title="comment permalink">7/24/10, 3:23 PM</a><br><br>

Sorry for the long post.<br><br>As far as the questions about community-scale wastewater systems and chlorine, I might have something to add. Things might have changed since I had a couple of engineering water quality classes in the 80s, but at that time, the type of treatment that uses chlorine was still pretty rare. A little background: There are three levels of treatment. Primary treatment basically just amounts to letting some of the solids settle out and flushing the liquids into the nearest "away." It's all that most communities did before the Clean Water Act in the 1970s. Back then, it literally took an act of Congress to get people to stop putting something that was basically raw sewage into our rivers and lakes.<br><br>Secondary treatment is what you have in most community systems today. That consists of designing a holding tank, or tanks, to hold the liquid fraction long enough for bacteria to work out most of the objectionable elements in the effluent. It's basically a large reaction chamber, with the reaction being a biochemical one done by bacteria. What bacteria would we use for this? Why, the very bacteria in the "solids" to begin with, so it's pretty much a self-perpetuating system if designed and implemented right. In fact, it's just a concentration in space and time of the work that those same bugs would eventually do in the environment. This system can get rid of the overwhelming majority of the sewage hazard, and as I said, was the system used in most places at the time I was studying this.<br><br>Tertiary treatment is where chlorine may or may not come into play. There is always some contamination left over at the end of secondary treatment. It's inherent in the system in which you're needing a minimal viable population of the very thing you're trying to eliminate. Usually, ending up with a small residual bacteria population, as long as kept below standards, is something that the natural processes in the receiving water can handle. In those cases where you need a cleaner effluent (e.g., another drinking water intake too close downstream) the residuals have to be eliminated. The standard engineering approach has been to kill them with chlorine. I won't go into the downsides of this as the post is already way too long. Another approach, still cutting edge when I was in school, is to use a constructed wetland to take up the last of it. Eureka, California was the pioneer in this and there should be a lot of references on their system.<br><br>So I'm sorry for the long post, but I think there are a couple of important thing for aspiring green wizards to know. First, even in our conventional systems the vast majority of the work is done by natural processes and agents. It's really quite elegant if you study it in more detail than I have been able to put here. The second is that the tertiary step is only necessary because we've taken up too much of the available space for the natural processes to work in the environment. It might point to some areas of study for design of appropriate-scaled systems in a post-decline world. Finally, I hope it answers some questions about the chlorination.<br><br><a href=#c979451016859897699 title="comment permalink">7/24/10, 3:39 PM</a><br><br>

I figure if it was necessary not to deal with the septic truck man, one could manually extract the sludge (I'm sure that would require a good bath afterwards), and compost it safely as per regular humanure handling protocols. In the interim, the septic field - for as long as it lasts - is essentially a composting toilet system, is it not?<br><br><a href=#c1592916361679490692 title="comment permalink">7/24/10, 8:52 PM</a><br><br>

How often it needs to be pumped mostly depends on the size of the tank and the volume it has to handle (flow rate.) An efficient system breaks down the solids component so that there is little residual sludge buildup, and most of the microbial breakdown occurs in the tank. (In that sense, calling it as a composting system is correct.) So the tank takes care of the primary treatment and part of secondary. The leach field takes care of the rest of secondary and tertiary.

But in a bit of déjà vu, that is exactly what this small Nebraska city aims to do. <br>Beatrice was a starting point for the Homestead Act of 1862, the federal law that handed land to pioneering farmers. Back then, the goal was to settle the West. The goal of Beatrice’s “Homestead Act of 2010,” is, in part, to replenish city coffers. <br>The calculus is simple, if counterintuitive: hand out city land now to ensure property tax revenues in the future. <br>“There are only so many ball fields a place can build,” Tobias J. Tempelmeyer, the city attorney, said the other day as he stared out at grassy lots, planted with lonely mailboxes, that the city is working to get rid of. “It really hurts having all this stuff off the tax rolls.” <br>Around the nation, cities and towns facing grim budget circumstances are grasping at unlikely — some would say desperate — means to bolster their shrunken tax bases. Like Beatrice, places like Dayton, Ohio, and Grafton, Ill., are giving away land for nominal fees or for nothing in the hope that it will boost the tax rolls and cut the lawn-mowing bills. <br>[snip]<br>Beatrice (pronounced bee-AT-russ), which sits about 40 miles south of Lincoln down a highway called the Homestead Expressway, is recognized as home to the first Homestead Act application nearly 150 years ago. That law ultimately granted 270 million acres of land in 30 states to nearly anyone who could survive on it and pay a minimal fee. <br>[snip]<br>Beatrice’s new Homestead Act is not the first to revive the land giveaway. Some tiny towns, particularly in the Great Plains, have made such offers before, mainly as a way to increase dwindling populations. But disappearing is not the fear in Beatrice, which is home to several lawn-mowing equipment manufacturers and where the population has held steady at around 12,000 for decades. <br>Instead, city officials are hoping to return some of the many lots the city has accumulated, because of unpaid taxes or flooding risks from the Big Blue River, and return them to the tax rolls. The city has not suffered gaping budget shortfalls or the property tax declines seen in some larger cities, but some large purchases and road reconstruction have been delayed, waiting for a return to flusher times. <br>If the city were to give away just a few lots — and if people were to, as required by the law, build homes on them and stay for at least three years — Beatrice would secure annual real estate taxes on them, collect money for water, electric and sewer use, and no longer pay to mow the lawns.<br>[more]<br><br><a href=#c3549629836951090908 title="comment permalink">7/26/10, 7:26 AM</a><br><br>

Like so many of the books that JMG and others are mentioning, the earlier ones are the better books. With Boy Scouts of America (BSA) handbooks here in the States, in my opinion the last truly useful book was the 7th Edition, published from 1965 until 1972. After that, starting in the mid-1970s, BSA underwent a major rethinking, in large part to bring it out of its old form and more into something that might be of interest to scouts in major cities. Merit badges all changed, and they added lots of other award mechanisms. I was a Scout at this time, and it really turned me off such that I quickly quit, and the sourness of that was so great that I never really interested my boys when the time came, nor did it attract them.<br><br>Anyway, the handbooks from that transition forward (8th edition and newer) are not nearly as useful as the earlier books.

What struck me was that, after a very good <br>explanation about how to build a biochar-maker with two paint boxes,<br>it came to the combustion part, where it explained that the best thing <br>one could burn in such a device was wood pellets.<br><br>Using wood pellets to make biochar sounds like burning few acres of <br>the neighboring forest in order to have nice salads. Processing wood <br>into wood pellets costs energy. And it is more efficient to use <br>perfectly good wood to make them in a plant than using wood scraps.<br>I thus think (but don't have any reference to back it up completely) <br>that wood pellets are an artifact of our Oil Age. <br>BTW, this is the line of thoughts we followed here when we decided <br>againts a wood pellet stove. They make more heat, for less money, but <br>we think it is because of an oil energy subsidy. <br><br>Now, beware ! I am not speaking against biochar. I am simply following <br>the line of energy and circle of matter. If instead of burning wood <br>pellets one burns his own wood scraps, or wood that comes from his<br>garden edge trimming, then we are talking. This is turning a potential <br>"waste" into something useful. The matter of the wood scraps cycles <br>once more into your household, and you might even be able to get <br>something out of the energy produced as it flows out. Or not, but in <br>both cases it is much more efficient than treating them as "waste". <br><br>About the end of the world: <br>Catching up with the posts, I saw gloom thoughts about the future of <br>mankind. I am no Seer, and won't really get there, but in gloom days, <br>it might be worth remembering this: loosing the access to infinite <br>energy also means loosing the access to the scale of damages humanity <br>can inflict to the global ecosystem. If get past the current screw up, <br>I think that humanity as a whole, even if it might live through <br>"interesting times" will manage. I always envisionned humanity as a <br>below-average kid playing with a gun. If the gun is taken away, the <br>kid might never hunt the way he could have would he grow up, but he <br>will not blow up his head neither. <br><br>About science future, and science present: <br>There are scientists working from the inside to hand science over to <br>people outside of the community. And also to change the ideological <br>bagage. More than you might suspect actually. There is more than one color in wizardry. <br>And It is also worth noting that it is not as if "the community" was that eager to follow this path...<br>On that I totally agree with your hobby horse about more people doing science as a hobby. <br><br>But enough on that: the discussion about how to save science, what <br>science is, and what "the scientists" people keep refering to are, is <br>indeed very interesting but I think off topic for now. Or at least I <br>take this as an excuse to defer to a later time a discussion that <br>would take more of my time than I have currently available. August is <br>closing up, and in France, it means holidays. Lots of things to do in <br>the house. Time to get more green in the wizard.

Me &amp; my husband sat down and talked this through a few years ago and decided to stay in our terraced house in a smallish city, rather than move into a rural community living situation. My husband is now a part-time 'urban peasant', spending many happy hours in our allotment which we are fortunate enough to have down our street. Meanwhile I recently bought small orange and lemon trees in pots which now live in our south-facing patio, and the orange tree has baby oranges and loads more blossom on. We try and eat the fresh stuff we get as we go along, and Nigel Slater's book Tender www.nigelslater.com/tender.asp is a great source of inspiration for that. We also have a wood-burner and have wood to process, but also have an offer of scraps from a local tree surgeon when we need more. <br><br>For those who don't have their own growing space look into local schemes for communal gardening or garden-sharing eg you grow stuff on part of someone's garden who can't manage it themselves and share produce with them or keep their bit tidy in exchange. Local Transition initiatives are often active in developing and promoting this kind of thing, although it isn't and doesn't have to be limited to them. If there isn't something like that going on in your area already try starting it up. Another good idea on those lines is community harvesting and use of fruit from fruit trees that are not being harvested in the area - check out www.growsheffield.com/pages/groShefAbund.html for a project that does this in a city in the UK.<br><br>I just read a thought-provoking article critiquing the Transition movement and advocating a more radical move towards local economies based on a lot simpler standard of living than we currently have in the West. Check it out on http://candobetter.org/node/1439<br><br>With respect to the book search (from two posts ago), finally got to Hay-on-Wye, didn't have long there but found a small section on Appropriate Technology and a larger section on Ecology/environment. Didn't find any of the books on the list, except 'Fundamentals of Ecology' but didn't buy that as found 'Ecology' also by E Odum, which is a simpler book aimed at a less technical audience, may be worth folk looking out for that one. It was published in 1980, but is eerily predictive of the mess we are now in as a society. Picked up various other interesting/useful books while I was at it. Looking forward to the more interactive site where we can share stuff in a more structured way.<br><br>Cheers, <br><br>Anne<br><br><a href=#c8562640828159803484 title="comment permalink">7/27/10, 2:11 PM</a><br><br>

A word might also be put in here for the books produced by a now-forgotten rival of the Boy Scouts, the Woodcraft movement founded by nature writer Ernest Thompson Seton, which had an even more nature-centered focus. <br><br>DPW, good. It's important not to let the perfect be the enemy of the possible; do what you can, with what you have, right now -- this was one of Seton's mottoes! -- and then see what other options open up for you. <br><br>Rainman, thanks for the link!<br><br>Tracy, true enough -- the first time I caught Saturn on a clear and moonless night, rings and all clearly visible, is still quite a memory. <br><br>Sophie, true! Two liter bottles with the bottoms cut off also make great mini-greenhouses for newly planted vegetables in the spring. <br><br>Seb, of course you're right; the end of the age of cheap energy also means the end of the age of easy ecocide. One of my concerns is that it may also mean the end of the age of science; it's uncomfortably true that there's only a minority of people outside the scientific community who are interested in practicing science, and a pretty fair number who might find science and scientists a convenient scapegoat when things start getting really difficult. But this might be better discussed on the forum, or in another conversation. <br><br>Pasttense, thanks for the links!<br><br>Carl, this is very good to hear. <br><br>Anne, Odum's <i>Ecology</i> is a very solid introductory textbook, so will do very nicely for this work. As for the critique of the Transition Town movement it's certainly worth a read. I'm not convinced that the author's political ideology is as useful or viable as he thinks it is, but the core point that you've stressed -- that any functional response to the crisis of the industrial world will have to involve accepting the end of abundance and a much less materially extravagant lifestyle -- is crucial.<br><br><a href=#c2409445120625124833 title="comment permalink">7/27/10, 2:50 PM</a><br><br>

I can't see anything indicating otherwise. The only difference seems to be whether your intention is to put it in the soil or use it for fuel; the actual substance seems identical. So if it is just charcoal, why does it need a fancy New-Age-ish Green-Tech name? Making charcoal from plant matter by smoldering it in an oxygen-deprived fire or oven is an ancient technology. To revise an old joke: What's the difference between Green Technology and old-fashioned technology? A couple of zeros at the end of the price. Note that this has no bearing on the value and utility of using charcoal for all these purposes; but it does smack of marketing over substance. I also share sebze's fear of forests being clearcut in the name of "green tech," especially since "biochar" on an immense scale is being promoted as a potential geoengineering "solution" to climate change. It might be Brazilian biofuels all over again. <br><br>About carbon sequestration... given that it's a safe bet that we will eventually extract most of the accessible oil from the planet, regardles of policies or movements that seek otherwise, should we really be recycling or avoiding plastics? Carbon that goes into plastic does not go into the atmosphere, and plastic that is sent to the landfill rather than recycled creates the demand to make more plastic and divert more fossil carbon from the fuel pipeline. From an atmospheric CO2 perspective, perhaps we should actually be using more plastic bottles and bags and sending them to the landfills rather than recycling them or replacing them with "greener" alternatives.<br><br><a href=#c6476929406634846986 title="comment permalink">7/28/10, 8:23 AM</a><br><br>

I first heard of biochar when I read Dr. James Hansen's (Director of NASA's Goddard Center) <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.1126 rel=nofollow>2008 paper</a> on climate change, in which he discovered, through examination of the paleo-record, that 300-350ppm CO2 is the max the climate can hold without disastrous consequences. Since we exceeded the upper limit of that around 20 years ago, that's a problem. Near the end of that paper, he proposed "biochar" as one way of sequestering CO2 (the argument being, if we didn't "char" the bio-matter, it would just decompose and give its CO2 back to the carbon cycle; charring it takes it out of that cycle for hundreds or thousands of years). Since reading about that, I've been trying to find the differences between "biochar" and plain old "charcoal", but haven't had any luck yet. Maybe you're right, and it's just the intended use that makes the distinction. Maybe it's a marketing term ("charcoal" doesn't sound quite as sexy). I'm tending to think that it really just confuses the point, if it's true that they're the same thing.<br><br><a href=#c1819411072894639239 title="comment permalink">7/28/10, 10:59 AM</a><br><br>

It is ground-up charcoal, as you say. <br><br>In any case, its use seems to make sense in wet tropical situations - situations in which the soils are subject to leaching. Evidently it provides some good CEC/adsorption surface area, and hangs onto nutrients, and is persistent in the soil for a long time.<br><br>The modern "biochar" thing got started with the discovery of the terra preta soils in the Amazon Basin and other tropical regions. These soils seem to be human-made, and are still black and fertile after all these years, vs. the usual lateritic crap. <br><br>In the colder soils of the North, where much of the nutrient capital exists in the soil anyway, vs. in the above-ground vegetation as in the tropics, I don't think there is much benefit to be had. <br><br>The only charcoal my garden (in New Hampshire) gets is the odd bit that comes in with the wood ashes I sprinkle on it from time to time...<br><br><a href=#c5028171015240763363 title="comment permalink">7/28/10, 11:15 AM</a><br><br>

I was rainman<br><br>Bill Pulliam: My understanding is that biochar is charcoal but is made by pyrolosis at around 600 degrees C, in a near oxygen-free container. It is an ancient process, perhaps 3000 years old. Biochar is used both as a soil amendment and as a fuel source. Wood gas and bio-oil are also byproducts biochar. The new technology is different from the ancient slash and char process. It is more controlled. Whether you call it charcoal or biochar is up to you. I usually refer to it as char. <br><br>The large piles of debris left over from logging operations can be used in biochar production. Other plant matter such as wild blackberry vines, grasses, vineyard and orchard trimmings can be used instead of clear-cutting forests “in the name of green tech.” <br><br>What I really like about biochar is that I can make it using low-tech hand tools and recycled materials. I call myself a “Tincanologist.” <br>I’ve included some links that I have found useful.<br>Hope the info below helps further explain biochar.<br><br>What is Biochar?<br>http://www.css.cornell.edu/faculty/lehmann/publ/PlantSoil%20300,%209-20,%202007,%20Warnock.pdf<br><br>Biochar is … a term reserved for the plant biomass derived materials contained within the black carbon (BC) continuum.
