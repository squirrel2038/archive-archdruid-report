The archetype I proposed as a model for an appropriate-technology revival in the age of peak oil – the archetype of the green wizard – comes with certain standard features in folklore and fantasy. One of them happens to be a full-blown archetype in its own right: the book of ancient and forgotten lore. Those of my readers who plan on becoming green wizards will need to provide themselves with the grimoires, literally “grammars,” of that art, and in this post I propose to explain how to do just that. Yes, it involves a quest; the details will follow in a bit.<br>
<br>
The archetype is more important than it might seem at first glance. Our time, as the media never tires of telling us, is the information age, a time when each of us can count on being besieged and bombarded by more information in an average day than most premodern people encountered in their entire lives. Now it’s important to remember that this is true only when the term “information” is assumed to mean the sort of information that comes prepackaged and preprocessed in symbolic form; the average hunter-gatherer moving through a tropical rain forest picks up more information about the world of nature through his or her senses in the course of an average day than the average resident in an industrial city receives through that channel in the course of their lives.<br>
<br>
Still, the information the hunter-gatherer receives is the sort that our nervous systems, and those of our ancestors back down the winding corridors of deep time, evolved to handle. The contemporary glut of symbolic information—words and images detached from their organic settings and used as convenient labels for mental abstractions—is quite another matter. There are certain advantages to the torrent of abstract information available to people in the industrial world these days, to be sure, but there’s also a downside, and one major part of that is a habit of shallow thinking that governs most of our interactions with the information around us.<br>
<br>
A hundred years ago, by contrast, a student pursuing a scientific or engineering degree might need half a dozen textbooks for the entire course of his studies. Every chapter, and indeed every paragraph, in each of those books would be unpacked in lectures, explored in lab work, brought up in tests and term papers, so that by the time the student graduated he had mastered everything those textbooks had to teach. That depth of study is almost unheard of nowadays, when students shoulder half a dozen huge textbooks a term, and have so little time to process any of the contents of any of them that the bleak routine of memorize, regurgitate, and forget all too often becomes the only option.<br>
<br>
Combine that with the transformation of much of American higher education into a predatory industry fueled by aggressively marketed student loans, and every bit as focused on quarterly income as any Fortune 500 corporation, and you have the collapse of our educational system sketched out in a recent and harrowing <a href=http://www.energybulletin.net/node/53342> blog post</a> by former professor Carolyn Baker. The resulting ghastly mess is problematic in just about any sense you care to contemplate, but it has a special challenge for potential green wizards, because very few people these days actually know how to study information the way that a project of this nature demands.<br>
<br>
Treat the material I’ll be covering in the weeks and months to come as a formality or a collection of hoops to jump through on the way to some nonexistent degree in green wizardry, in other words, and the result will be abject failure. If you plan on studying this material, dear reader, you need to pursue it with the same total intensity your average twelve-year-old <i>Twilight</i> fan lavishes on sparkly vampires. You need to obsess about the way an old-fashioned computer geek obsesses about obscure programming languages. You need to drench yourself in it it until it shows up in your dreams and seeps into your bones.<br>
<br>
You need to do these things because the ideas central to the old appropriate technology contradict the conventional wisdom of today’s industrial cultures at literally every point. All the things that we learnt about the world by osmosis, growing up in a society powered by cheap abundant fossil fuels and geared toward a future of perpetual progress, have to be unlearnt in order to understand and use appropriate tech. The fact that they also have to be unlearnt to make sense of the world in the wake of peak oil is also relevant, of course; it’s precisely because many of us, even in the peak oil scene, haven’t yet unlearnt them that you see so many grand plans for dealing with peak oil that assume, usually without noticing the assumption, that all the products of cheap abundant energy will be readily and continuously available in a world without cheap abundant energy.<br>
<br>
The old archetypal image of the book of ancient and forgotten lore is among the very few cultural images we’ve got of information that doesn’t belong to the read-and-forget category. Consider the <i>Necronomicon</i>, the imaginary tome of occult wisdom from half an hour before the dawn of time that plays so large a role in the horror-fantasy stories of H.P. Lovecraft. Lovecraft’s characters don’t page casually through the <i>Necronomicon</i> and then go on to the current issue of <i>People</i> magazine; they search the world and risk their lives to get mere fragments of the text to study, even though they usually end up being dragged offstage by an unearthly tentacle because the fragment they got doesn’t contain the Voorish Sign or some other bit of protective lore. <br>
<br>
Now I trust none of my readers will be dragged offstage by an unearthly tentacle, or even an earthly one, as a result of the studies I propose to offer them, but then a book “concerning the laws of death” (which is what <i>nekronomikon</i> means in Greek) is not going to be particularly useful for a student of appropriate technology. What’s needed instead is a Gaianomicon, a book “concerning the laws of Gaia” – if you will, a manual of the theory and practice of applied human ecology. Like Lovecraft’s tome, the Gaianomicon exists only in fragments, and your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to gather enough of those fragments to make a start on your education as a green wizard.<br>
<br>
I’ve made the first part of your quest easy. Back in the early 1980s, when I worked my way through the Master Conserver program in Seattle, I collected the instructional handouts from the program and stashed them in a binder for future reference. I’ve still got them all, and have scanned them into a PDF document, which you can download from<a href=http://www.greenwizardsradio.org/Master%20Conserver.pdf> this page </a>on the Green Wizards forum. Those of my readers with slow internet connections should be aware that this file is 190 pages long and comes to nearly 8 MB. The handouts cover one part of the curriculum we’ll be discussing, the part dealing with energy conservation and renewables, which will be given a more evocative name a little later in this process. <br>
<br>
I’d like to ask everyone who downloads the file, by the way, to do two favors for me. The first is to print out a copy of the whole thing on paper, and put it away somewhere tolerably safe; the second is to make sure that at least one other person who doesn’t read this blog gets a copy of the file, either electronic or printed. I don’t actually know for a fact that this is the only set of these handouts in existence, but I have yet to meet or even hear of anyone else who kept their copies, and it would be useful if this material were to get handed on to the future. Think of it as a bit of cultural conservation, of the sort I’ve mentioned several times already in these essays.<br>
<br>
That’s the first part of the quest. The second is going to be a little more challenging, though only a little. You don’t have to go hunting for the lost city of Roong in the mountains of Zarazoola on an improbable third hemisphere of this already overexplored world. Instead, you need to go to a local used book store. It needn’t be the biggest and best in your area, if your area has more than one – in fact, in my experience, you’ll be more likely to get good results by going to one of those out of the way hole-in-the-wall places where the stock doesn’t turn over too quickly and some of the books have been there for a good long time.<br>
<br>
You’re looking, of course, for books from the original appropriate technology movement of the 1970s and 1980s. There were hundreds of them back in the day, a small number from the large publishing houses of the time and a great many more from struggling presses run by individuals, or by the little nonprofit groups that created so much of appropriate tech. You may find anything from professionally bound hardbacks with dust jackets down to staplebound pamphlets with hand-sketched illustrations. You may find them in the gardening section, or in the home repair section, or in the science section, or in the nature section, or in a special section all its own labeled "Homesteading" or "Back to the Land" or something like that. (I haven’t yet found a store that labeled it "Naked Hippie Stuff," but hope springs eternal.) You may even find it jumbled up all anyhow with the general nonfiction because the proprietor of the used book store has no idea where to put it.<br>
<br>
Wherever it turns up, you’re looking for a book on organic gardening, energy conservation, renewable energy, or anything related to them, preferably one that includes hands-on projects or ecological philosophy, or some of both. If you get one of the classics – <i>The Integral Urban House, Other Homes and Garbage, Rainbook, The Book of the New Alchemists, The Food and Heat Producing Solar Greenhouse</i>, or the like – that’s good, but it’s not required. It counts just as much if you find a little staplebound pamphlet on composting, or a ragged trade paperback from a small press on building a solar oven, or an old Rodale Press hardback on insulated window coverings, or what have you.<br>
<br>
There are two points to this exercise – well, actually, two and a half. The first point is that your work with green wizardry certainly shouldn’t be limited to what one middle-aged archdruid has studied and practiced, under sometimes sharply limiting conditions, over the last thirty years or so. If you make appropriate tech part of your life – and if you intend to practice it at all, that’s pretty much what you need to do – at least a modest library of books on the subject is essential. You will develop your own personal take on appropriate tech, and your own personal style in putting it to work; the books you read and study, whether you agree with them or not, will help you start the process of bringing the take and the style into being.<br>
<br>
The second point is that many of these books are nearing the end of their useful lives. The limited budgets available to most of the appropriate tech presses meant that most of the books were printed on cheap paper and bound by whatever method cost least. If they’re going to become anything but landfill, and if the information they contain is going to find any sort of new home, somebody needs to take responsibility for making that happen and, dear reader, it might as well be you.<br>
<br>
The half point is that the appropriate tech movement, like any other movement on the fringes of the acceptable, had its own quirky culture and its own distinctive take on things. If you were learning a martial art, let’s say, an important part of your early learning curve would have to do with picking up the customs and traditions and little unspoken rituals of the art, which have nothing to do with how to block a punch and everything to do with navigating the learning process and interacting constructively with your teachers and fellow students. This remains important even when the movement no longer exists and the surviving participants have either gone on to other things or have spent the last thirty years laboring away in isolation at ideas and practices nobody else cares about; your task is harder, that’s all, and one of the few ways you can get a sense of the culture of the movement is to spend time with its writings and its material products.<br>
<br>
So that’s the second part of your quest for the fragments of the Gaianomicon. The third and final part is simpler, and those of you who are wondering why you can’t just do all your book shopping on the internet can take heart, because this part of the assignment can be done online if you like. Your task here is to get a good basic book on ecology. If at all possible, it should be a book from the late 50s, 60s or 70s, when the concept of the ecosystem was central to the field in a way that hasn’t always been the case since then; the ecosystem approach is central to the way of thinking we’ll be exploring in posts to come, and a good grounding in it will be essential.<br>
<br>
If you don’t have any previous background in the life sciences – and if what you have is what you got in American public schools, that amounts to no previous background – a book I like to recommend is a deceptively simple little volume called <i>Basic Ecology</i>, by Ralph and Mildred Buchsbaum. Originally published in 1957, it has been in print ever since, and provides a clear introduction to the ideas you’ll need in a very readable and nontechnical form. If you’ve got enough background that a serious textbook holds no terrors for you, one to get is Eugene P. Odum’s <i>Fundamentals of Ecology</i>, probably the classic statement of the ecosystem approach. There are other good books on ecology to be had, however; while you’re at the used book store, you might want to take the time to see what’s in stock.<br>
<br>
So those are your initial textbooks or, to use the archetypal metaphor with which I introduced this post, the tomes of ancient and forgotten lore you need to gather in order to begin your training as a green wizard: the Master Conserver handouts, one or more old appropriate-tech books, and a good introduction to the science of ecology with a focus on the ecosystem concept. If you already happen to have the latter two sitting on your bookshelves, and I know some of my readers do, that’s great; if not, please try to get them over the next week or so. Either way, put some time into reading them, and think about how the ideas contained in them might be applicable to the challenges of a world on the far side of peak oil. Next week we’ll start weaving some of those ideas together and exploring how the green wizardry of appropriate tech can be put to work.</div>

I'll just start it at bedtime and, barring server timeouts, etc., it'll be waiting for me in the morning. For task #2, we have several well-read volumes of the sort you mention in our library already, but I may do your exercise anyway just to see what I find here in the backwoods (where the naked hippies started wearing clothes decades ago, alas). I'd wager that for task #3 the 8 years I spent in The House That Odum Built have that covered? <br><br>Given my academic background, I do forget that not every formal student of "ecology" has received a real ecosystem-focused perspective. Even a lot of "ecosystem" talk that happens is really more about "communities" -- the collection of plants and animals, but without as much attention to the equally important collection of atmospheric, hydrological, geological, edaphic, biogeochemical, energetic, etc. components of the ecosystem. The ecosystem approach is not extinct in Academia, fortunately; it is thriving still in some places such as Athens, Fort Collins, Gainesville, Ithaca, Lawrence, and up on that redundancy known as Table Mesa (as much as true scholarship is able to endure in the present-day academic climate anywhere on earth). <br><br>Since we're starting with your master conserver notes, I'll give a link to a 6-year-old blog post of mine (sigh, yes, I have been blogging for 6 years, I was an early adopter...).

A couple of thoughts. <br><br>If you find some pamphlet that is fragile and falling apart, you might scan it on your printer onto high rag content, low acid paper. I know my printer scans and copies onto whatever paper I put in it. Do it now before the cost of paper and ink get even higher. That PDF file you were talking about. Might be good to print it on such paper. I'm going to.<br><br>Thursdays are the day I close my shop and meet my 88 year old Dad out at the local Rez to have lunch with him and watch him gamble away my inheritance. He rides a bus in from 90 miles away to do this. Seriously, it's his money and I don't care what he does with it. It's nice to see him out with his friends, having a good time. And, he seems unusually lucky. <br><br>Before and after my time with Dad, I get out and 'beat the brush' for stock. I always look for stuff on appropriate technology. I would have passed on old Ecology texts, but will now add them to my "looking for" list. <br><br>As far as my store goes, I'm now very tempted to add a shelf of "Naked Hippie Stuff." It tickles my sense of the absurd. I have also been thinking about putting up a few signs that I am willing to "trade books for produce." <br><br>In closing I want to mention that I price my books to the low end of Amazon. I figure they are my primary competition. I take into account condition and shipping. What I've noticed is my books tend to be less expensive than the other three used book dealers in town. Yup. Four used book dealers in our littler burg. Not exactly Hay on Wye, but we're getting there. I think there is another book dealer here. I hope they chime in.

Many claim to understand the theory of natural selection that governs all life on Earth for example, but few are prepared to accept that the "harmony" and "balance" currently peddled by some utopians is actually based on a fierce and frequently fatal struggle for life:<br><br>“We behold the face of nature bright with gladness, we often see superabundance of food; we do not see or we forget, that the birds which are idly singing round us mostly live on insects or seeds, and are thus constantly destroying life; or we forget how largely these songsters, or their eggs, or their nestlings, are destroyed by birds and beasts of prey; we do not always bear in mind, that, though food may be now superabundant, it is not so at all seasons of each recurring year.” Charles Darwin<br><br>If you want to understand ecology, you need to understand how important death is. In fact, populations generally appear sustainable because of death, and what applies to the rest of nature must surely applies to us.

Yet unless it be thoroughly engrained in the mind, the whole economy of nature, with every fact on distribution, rarity, abundance, extinction, and variation, will be dimly seen or quite misunderstood.” Charles Darwin<br><br>Our behaviour thus far has been a predictable consequence of natural selection and so will be the results.<br><br>Kind regards,<br><br>Matthew<br><br><a href=seeking-gaianomicon.html#c3986302482591812767 title="comment permalink">7/8/10, 12:41 AM</a><br><br>

A wizard treasures the knowledge of the crafts, and puts them in context. This is why I think JMG starts his green wizard path with a broad pannel of crafts and ideas (adequate technology) and puts them in the even broader context of ecology. <br> <br>Nevertheless, this path directed toward the making of green wizards can also lead to the making of master craftmen. Some of the readers probably are following a craftman path. Some of us might later on pick on one of the crafts presented and concentrate on them. What really counts there is the pursuit of mastery. And in the end, I really think that the future, any future, needs Master Craftmen as much as Green Wizards. <br> The danger I see is the same that I banged myself on with respect to public education. The prime goal of the general education was to give a base of knowledge to everyone, that would be a training in clear thinking, useful for bakers as well as for teachers. It became perverted into valuing knowledge and ideas over craftmanship. I have <br>seen more than enough students who liked a craft and became so called "failures" because they were after a degree. Them, or their families, refused to take up learning a craft, even though it is well known (at least in France) that there actually is lots of work for good craftmen, and very little for someone who gets out of the university with "only" a master. <br><br>This comes from what I call "the wizard in the tower" syndrome. At any time wizards are in danger of forgetting that the concepts they are dealing with need to be "grounded" to earth. That they should not be their own only justification. Failure to do so leads to the tendency to consider university professors as the pinacle of what university teaching can produce. We mistake "Professor" and "Master". The pinacle <br>of achievement is called Mastery. And we ought to remember that craftmanship also leads to mastery. Actually, the "professor" path is only one among the multiple ways to mastery.<br> <br>Therefore, please, you who might read this, who I don't know, but who is on this path at my side, please remember: follow the sacred fire, this curiosity, this energy that will help you go over the <br>difficulties that clog the way toward mastery. You don't have to become a wizard. If metal speaks to you more than the reason it melts, if a healty orchard speaks to you more than the link between bees, worms, and plums, please become a Master ironsmith or a Master gardener. <br> <br>If you had the change to meet one or two masters, you know that then, you'll still know the links between steel and fire, or between plums and bees. You will know it in your bones. <br><br>sebzefrog at hotmail.fr<br><br><a href=seeking-gaianomicon.html#c7161207556685400370 title="comment permalink">7/8/10, 1:56 AM</a><br><br>

Bill Bryson commented on this fact in his book "Down Under" which is also both an entertaining and well written book.<br><br>Can I also recommend to readers that it would be good to obtain back copies of Australian alternative magazines such as Earthgarden (which is awesome!) and Grass Roots as these are both relevant and chock full of useful information as distinct from the 100% advertisements that a lot of magazines have now become! This is relevant because we have poor soils, high temperatures, variable rainfall, and pretty much what the rest of the world is soon to experience thanks to climate wierding.<br><br>There's a copy of Basic Ecology on it's way to me and I'll read it when it turns up. <br><br>Ecological histories are also important because people tend to think of the ecology as a stable thing when in fact it is quite the opposite.

But Green Warriors I saw as being people who were sufficiently clear headed enough to grasp what is coming down the pike – that is if anybody can get a real handle on that – and who were willing to take real responsibility in their own lives to tackle the associated issues.<br> <br>Green Wizards I saw as being the next stage on, somewhat akin to wise advisors, people who had been through their own long initiation process and who were now willing to share their knowledge and experience with a wider audience. <br><br>Green Wizards I also saw as being the people concerned with moving our society towards a real and deep understanding and respect for the earth and its ecosystems.<br><br>As a biologist and ecologist Odum’s book has been a cherished possession and his systems view is critical to understanding the interconnections in nature. But ultimately, I think we need to move beyond even that to a deeper more reflective relationship with nature. However, that is probably a discussion for another day.<br><br>Curiously, some 5 to 6 or more years ago we were on a book shopping venture to Hay on Wye, the second hand bookshop capital of the world, or so it is claimed. <br><br>Such ventures are always very painful for our wallets but in one bookshop we spied a large box full of copies of Organic Gardening and Farming dating from 1959 onwards. <br><br>Practically, every copy had drawings or instructions on how to construct items ranging from greenhouses to potting tables and more.

You need to drench yourself in it it until it shows up in your dreams and seeps into your bones." That made me smile and laugh a little, thank you. I ought to laugh at myself for being so odd I suppose but it is as one of my co-workers said some time ago "When he first started working with us [programming though never taken a class in it] all I knew about him was that he dreamed in code and it's like he's always online." I have not in any way kept it a secret that I happen to program for a living and happen to do it here only because it is the clearest road forward to a certain goal that my fiancee and I are working toward though I found this path without looking for it in particular (I did not come to work here with the intention of programming for a living, I hired on originally as a temp for about a year before being hired into my current position some year and a half ago). I certainly appreciated his assistance in building a raised bed garden in the backyard of one of our friends/coworkers who let me occupy part of his yard for the purpose.<br>I have had the pleasure of discussing at length with my fiancee your writings and ways to observe the meaning of them and I am very excited to have the opportunity to see your finger pointing and the waymarks you are setting up for us to see. Last night as I set about my daily exercise of reviewing information I have gathered from the Net (dozens of books in pdf or text and gigabytes of audio and videos of lectures, instructions and exploration of ideas) and looking further I found videos of a certain Sepp Holzer from Austria during a querying of Google videos on permaculture-esque practices and I wanted to share with any who may want to observe the man and his ways a collection of links that I used to develop the image of him and his ways in my mind:<br><br>"It was only in 1995 that we leart, that our unconventional approach to agriculture could be described as Permaculture." (http://www.krameterhof.at/en/index.php?id=holzersche_permakultur)<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepp_Holzer<br>-- http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7037201501836169163&amp;hl=en&amp;emb=1#<br>-- http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=235437896615994763&amp;hl=en&amp;emb=1#<br><br>I am comforted that he did not come to his ideas by saying "I will study this thing I have heard advertised as permaculture and do what they say to do." but rather, as he has said, he 'listened and watched' and learned from the world itself. A clear mind that learned to ally himself with and channel the energies of the natural world. My own long enjoyed symbols of mind entertain the image of this man as hopping down the path from a pool of water carrying water lilies and unafraid of a certain old malevolent willow.<br><br><a href=seeking-gaianomicon.html#c7986781148692722291 title="comment permalink">7/8/10, 4:30 AM</a><br><br>

A Green Warrior is one that performs actions. Even building a bridge, or a dam, eventually has less impact than a knowledgeable elder. A warrior acts using weapons (what you use to change your opponent's mind, according to Lois McMaster Bujold) and opposes an enemy.

They have (or at least used to have when I lived in Portland, before they got gentrified out of their old location on Hawthorne) some fairly complete runs of exactly the sort of naked hippie publications you're describing. Those mags also give you a good dip in hippie culture: the idealization of traditional Third and Fourth World peoples, the religious eclecticism, the quotations from Ivan Illich and Saul Alinsky, the open-mindedness (sometimes shading over into credulity) about certain kinds of supernatural phenomena, the occasional mention of space colonies. They could save a lifelong Christian or rational materialist from a <i>faux pas</i> or two. Periodicals Paradise is in the basement of an antique store called Hollywood Reruns. So far as I've been able to discover, it has no website; there's an email address on its LibraryThing entry, but I don't know whether they do mail order at all. However, if you're in the city with a free afternoon, you can do much worse than just to go down there and browse.<br><br><a href=seeking-gaianomicon.html#c6405279170393819603 title="comment permalink">7/8/10, 8:08 AM</a><br><br>

Imagination is the most potent tool our species has, and drawing on the more evocative images of wizard, warrior, mad scientist, etc. is a good way to tap into that. <br><br>Joanhello, I can certainly second the recommendation of Powell's -- that's where I got my copy of <i>The Food And Heat Producing Solar Greenhouse</i>, among other things -- but I haven't been to the other place; I'll have to check it out next time I'm on that side of the continent. More generally, you're right about periodicals -- well worth reading, even if it does involve occasionally rolling your eyes.

Just the other day my son discovered H.P. Lovecraft, and he was asking me about ancient information. Hopefully, Lovecraft will add to my son’s a sense of adventure and illustrate the difference between the 1,700 text messages he sent last month, and wisdom collected, processed and stored over generations. <br>And I just started Vlakto Vedrals’ books on information theory. Sounds like a stretch to your essay’s topic, but information theory is especially relevant to the quest you have lined out. Information theory states that the quantity of information contained within an event is equal to inverse of the probability of that event happening – squared. The event of finding the bong water stained original manuscript of “A Guide to Naked Hippy Living” will have much more information than ordering up “Organic Gardening for Dummies” from Amazon. As with Lovecraft, the quest is part of the event, and may yield as much information as the text itself.<br>Other green wizard texts may be found in the archives of the extension services of land Grant colleges from 1930’s. These are texts from a catabolic collapse period and offer may solutions for doing more with less. If I were setting the path for the green wizard quest I would also recommend a few spiritual/philosphical texts to be added, namely Thoreau and Muir.

There may be games with mystical language, but there's not really ideology. A solar greenhouse is just a technique, it is not inherently political. <br><br>I feel that we're at a bit of an advantage here in more rural areas because people have a better knowledge base to start from. My neighbors already know a fair bit about gardening, heating with wood, animal husbandry, etc. by conventional means. Much of that knowledge, like basic understanding of how plants and animals and weather operate, will be useful even if many of the particular techniques and tools become useless. Your neighbors may chide you for using a handsaw and axe, not a chainsaw. But at least they understand about cutting, splitting, and seasoning wood. They are also still generally familiar with "old-time" food storage techniques, having seen it in their grandparents cupboards and barns as well as among their Amish, Mennonite, and Not-so-Naked Hippie neighbors. I hope that places like this will see less panic and frantic searching for The Answer and more rolling up the sleeves and putting on the boots to figure out how to deal with things. <br><br>Interesting side note -- in my lifetime it has gone from "Mom's Apple Pie" to "Grandma's Apple Pie." In other words, our generation never learned to bake a decent apple pie.<br><br><a href=seeking-gaianomicon.html#c2258245239393314230 title="comment permalink">7/8/10, 9:45 AM</a><br><br>

And it feels good to be able to say that I’m already moving forward on most of your suggestions. I can’t <b>resist</b> used bookstores, nor old books on almost any craft, including homesteading… so I have many old books of that sort. I haven’t seen anyone mention “The Mother Earth News Handbook of Homemade Power”, a small but chock-ful paperback. And a new book that I love reading is “Life in the Soil” by James Nardi – it starts with microbes and works up in size order! Love it! <br><br>And I also hope you will mention saving books in other craft areas – there was a renaissance of handcrafting in the 70’s and I have been saving all the books on embroidery, sewing, macramé, knitting/crochet, etc. – because they, too, will be needed (and I love doing all that). I’m so glad to see the next generation becoming intrigued with these skills. As I mentioned before, I have some pioneer cookbooks and ones from the twenties.<br><br><br><i>Bookbinding and low-tech printing are high on the list of skills I'd like to see preserved.</i><br>I’m with you on that!! I actually had an old handcranked newspaper printing press (heavier than a piano) and a cabinet of fonts, but due to life changes, hand to give it up – but it went to some enthused youngsters (and I kept two drawers of font and all my printing inks/tools). Have no fear: Portland OR has a great hand printing center, and you can get a degree in bookarts from OR College of Arts. I also have books on those related skills, since I’ve done bookarts for decades. A lovely one from mcmxlviii (1928?) “Wood Engraving” by R.J. Beedham – and let’s not forget all the herbals and home remedies! Those have to be used carefully (some old folk remedies are deadly) but have much of value.<br><br>@JoanHello <i>...a store called Periodicals Paradise</i> – oh, my – memory lane! I almost used to <i>live</i> there… one of the cheapest places to get the older art magazines (which were very expensive new) but I couldn’t resist the Organic gardening and Mother Earth News and others… glad to hear it at least survived its move from Hawthorne.

Thank you so much for your vision.<br><br>As a high school librarian, I carefully weed around the practical skills books on topics such as building and cooking with solar ovens, weaving, and alternative energies, even though, sadly enough, these are not in our curriculum. I know where the Naked Hippie Books section in our fabulous local used book store is, even though it is not labeled as such. I have picked up books on practical skills over the years at used book sales, used book stores, thrift shops, and garage sales -- one of my first about 17 years ago was a copy of The Integral Urban House in great condition. And now I know why. I don't know if I'm up to being a Green Wizard, but perhaps I can be a Green Librarian.<br><br>Thanks for all you do here!<br>Laney<br><br><a href=seeking-gaianomicon.html#c8050560151631085518 title="comment permalink">7/8/10, 1:47 PM</a><br><br>

Unfortunately, I don't really have much of a way to get my hands dirty at this point though. I chose to move to a relatively expensive condo development (renting) to be 3 blocks from my work and to experiment with living in a relatively small space (600sqft) for two people. The building itself is incredibly efficient and I really don't have to drive my car other than for big/heavy/long errands. My appropriate tech effort right now is learning to cook from scratch with farmer's market foods and minimal gadgets and changing my mindset about needs (clothes, tech, etc.)...and staying healthy...mentally and physically, while everything around crumbles bit by bit.<br><br>At some point (&lt;2 years) I'd like to find a job in a more rural part of the country, but for now, I'm going to live as best I can while minimizing my carbon feet in the city. Living in a small(er) space now should also help if/when we get a chance to head to a smaller town, though it will in no way prepare me for the cultural dynamics... Still, I see building and living in a super-insulated, low-tech 500 sqft cabin as a nice next step towards more redundant sufficiency (along with a larger barn/work area and garden room). I'd do that now, but unfortunately, land anywhere near where I currently work is still over $100K for anything decent and would entail a 1.5hr commute, so that dream is a little ways away. There are places where I could afford to buy a more standard home to retrofit, but again, commute time...and then there's the likelihood of further RE collapse and not wanting that albatross of debt...<br><br>So, for now I have to live in the skin I inhabit and see what comes, but I'll still enjoy learning through others and playing house so to speak ;) Maybe I'll find another way to get involved; habitat for humanity, or something else to build practical skills (pun intended).<br><br>And yes, I do have a bit of me that fears the feral aspects of city if the Long Descent has a couple unexpected and rather abrupt dropoffs, but all life involves risks I guess.<br><br><a href=seeking-gaianomicon.html#c8692170499125014311 title="comment permalink">7/8/10, 2:16 PM</a><br><br>

The PDF has been downloaded but I need to get paper &amp; ink to print it. I would not normally print out a document that long, but there is a reason to print it in this case.<br><br>I have a quantity of sustainability type books already although generally of a more recent vintage than the ones you recommend, and having bought some of this type of book on Amazon (secondhand as much as possible), I get recommendations from Amazon on other similar stuff to buy, which is how I heard about the Long Descent. So it is worth checking out Amazon for this kind of book.<br><br>I will go on the used bookstore quest in the near future. I will actually be passing by Hay-on-Wye in a couple of weeks time - so you have just given me a reason to spend a few hours going round the bookshops there, even though the house is already over-run with books!<br><br>Second-hand booksellers often do a lot of their business from on-line orders nowadays so it is worth checking out what is around on-line.<br><br>Charity shops and charity stalls at events can also be good places to pick up interesting second-hand books at very cheap prices. I got a great hardback guide to Alternative Medicine for 50 pence on a charity stall at an event I was at last weekend.<br><br>One final point - a lot of information about ecology, permaculture gardening etc relates to specific bio-regions so it is important to get information that is relevant to the kind of area you live in. For example the original permaculture books were written from an Australian perspective and although the basic principles can be applied anywhere a lot of the specifics are not so relevant. So I have books on permaculture that have been written by UK authors from a UK perspective which is more relevant to me.<br><br>It would be useful to have a place where a list of useful books could be posted and which people could add to and check out on an ongoing basis, which doesn't really work in a blog and comments format - maybe we need a web resource in addition to this blog which could be used in that way.<br><br><a href=seeking-gaianomicon.html#c6412595332356576726 title="comment permalink">7/8/10, 2:48 PM</a><br><br>

If they are caged, you can do that easily by rapping the cage frames a few times. This shakes the pollen from the stamens down to the pistil, and you get pollination. Some folks like to attend to each flower cluster individually, gently thumping it a few times, but from experience (raising tomatoes in the home greenhouse in the winter) I have discovered that vibrating the whole plant now and then does just fine.<br><br><a href=seeking-gaianomicon.html#c5514768598301092577 title="comment permalink">7/8/10, 5:26 PM</a><br><br>

One of which is...<br>Handy Farm Devices and how to make them by Rolfe Cobleigh 1910<br><a href=http://onetbsd.de/survival/Handy_Farm_Devices.pdf rel=nofollow>Handy Farm Devices</a><br><br>It's about 4.7mb<br>Here is the introduction<br><br>By Way of Introduction<br>SUCCESS comes to the man who so works that his efforts will bring the most and the best results -- not to the man who simply works hard. It is the know-how, things-to-do-with and economy that count. Labor-saving machinery has revolutionized many a trade and industry. It has made farming an industry and a science of possibilities undreamed of and unattainable a hundred years ago. But it is not enough for the modern farm to be equipped with the best tools and machinery that shops and factories turn out, to know how to use them and keep them in repair. There are many handy devices, not made in any factory and not sold in any store, that every intelligent man can make himself, which save money and labor and time. Inventive men are constantly contriving simple but valuable things to meet the needs of their own practical experience. We are all the time hunting after and gathering these ideas. Now we are putting a lot of the best ones into this book. We are trying, by words and pictures, to explain clearly just how to make each device. Everything described is tried and practical. Some are old, many are new, all are good for the purpose intended. They represent the practical, successful experience of farmers and other wide-awake workers all over the United States.<br><br>This book is broader than its title. The overflow of good measure includes a valuable chapter on the steel square and its uses. Nowhere else has this subject been handled in a way so easily understood, with confusing mathematics cut out. We especially commend this chapter to our readers. We also present some good house and barn plans, that will be appreciated by those who contemplate building.<br><br>In addition to the direct benefit to be derived from doing what the book tells how to do, we have in mind the larger purpose of education toward putting more thought into our work and doing what we have to do the easiest, the cheapest and the quickest way.

And they are. Very often, I find out that it encounters or creates lots of enthusiasm and I am asked about books to learn more about them. Inevitably, I end up killing tinkerbell, by saying that yes, at some points, one has to deal with the tough reality of learning calculus. <br>I had other experiences like that, but the most archetypal was about this student told me he was very eager to do a PhD with us, but that computing was out of question. It is like wanting to be an ironsmith and saying that well, loud sounds bother you, and by the way, you can't bear high temperatures. And if we could please keep liftiing heavy hammers to a minimum, that would do just fine.<br>The point I want to make here is that *all* path come with hills and stones. The Green Wizard one too, and I don't expect our dear Archdruid to be one to cheat us on that. At some point, things will get tough, really. Failure, difficulties, and the desire to give up <br>are part of the path.<br>The reason I can tell is that I have been there. And actually get there on a regular basis. I therefore wanted to share my experience on 3 things that can help get over it. <br>First, drawing on the "sacred fire" that made you start on this journey. The Green Wizard archetype is a very potent one in my opinion, and it could do just fine. Remember the elation you felt when you decided to go there. Feed it each time you can with the unique feeling of a success you shaped yourself. And force yourself to remember it when things are tough. <br>Second, remember that you are not alone. Look around the posts here, and you'll see people who manage to live off-grid, who cut wood without a chainsaw, who are iron smith or very good gardners. They did it. Therefore it is possible. And remember an interesting mathematical fact. Someone ten steps ahead, made ten times what you did. Someone doing one steps made infinitely more than one who did not.<br>Third, remember that you are not alone. It means in failure also. And that failing something does not mean one is a failure. A well analyzed failure can teach more than an un-analysed success.<br>This is why I entitled my post "Lets share our failures", as a concreete, applicable thing we can do. Practically, I don't know how the greenwizard website will be designed, but I think it should hold a <br>"failed attempts" section, where the discussion is about analysing failures and aiming at making them successes. (BTW, dear Archdruid, I am interested enough to volunteer some of my time to help organize and animate this. If you find it worth a shoot, please contact me)<br><br>Sebzefrog at hotmail.fr<br><br><a href=seeking-gaianomicon.html#c5678220334739401701 title="comment permalink">7/9/10, 3:29 AM</a><br><br>

Because systems develop their own languages any bit of informaion only has the meanings given to it by the language that reads it... So, "the [language] medium is the message" is a way to turn the insight into common sense, without losing the mystery. <br><br>So, first off, I think "green wizzards" are people who realize that every separate language in nature creates its own meanings... and that generally how the communities of nature joined by their language will physically react to the same information will be distinctly different. <br><br>I think that's how to begin to untangle the reasons why the social networks of the environmental community all continue to believe social action that makes the economy more efficient will reduce resource depletion and conflicts when the physical system they are acting on responds to a different drummer, i.e. the opposite way. http://www.synapse9.com/drafts/StimAsConstraint.pdf<br><br><a href=seeking-gaianomicon.html#c5565580924727321828 title="comment permalink">7/9/10, 5:41 AM</a><br><br>

When it was lost to mildew in storage a few years ago, I went to replace it and discovered that she revised it in 2000. The formula for herbal shampoo that started with Woolite(tm) is gone, replaced by one based on castile soap, and the recipe section has fattened considerably (sunflower milk, anyone?) but most of the good stuff, from DIY musical instruments to “Bathing where water is scarce” to cooking with acorns to home birth, is still there. Has a drawing of a naked hippie right on the cover! (How did that get past the publisher in these prudish times?) Much good stuff in the "further reading" section, too.

By that I don't mean that gathering-hunting humans never did damage to a local ecosystem, but only that the large-scale destruction we cope with today has its origins in agriculture, in <b>the way humans have exhausted the energy-rich carbon of the soil</b>, what Jackson would call the first step in the entrenchment of an extractive economy. Human agricultural practices vary from place to place but have never been sustainable over the long term." [My emphasis added.]<br><br><br>The phrase I've put in bold seems to me to show that Jensen clearly misunderstand what soil exhaustion is, as well as where carbon is and its role in plant growth. I also believe Jensen is wrong in saying that agricultural practices everywhere have <b>never</b> been sustainable over the long term. As a child, I lived for a year in Japan, where night soil was collected in "honey buckets" and put on the fields (they used humanure, applying a word I've learned from a commenter here.)

I'll just make an initial disclaimer that I'm not a building expert, but a few things struck me about this. My first thought was that American houses are very different from here in the UK, where timber-built homes are almost unheard-of. Nearly everything is brick, concrete or stone, and cavity-wall insulation and double-glazing have already been heavily promoted for the past three decades. The problems we have a a bit different - for example how to insulate cavity-less older cottages and Victorian terraces. <br><br>I thought maybe going to the second-hand bookshop to find 70s books aimed at a British audience, and realised that even 70s Britain was a very different place. The houses built since then present very different challenges. They are nearly all without chimneys, having been designed for gas central heating (how to fit a woodburner in one of these?), are small with no storage space, if they have gardens then they're often small and have no top-soil (only a couple of inches of turf overlaying several feet of building rubble), very often house-proud owners and lazy gardeners have covered them with decking, paving, concrete or gravel, and turning all this into a productive garden is a bit of a challenge.<br><br>I think my point is that some of the techniques that work in one set of circumstances may not be relevant for another, in which case a different set of things need to be learnt. I think green wizards in different parts of the world may have to pick and choose or adjust certain parts of the "curriculum" to suit local conditions.<br><br>Also some of the problems are completely new, and solutions will have to be devised from scratch. There will probably be a lot of "muddling through", I suppose just what the original pioneers had to do in the 70s.<br><br><a href=seeking-gaianomicon.html#c5922482419594526884 title="comment permalink">7/10/10, 3:19 AM</a><br><br>

(Try this address: www.scythesupply.com.) They make European-style scythes, which I find far more wieldy than the big curved snath of most American designs. There's a range of blades to choose from for different types of work and terrain, whetstones and peening kits, and a range of instructional materials.

I got the shorter, wider brush blade rather than the longer, thinner grass blade; in the long run I can already tell I will want both. I got it from the Marugg Company in Tennessee (they have a web site for online orders and including instructional videos). You can get a basic starter kit (blade, snath, whetstone) for around $130 including shipping. Considering that a good gasoline-powered walk-behind mower will set you back around $400 or more, that price seems like a bargain to me. They make them all by hand. There are only two or three companies I know of in the U.S. who still make and sell new scythes.

My guess is that the current hoopla over synthetic biology is right up there with the assurances by fusion power researchers that fusion power is just about ready to be deployed, or those from computer scientists that they'll be able to create computers that think any day now, really, etc., etc. Technology's reach tolerably often exceeds its grasp these days. <br><br>Don, yep, it's a treasure hunt. One of those books in particular -- Reif's book on solar retrofits -- is worth its weight in paid heating bills, if it's the one I recall (I don't have a copy, more's the pity -- thinking back to a library copy). <br><br>SeaMari, yes. To begin with, all this material will be turned into a book and published, so a few thousand copies should be in circulation within a few years, and by that time there will also be a bunch of green wizards running around who can take apprentices of their own. There will also be other arrangements I plan on making as the shape of the internet's decline becomes clearer. If anything happens suddenly -- for example, an unexpected war with China involving cyberattacks that flatten the internet -- I'd like to ask everyone to drop a letter to the Cultural Conservers Foundation at PO Box 914, Cumberland MD 21501 and I'll make arrangements for a monthly print newsletter to go out with this stuff in it. <br><br>Timewalker, that's true enough. There was a large and active appropriate tech scene in Britain in the 70s as well, and if you look around you should be able to find books and other information on how to retrofit British houses for energy efficiency -- if you find anything that's not under copyright, scan it and send me a copy, and I can make it available to European readers generally (and those in the older parts of the US, where frame houses aren't as universal as they are in Seattle). <br><br>Edde, yes, this stuff is pretty much standard -- which is part of the reason I've tried to get it into circulation!<br><br>Lance, that seems quite likely! <br><br>Fern, <i>Square Foot Gardening</i> counts! That's going to be one of the books I recommend for people who haven't gardened before and want to make a start. <br><br>Lance (again), good. The course you've outlined is a good deal more anthropocentric than what I had in mind. Still, do they have anything on ecology qua ecology, focusing primarily on nonhuman natural systems? That might be useful for those who learn well from videos.<br><br><a href=seeking-gaianomicon.html#c5460108906720399018 title="comment permalink">7/10/10, 4:43 PM</a><br><br>

The teacher is a noted urban ecologist, thus he is used to dealing with people as integral to ecology, as well as encountering political/ideological objections to ecology (anti-climate change rants for example). So the course is designed with the idea that at least some viewers may be anti-ecology skeptics.<br><br>1. The course is based on the assumption of human self-interest. That many people proceed not from altruism but from self-interest, namely "What's in it for me?" Self-interest is, after all, common to all organisms who seek to maximize nutrients, sexual reproduction, etc. Instead of preaching, the approach of this course is engaging students through self-interest (ahh, is this not also a product of our times?) Odum's work is central to this course.<br><br>2. With that human self-interest in mind, the lectures are arranged in a series of pairs, with the first part on the nonhuman ecology and the second part of each pair on the human effects on the nonhuman ecology. One could watch those parts out of order. So if one is uninterested in the human effects, certainly one could just watch the nonhuman parts. <br><br>Re-arranged, the lectures (each 30-minutes long) would then be:<br><br>NONHUMAN/ECOLOGY QUA ECOLOGY<br>7. Movement of Energy through Living Systems<br>9. Nutrient Cycling in Ecosystems<br>11. The Water Cycle and Climate<br>13. Rain and Heat—Forces That Shape Climate<br>15.

Out of some 7,500 people in this village about 5,000 made their living directly from their looms. While nearly every household had books of images by Picasso or Escher there were no books on how to build a loom. It seems that the loom there is as integral as a snails shell is to the snail. Interestingly enough, each loom could be disassembled with the removal of a few key wooden dowels. Thus looms of different sizes could be brought into production depending on the current demands of the market. <br> What I found most fascinating about these people is that they survived the double whammy of Monteczuma and shortly thereafter the ravages of Cortez. It seems that the ability to produce cloth is so essential that even would be rapers and pillagers will step back a bit that they may have something to cover their loins. <br> A step further along takes one into looking at how the wool of sheep is turned into yarn. It seems like the more basic the article being produced the more deep and profound the lore that surrounds it. <br> As an aside to this I came back with my bags filled with various 'naturales', which are wools of color that come directly from sheep of color. I'm currently involved in an exchange with a skilled knitter who is creating a fine sweater that I can wear in the cold and damp winters (which is when I'm often found along the banks of our local river chasing the elusive Chinook Salmon. <br> Happy weaving.<br><br><a href=seeking-gaianomicon.html#c6448264056289963908 title="comment permalink">7/11/10, 10:12 PM</a><br><br>

There's no © symbol anywhere that I can find. The inside cover says: "This is a reprint of Part 4 from the 1977 Yearbook of Agriculture, <i>Gardening for Food and Fun</i>. The Yearbook may be purchased at government bookstores or ordered from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402." The contents of the book were originally in a section titled "Home Food Preservation." The reprint that I purchased has been retitled <i>Canning, Freezing, Storing Garden Produce</i> and is numbered "Agriculture Information Bulletin 410."<br><br>I don't have a scanner, but if you'd like a copy, I'll try to find one that I can use. If all else fails, I could perhaps photocopy it and send it by snail mail. There are 86 pages altogether. The dehydrator article doesn't include detailed instructions (the authors provided an address where those could once be obtained for 25¢), but the diagram has given me a clearer idea of what's required. Whenever it's sunny again and I have a couple of free hours, I plan to experiment with my solar oven. I want to see if I can get adequate airflow and a temp hovering around 140°F if I slightly prop the glass panel. If not, I might enjoy building a real dehydrator. Our raspberry bushes are prolific, and it'd be good to have an alternate storage method to freezing.<br><br><b>Tom Rainboro</b>, for American-made products, the directory at <a href=http://www.stillmadeinusa.com/appliances.html rel=nofollow>StillMadeInTheUSA.com</a> is the place I usually check first. I'm lusting after a CookTek induction burner but will have to save up a lot of pennies for that. Our solar oven is an Indian-made Tulsi Hybrid model: it plugs in and functions as a slow cooker when the sky is cloudy. We also use a German-made Brill reel mower for what little lawn we have left.<br><br>Incidentally, while I was shopping for books, I also ordered <a href=http://sewmachinerepair.com/treadleguide.htm rel=nofollow><i>The Complete Guide to Treadle Sewing Machines</i></a>, which was the only repair book I could find.

Sitemeter and other tracking services tend to only catch a fraction of your real traffic -- for instance they miss people who use RSS, which is an increasing and very substantial chunk of the traffic. They also often work via logging requests for an embedded image, which of course won't count anyone who has default image loading turned off. I know on my own Little Red Blog, last year when I was posting the woodpecker sagas and attracting more attention than usual, I only had about 5 people commenting on my postings. Sitemeter showed a few hundred hits on each entry. But the video clips I linked via the posts (not hosted on youtube, so they would not get much random surfing traffic) each got about 500-1000 views in the first couple of days, suggesting my total readership was far greater than indicated by sitemeter. So I'd guess the readership for The Archdruid Report is well up in the thousands, maybe over 10,000.<br><br><a href=seeking-gaianomicon.html#c4870565066241736943 title="comment permalink">7/14/10, 8:11 AM</a><br><br>

Having read numerous ecology textbooks however (I am surprised you are so quick to assume I haven't, given that you can't possibly know either way), that all seem to suggest that ecosystem threatening change is something unusual on a planet that has been changing for 4.5 billion years, I am just trying to raise concerns about the pro-stasis (conservation), anti-temporary-breakaway-success bias often contained within. Mature ecosystems are like mature capitalist economies. They are full of hyper-specialised "species" all working in a system with no reserve capacity and they are extremely delicate as a result. Periodic ecosystem collapses (and indeed population collapses) are perfectly natural and I think the full implications of the struggle for life are better served by The Origin of Species. If you don't think people should read The Origin of Species while educating themselves about the reality of life on Earth, fair enough, but I think they should, paying careful attention to the central role of fierce competition between members of the same species. Humans are tribal and though the energy bounty of fossil fuels has recently led some to conclude that we can all live happily ever after, when that energy source starts to decline intraspecies competition will increase. I don't know what this will lead to, but, given the ubiquitous role of interspecies competition in the rest of nature, I think it would be extremely wise to consider future scenarios that involve it. <br><br>Kind regards,<br><br>Matthew<br><br><a href=seeking-gaianomicon.html#c1957301533231454092 title="comment permalink">7/15/10, 12:26 AM</a><br><br>

It has since been taken down, due to copyright issues, but when I was able to watch it, I was saddened by the ground that has been lost since then.
