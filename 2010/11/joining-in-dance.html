Recent headlines, it seems to me, put an interesting slant on the much-ballyhooed claim that we live in an information society. I’m thinking here especially of the slow-motion train wreck of the US banking system now under way, courtesy of the very same system of slicing and packaging real estate debt that was praised to the skies as a brilliant financial innovation a few short years ago.<br><br>Now of course, as John Kenneth Galbraith pointed out long before the phrase “mortgage-backed securities” found its way onto any up-to-date list of popular oxymorons, innovation in the world of finance almost always refers to the rediscovery of one of a handful of very bad ideas that resulted in economic disaster every other time they’ve been used, and can be counted on to do the same thing this time, too. Still, there’s another dimension to the current mess, which is that a large fraction of the trouble that’s sent stock prices of a dozen large banks into a crash dive is the result of simple sloppiness in information handling.<br><br>The laws governing mortgages in the US sensibly require a paper trail showing all transfers of the right to collect from the mortgage, and they also require the people who process foreclosure paperwork to at least glance through the stacks of papers they’re signing. In millions of cases in America alone, these very simple steps weren’t done, the relevant information wasn’t kept or wasn’t read, and an economy that’s still staggering from the body blow it received from the implosion of the housing bubble has just taken another hit.<br><br>You might think that an information society would do better than that, but this is par for the course these days. In the modern industrial world, most of the time, the only phases of information’s life cycle that get more than cursory attention are its production and distribution, and then only in terms of raw quantities – the sort of measure that doesn’t differentiate between cures for cancer and Lady Gaga’s latest round of failed attempts to make herself look interesting. Those who insist that producing ever larger volumes of information will somehow lead us to Utopia tend to pass over the fate of all that information once it comes sluicing out the business end of our society’s information factories, and they tend to pay even less attention, if that’s possible, to the origins and destiny of the information that isn’t produced in digital form by the busy labor of human beings.<br><br>It’s this other kind of information that I’d like to place at the center of this week’s discussion, because it’s central to many aspects of the Green Wizards project. The natural world contains and circulates a vast amount of information. We can read a very small fraction of it, but that doesn’t mean we can do without it; most of what keeps human beings alive on this planet just now is a function of the information economy of nature.<br><br>There are any number of examples, but the one that comes to mind just at the moment is the wealth of information to be found in the seeds of any open-pollinated plant. Seeds can be understood in several different ways, but one of the most useful is to think of them as a medium for information storage. Like other media, they will reproduce the information they contain under some specific set of conditions; just as a DVD stores information in one form but will present it in another – for example, a movie – when you put it in a DVD player and press the start button, a seed stores information in the form of DNA, and will present it in another – a plant – when you put it in appropriate soil and add sun and water. What sets seeds apart from DVDs as a far more sophisticated information technology, of course, is that when you play a movie, the movie doesn’t manufacture new DVDs for all your friends, much less shuffle the movie just a bit in every generation, in a way that tends to produce a better plot and snappier jokes as time goes on.<br><br>Seeds, by contrast, do an exact equivalent of this. This is why when you tap a seed envelope against your hand and send a single seed rolling out onto your palm, you’re holding two billion years of stored information. That’s how long, according to current paleontology, the process of evolution has been shaping the genetic code of living things related to the ones we encounter today, and every generation across that unimaginable length of time has contributed something to the shaping of the little packet of genetic material, nutrition, and protective layers we call a plant seed.<br><br>It would be helpful if more people kept this in mind. It would also be helpful if people noticed that the different varieties of any cultivated plant very often contain hundreds or thousands of years of human-derived information on top of the two billion year collection handed over by nature. Instead, we’ve got a world in which this extraordinary wealth of information is treated even more cavalierly than big US banks treat mortgage paperwork, and in particular, where most commercial seed companies sell a handful of bland varieties aimed at the lowest common denominator, producing them each year by hybridizing processes that normally keep them from breeding true from seed in the next generation. It’s very much as though all the more interesting books in most of the nation’s libraries were to be replaced by stacks of identical copies of some gaudy journalistic volume about Lady Gaga’s cleavage.<br><br>This would be bad enough if those of us who farm or garden could count on an uninterrupted supply of Gagaesque hybrid seeds for the foreseeable future. For a range of reasons, starting with the end of the age of cheap energy, we can’t. The seed industry is one of the world’s most monopolistic; the vast majority of all seeds produced and sold in the industrial world come from a tiny handful of vast conglomerates, and their production, transport and marketing requires huge amounts of fossil fuels. It’s sobering to realize that the bankruptcy of one of the big seed corporations just before the Northern Hemisphere’s planting season could leave millions of farmers with no access to seed stock. It’s even more sobering to consider the far more likely impact of assorted financial and energy bottlenecks on seed availability as an economy in prolonged crisis intersects with spikes in energy, transport, and agricultural chemical costs as we stumble down the far side of Hubbert’s peak.<br><br>Fortunately there are other options, and I would encourage green wizards in training to explore them. The place to start, unless you happen to have a thriving garden and plenty of heirloom seed stock in place already, is one or more of the seed exchanges and small seed companies that make it their work to keep old, non-hybrid varieties of cultivated plants available. You’ll want to look for a source of this kind that carries old varieties from the area where you’re living and growing your garden, because – surprise – the varieties that do best in an organic garden in any given area are very often the varieties that did best in that area before chemical agriculture was invented. Finding a relatively local seed source is also helpful if transport becomes problematic, since your chances of being able to access seeds is a good deal better when the source is two counties away than when it’s on the far side of a continent.<br><br>The ultimate in short supply chains, of course, is to save seeds from the plants you grow. This is definitely a goal for any organic gardener to have in mind, but in my experience, at least, it’s not something to take up immediately unless you have no other choice or already have quite a bit of skill in gardening. Every species of plant has its own life cycle, every variety of plant rings its own changes on that life cycle, and the seed – the vehicle by which the plant sends its information on to the future – is often exquisitely sensitive to subtle cues you may not notice if you’re not watching. To save seed with any kind of reliable success, you need to know the life cycle, habits, and needs of the plant with which you’re working, so that you can give the seed the conditions it needs.<br><br>Some of those conditions can be very unexpected to the novice. The seeds of quite a few plants, for example, need to go through a period of fairly intense cold before they will sprout. Keep the seeds of ome of these plants in a heated basement and plant them out in spring, and you’ll get no results that year, because the seeds are waiting for the signal that tells them that winter has come and gone and it’s safe to start growing. You can give them the signal they need by storing them in an unheated space or, in the case of seeds that need a good strong chill, sticking them in the refrigerator for a couple of months. Others have a waterproof coating on the surface, and may need to be scuffed on a sheet of fine grit sandpaper. Still others have unique requirements of their own.<br><br>There are also plants that can’t be grown from seed at all, or that are best propagated in other ways. Potatoes, for example, don’t breed true from seeds – if you let yours go to seed and they set seed that’s viable, which is by no means certain, you’re as likely as not to get a half-wild Andean tuber that may or may not be edible at all. For a good many centuries, instead, potatoes have been propagated by chopping a potato into pieces, each one with its own eye, and burying the chunks in the soil. You need to know that if you want to grow potatoes – and you need to know similar lessons if you want to grow a fair number of other plants.<br><br>What this means is that you can’t save seeds or propagate plants in other ways without learning a fair amount about the plants you grow, and participating in their ecology and their life cycle. Seeds are not machines; you can’t make them do what you want them to do, unless it’s what they’ve spent the last few million years evolving to do. You have to meet them more than halfway. You can’t stand back and wrap yourself in the fraying rags of the failed myth that still convinces too many people that humanity is some kind of alien force, separate from Nature and reduced to poking her with a stick in place of any deeper communion; you have to take your seeds by the hand and join them in the dance.<br><br>Now of course this is what I’d hope to see any prospective green wizard doing, in one way or another. All our work in this project can be seen from one perspective as learning how to make sense of the information provided us by nature, rather than restricting our diet of information to the often far less nourishing fare served up in horse doctor’s doses by the various mass production and dissemination schemes of human society. Using solar energy on a small scale, for example, can’t be done successfully unless you shake off the assumptions that three hundred years of ever more abundant fossil fuel supplies have taught those of us who live in the world’s industrial nations, and learn how to think about energy from sunlight; that’s what will show you what you can do with the sun’s diffuse heat, and how to orient yourself in space and time to make the best use of it. Choose some other piece of appropriate technology or green living and you’ll find yourself in the same place, learning what you need to know from a teacher who doesn’t happen to be human and doesn’t speak the language you do, but is more than willing to lead you in the dance we call Nature.<br><br>Next week we’ll be talking about another way to participate in that dance. For now, I’d like to encourage students of green wizardry to put some time into locating sources of heirloom and non-hybrid seeds in their own regions, and get themselves on mailing lists for a few local seed catalogs; if you have any way of putting in a garden this coming spring, you should plan on doing so, and in that case you’ll want the catalogs this winter. If the seed sources you find are nonprofits, send a few dollars their way as a donation to help cover the cost of the catalog – many of them operate on shoestring budgets, and the collapsing economy has left the shoestring even more frayed than usual. A book or two on saving seeds might also be a good purchase at this time, if your organic gardening library doesn’t already contain ample information on that subject.<br><br><span style=font-size:130%>Resources</span><br><br>The two books I’ve always used as information sources for saving seeds and propagating plants are Marc Rogers’ <i>Saving Seeds</i> -- an expanded version of the Seventies classic <i>Growing and Saving Vegetable Seeds</i> -- and Lewis Hill’s <i>Secrets of Plant Propagation</i>. Both books give a fair amount of space to garden ornamentals, and Hill likes to use chemical pesticides, which has always seemed unnecessary to me; still, both books contain a wealth of practical information. Many general books on organic gardening also include a chapter on saving your own seeds, or include this and other propagation instructions in the sections that cover specific food plants.

And getting a variety registered costs both money and time.<br>Now there has come a second EU directive <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:312:0044:0054:EN:PDF" rel=nofollow>2009/145/EC</a>, which actually allows more types of heirloom seeds to be sold after a simpler registration procedure. But still registration is needed. And a fee is to be paid for each registered variety. And bureaucratic requirements must be met.<br>Over the last few days there has been an outrage in Sweden over this with our department of agriculture at the center of the anger.<br>So make sure the legislation in your country is not changed to make it more difficult to get heirloom seeds.

This is good to hear. <br><br>Onion, and that wonder is perhaps the best of all starting places for the real work ahead of us, which is (re)learning to participate in Nature rather than simply ignoring or bullying her.<br><br>John, no argument there. My point is simply that you need to know what you're doing. <br><br>Janne, thank you! If you haven't already, please be sure to post this on <a href=http://www.greenwizards.org rel=nofollow>the Green Wizards forum</a> as well. <br><br>Between, thank you for the book recommendation. <br><br>Youth, likewise. As for large scale soil restoration, remember that the focus of this project is on things that individuals can do in their own time and with resources readily available to them. If you've got some references for ways to manage large scale soil restoration on that basis, I'd welcome hearing about them. <br><br>Robin, good. That's exactly the advantage the perspective of deep time brings with it. <br><br>John, I should probably have drawn the metaphor in more detail. The viewers who prefer one version of the DVD because it has a better plot, and so play it more often and give it more chances to reproduce itself, provide the (un)natural selection that moves in the direction of greater fitness over time. By the way, if I may note a pet peeve of mine: that's "fascist," not "facist." "Facist" sounds like somebody who goes around making faces at people he doesn't like. <br><br>Flute, true enough. Thanks for a useful reminder. <br><br>Between, er, I never said that evolution was teleological, just that it works to improve fitness over time.

I was just watching a video on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVeS1yIA7x0" rel=nofollow>hazards of GMO seeds</a>. While learning about the multitude of scientific studies proving the hazards is interesting, one shouldn't need to spend that much time to come to that conclusion. With a decent understanding of evolution one should realize instantly, with a high degree of certainty, that GMO seeds are dangerous to humans and the environment. As JMG stated seeds have evolved over billions of years to fit an environment with millions of variables, and humans have evolved to digest foods with specific attributes. Changing the genetic code of seeds, and then releasing mass amounts of it into the wild without the most extreme testing is insane. <br><br><br><br>@ZenMouser from last week<br><i>Emptying their minds,<br>Filling their bellies,<br>Weakening their ambitions,<br>And strengthening their bones</i>....<br><br>The mass media bombards people with scary stories all day.

I'm still new to it, and don't trust my techniques enough to share (ie: my lettuce seeds are labelled "Lettuce", though they could be one of four varieties - it got crazy at harvest-time) but I am able to save and re-grow several veggies, herbs and medicinal flowers. The conditions of storage are very important! I was so disappointed the first year when I saw that some of my seeds had mold due to damp conditions, and some had been invaded by bugs due to open storage conditions! So this year, I got airtight plastic containers and a good supply of dessicant, and hopefully have selected an area of my unheated studio that is neither too warm nor too cold.<br><br>However, I will also say that stripping off seed and getting it ready to store can be overwhelming (esp. for a compulsive person like me who wants to save all of it!), and I still have a few paper bags sitting around, and I'll label those seeds "iffy" for next year.

The same issue relates to fruit trees (as well as other trees and shrubs) as you really need a large genetic pool with which to draw upon.<br><br>I'm lucky enough to be able to shop at the Queen Victoria Market in Melbourne for fruit and vegetables. Not only is it well priced and competitive, it also stocks a diversity of produce from diverse suppliers (it's big).<br><br>Even so, over the year you'll only ever find about maybe 8 different types of apples. There were once over 7,000 varieties (I have about 26 planted – lots of cider apples!) across the world most of which are now lost. With their loss comes the loss of genetic diversity and resilience in the species as well.<br><br>A small genetic pool means that overall the species is subject to shocks that happen in nature regardless of farm management techniques.<br><br>Here, I find some years are better for yellow stone fruit, others white stone fruit. Cherries are subject to short heat waves and may split in heavy rainfalls. Some apricots types do better in dry seasons than wet seasons. I could go on but you never know what you'll get until you pick it.<br><br>The industrialisation of our food production systems is a real weakness. I diverse food forest provides insurance that a mono crop can never give and as hard as people would like to try you cannot produce consistently on a long term basis.<br><br>Getting back to it though, I recommend that if you have the space, try some seedling fruit trees. It's a bit of a gamble, but most seedling fruit trees seem to be hardier and more resistant to the shocks that nature continually throws at them. Also you begin to select for trees that do well in your area.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><a href=#c17688742109399271 title="comment permalink">11/14/10, 2:10 AM</a><br><br>

I forgot to mention that most fruit trees that are in production now are grafted varieties and not seedlings.<br><br>The difference is that a grafted tree (eg. apple) will have roots that come from one seedling specie and at an early age, they'll cut off the top of the tree and graft on another known compatible specie of fruit tree.<br><br>The thing is with grafting, you get a genetically identical fruit tree growing so you can guarantee the type of fruit that develops on the tree. This is great for orchardists who produce according to demand and/or fads.<br><br>The roots (or rootstock) determines how big and/or disease resistant the final tree is. The rootstock if left to grow may also produce an interesting tree in itself, but usually these are cut back if they develop as they outcompete the grafted part of the tree.<br><br>Seedling trees on the other hand may produce an identical or random variation from that of the tree that produced it.<br><br>Take for example the Granny Smith apple. This was found as a seedling apple tree which by chance grew in a garden (Mrs. Smith's) in New South Wales - Australia. Now it’s very widely spread from just one seedling tree.<br><br>If we fail to grow seedling trees and only produce a small variety of fruit then we reduce the genetic diversity of the plants - and you never know what you may end up with - it may even be an improvement on the original fruit.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><a href=#c7346847995232263142 title="comment permalink">11/14/10, 3:42 AM</a><br><br>

One of the anthropologists at my university runs a seed bank and holds periodic swaps: Arkansans should have a look at <a href=http://arkansasagro.wordpress.com/ rel=nofollow>CAAH</a>, while others might want to look for similar initiatives in their own states.<br><br>My personal experience with saving seed is that the hardest part isn't so much saving the seed per se -- at least not for the veggies I usually grow -- but avoiding crossbreeding. Cultivated carrots, for instance, freely cross with wild carrots a.k.a. "Queen Anne's lace", which is very common here; I'd have a heck of a time maintaining pure carrot strains. And most summer and winter squash, zucchini, pumpkins, etc. are varieties of the same species (<i>Cucurbita pepo</i>), and will freely hybridize with each other. Plant yellow squash and zucchini next to each other, and the Gods only know what you'll get from any seeds you save. There are ways around that, but they can be labor-intensive.<br><br>Growing diverse varieties can also create a problem: if you like growing fifteen different tomato varieties at once, or ten different cucumbers, that'll make it harder to save seed (unless you're willing to grow possible hybrid seed and see what happens -- which might be a useful experiment, but not if you're counting on getting a certain return).<br><br>On the other hand, beans usually self-fertilize and will breed true from seed. Garlic and shallots normally reproduce asexually; cross-fertilization isn't an issue at all. These are ridiculously easy to save and propagate. My best recommendation would be to start with the easy plants, and work up to the trickier ones -- as CM said, maybe learn how to save one or a few new seeds every year. That's what I'm working towards.<br><br><a href=#c9142377262009892930 title="comment permalink">11/14/10, 1:28 PM</a><br><br>

I talk to the older Amish around here and they worry that their own old ways are fading within their own community. They do not necessarily farm organically either. They are more and more growing a cash economy based on tourism and farmers markets. In my community, Amish are seen more and more regularly shopping in the Mall*Wart, to which they travel in regular gasoline vans. Don't read me as too harsh, they still know much about this stuff especially in the older generations. But in recent years I have seen Amish boys using gasoline weed-eaters and rototillers, been in Amish houses that were powered by propane, and seen a field that used to be plowed by horses every spring now being plowed by a diesel tractor. <br><br>The Amish are not motivated by environmentalism or sustainability. They are motivated by religious fundamentalism, family and community cohesion, and the desire to strictly observe their sabbath and scriptures as they understand them. Technology is evaluated on a case-by-case basis under these principles, not under ideas of sustainability. <br><br>So, the Amish are a good resource. But don't romanticize them or idolize them or make them out to be a primo model for sustainable living.<br><br><a href=#c1813280187925438993 title="comment permalink">11/15/10, 8:01 PM</a><br><br>

Grafting is pretty easy although for my place I purchase grafted fruit trees and grow seedling fruit trees. I went to a heritage apple farm a couple of years ago and picked up heaps of grafted apple trees all of which have taken. The main problem is that I don't have access to the root stock trees and don't wish to let them take over one of the purchased grafted trees.<br><br>You can check out the Wikipedia entry here:<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafting<br><br>There are probably also heaps of video's on youtube to show you how to graft.<br><br>It sounds as though you have quite an old apple tree next door. I'd recommend putting some of the seeds in potting mix and leaving it over winter and see what turns up over the following summer. It sounds a bit hit or miss, but you may be surprised to find that the tree that grows isn't that dissimilar from the one next door. If you keep it in a large pot and feed it with worm tea's, compost etc. when a seedling begins you'll find it won't grow all that large anyway because the root system can't get too big in the pot. Most advice that you see for fruit trees seems aimed at the commercial grower. If I get a yield of fruit that's only 80% of the original tree it doesn't bother me.<br><br>Most seedling trees don't seem to differ too much from the parent tree, which is a shame. They also seem hardier as their root systems are larger and better able to forage for water and nutrients over dry periods.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><a href=#c8660074875975057552 title="comment permalink">11/17/10, 1:42 AM</a><br><br>

Finance is indeed built around an information model, that assures a dollar saved in the past will forever earn multiplying material returns in the future. The physical world simply doesn't work that way... and very fascinating that our information theory people have not noticed... but still, isn't it also "high time" we recognized that our centuries of strenuous effort to run a physical world on a perpetual escalator have not made it work. <br><br>From a physical world view profit comes from the organization of the whole producing more than is needed for the parts. That's also called "net energy" and all systems have to have it to work at all, and to get started any system needs to have multiply profits of that kind, for a while. <br><br>Investors, though, take the profits to call their own, to accumulate more and more, rather than to recycle as rewards for parts of the system generating their rewards they find agreeable. Instead they withhold making investments unless they feel assured they'll get multiplying returns for themselves, believing that can be endless like it was a Ponzi scheme! <br><br>How about calling the alternative "recycling the magic" or "returning the rewards" instead of what I've been calling it... whatever that was. <br><br>Have more good blog posts recently too. www.synapse9.com/blog<br><br><a href=#c2926460255464084457 title="comment permalink">11/17/10, 6:07 AM</a><br><br>
