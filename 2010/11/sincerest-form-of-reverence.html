I’ve commented more than once in these essays about the mismatch between history as it happens and history as it’s finally written down after the fact. Events that seem to pile up on top of one another in the history books are usually experienced, by the people who were there at the time, as widely spaced threads in a fabric woven mostly of the ordinary occurrences of daily life. Even when drastic changes break over a civilization, the people who are affected normally have to spend so much time scrambling to make ends meet that the scale of the transformation becomes evident only in retrospect.<br><br>I’ve come to think we’re in the middle of such a process right now. Recent headlines note events that most people would have considered cataclysmic not that long ago. The price of oil is bouncing along above $80 a barrel, the International Energy Agency has now admitted that peak oil happened in 2006, the United States is openly covering its debts by means of the printing press, and agricultural commodity prices have jolted upwards to unprecedented levels under the paired pressures of an increasingly unstable climate and a disintegrating global economic system, just for starters.<br><br>If I’d presented a scenario for 2010 ten years ago that included these details, most people who read it would have dismissed me as a wild-eyed prophet of doom. Yet here we are, and most of us in America, at least, are paying more attention to the upcoming holidays than we are to the accelerating dissolution of the only world most of us have known, and the rapid approach of a future that a great many of us will find very unwelcome indeed.<br><br>Still, this is normal. The human mind does not readily grasp the perspectives of deep time; it takes a fair amount of study and practice to get to that inner state where the mind slips free from the tyranny of daily life and grasps time on the grand scale. That inner state has been an option for a very long time; Mayan <i>itz’atob</i>, to name only one example from the past, were perfectly able to apply their knowledge of observational astronomy to time here on earth, and imagine a past that reached back over quite impressive periods and a future that stretches for millennia beyond the 2012 <i>bak’tun</i>-rollover that’s attracting so much undeserved attention these days. I doubt that such perspectives were easy to achieve then; they certainly aren’t easy for most people now; but they’re crucial for this week’s post, which focuses on one way that green wizards can take part in the process of evolution.<br><br>I use that word with a great deal of trepidation. There may be other concepts that have been as heavily frosted with myth, misunderstanding, ideological static and sheer unadulterated drivel, but just at the moment I can’t think of one. Our culture’s obsession with a Utopian future has turned Darwin’s simple and elegant insight into a shuttlecock batted back and forth by a flurry of ineptly handled intellectual rackets; believers in progress equate it with their notion of a future of infinite improvement, believers in apocalypse treat it as a flat denial of their faith in a future where everyone who disagrees with them will be roadkill on history’s highway, and a great many people who don’t manage to fall into either camp seem to have lost track of the fact that it means much of anything at all.<br><br>My favorite example is still the woman who put up her hand at the end of a talk of mine in a small and very liberal Left Coast town and said, “But don’t you think that children are so much more evolved than adults?” It took a few baffled questions on my part to figure out that by “evolved” she meant “nice,” from which I gathered she hadn’t spent much time around children lately. When I suggested that she might consider reading Darwin’s <i>The Origin of Species</i> before using the word “evolution” again, she looked horrified and asked, “Do I have to?”<br><br>Evidently so. In fact, I don’t think it’s going too far to ask my readers – especially those engaged in the Green Wizards project – to follow the same advice. Darwin was a more than capable writer; his <i>The Voyage of the Beagle</i> counts as one of the classics of travel literature; his scientific works are written in a more discursive and formal style than their modern equivalents, and this can take a bit of getting used to, at least for people – the majority these days, one gathers – who don’t usually read books older than they are. Still, <i>The Origin of Species</i> is not an intolerably long book. It can be read in a few evenings, and it’s worth investing that much time to watch the foundation of today’s life sciences being built by one of the modern world’s great minds.<br><br>Now it’s true, of course, that some of the details of Darwin’s theory have had to be changed since his time, as more evidence has come in. This doesn’t make <i>The Origin of Species</i> any less worth reading. There’s much to be learned, in fact, by treating the theory of evolution as an example of the process it describes: the intellectual mutation set in motion by Darwin’s work spawned a flurry of variations, which were then sorted out by the selective pressures of further research. As Thomas Kuhn pointed out in <i>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i>, the same process can be traced all through intellectual history – one piece of evidence among many that evolution, in something like the sense Darwin gave the word, is a basic property of all complex systems.<br><br>One of those complex systems is the one we’ve been discussing in the last dozen or so posts, the backyard organic food garden. One of the first and most crucial things to keep in mind about that system is that it’s an ecosystem like any other; like many ecosystems, it’s primarily shaped by the actions of a single species, which in this case happens to be yours. This last point is sometimes exaggerated into the claim that a garden is somehow separate from Nature or wholly subject to human will, which is nonsense; that might be the case if you were growing your plants in a sterile growth medium sealed off from the rest of the world – a bad idea under almost any conditions, and particularly so in an age of diminishing energy and resource availability.<br><br>A more useful way to think of a garden, rather, is to compare it to those East African forests that are primarily shaped by the presence and activities of elephants, say, or the tallgrass prairies in North America that took their basic ecological beat from the pounding hooves of the buffalo. No boundary separates such ecosystems from the rest of Nature; countless other organisms evolve ways to take advantage of the opportunities opened up by the dominant species, which coevolves in turn to benefit from, or at least not get clobbered by, the other species in the ecosystem. It’s not the only way to run an ecosystem – there are plenty of ecosystems that have no single dominant species – but it’s tolerably common, and very often highly successful.<br><br>That’s what a garden is, when it’s worked in harmony with local environments and natural cycles; there’s nothing uniquely human about it at all. The one wild card is that human beings have pushed the trick of transmitting behavior by learning rather than instinct about as far as it can go, and a lot of our behaviors – in and out of gardens – thus can change far faster than the glacial pace of natural selection would permit. That’s our great strength as a species, and it’s also our greatest weakness; what it means in practice is that, on the downside, we can never be sure how well our learned behaviors are suited to the demands of our environment, and on the upside, if we pay attention to nature we can pick up useful behaviors in a tiny fraction of the time it would take for those same behaviors to get established as instinct by natural selection.<br><br>That’s also what a garden is or, rather, what gardening is. Human beings have been a dominant species in most environments since we spread out of Africa most of a million years ago; despite fashionable claims to the contrary, successful hunter-gatherer societies manage their environments, using fire and many other methods to encourage natural food production and discourage competition by other living things. What marked the shift from hunter-gatherer to tribal horticultural economies was not a change from blissful dependence on Nature’s bounty to brutal manipulation of the Earth, but rather a shift from one mode of ecological management to another, more sophisticated one. The key to the latter wasn’t planting things where they don’t grow naturally – archeological evidence shows that this was already being done in the Paleolithic – but taking a conscious role in the process of coevolution mentioned above. Instead of taking seeds from wild plants and scattering them in new places, as many hunter-gatherer cultures do, they began selecting seeds that had desirable properties and breeding new varieties of plants for their own uses.<br><br>Does that sound daunting? If you save the seeds of your own vegetables and replant them in your garden, you’re already doing it. Those seeds that don’t thrive well enough in your garden’s conditions to produce plants healthy enough to set seed themselves are being removed from the gene pool in the usual way; if you’ve got the sense the gods gave geese, you’re saving seeds from the healthiest and most productive plants, too, which means you’ve become an agent of natural selection, tilting the playing field in true Darwinian fashion in favor of the most viable variations.<br><br>It really is as simple as that. As I mentioned in last week’s post, saving seeds can be a good deal more complicated than it looks at first glance. Breeding new varieties of plants, by contrast, is a good deal less complicated than it looks; once you’ve worked out the details of saving seeds, all you need to do is pay attention, and you’re on your way. You aren’t going to create a new species, since you don’t have a million years or so to work on it, but you can certainly contribute to the genetic diversity and regional appropriateness of the species you’ve got.<br><br>This can be done equally well with perennial plants, and it can also be done with animals. Each of these have wrinkles of their own. Breeding perennials is generally a slow process, though this depends on the plant in question – when you plant an asparagus crown, for example, you normally have to wait for the third season thereafter to harvest asparagus spears and find out how they taste, so breeding a better asparagus is not a project to attempt in a hurry. Animals – at least the small and edible kind that make sense in a backyard garden – breed annually, and so developing your own breed is very much an option; you’ll need to learn something about genetics, but since most of your rabbits are going onto the menu before they breed anyway, you’ve got plenty of opportunities to select the traits you want to develop and exclude (and serve up for dinner) the ones you don’t.<br><br>If you decide to pursue this end of green wizardry at anything beyond the simplest level, <i>The Origin of Species</i> will become one of your better resources. Here as elsewhere in the Green Wizards project, the key to success is to figure out the way Nature does things, and copy her shamelessly. Just as, among human beings, imitation is said to be the sincerest form of flattery, I’ve come to think that when dealing with Nature, imitation may just be the sincerest form of reverence; put another way, it’s by learning Nature’s ways and adopting them as a basis for our own that we become better able to benefit ourselves and the biosphere at once.<br><br><span style=font-size:130%>Resources</span><br><br>The only worthwhile book I know on breeding your own vegetable varieties is Carol Deppe’s classic book, which sensibly enough is titled <i>Breed Your Own Vegetable Varieties</i>. Information on developing varieties of trees, vines, and other perennials can also be found in the more comprehensive books on individual crops, and those who are interested in breeding animals will find the information they need in books covering individual species. Charles Darwin’s <i>The Origin of Species</i> begins with a thoughtful chapter on the variations of domesticated species, and while it’s not a practical manual for the breeder, the principles Darwin sketches out in this book ought to be kept in mind by any green wizard.

I too have observed how the word "evolution" has been used interchangeably with other words, such as "progress," that at least to me, have completely different meanings.<br><br>I am partway through your book The Long Descent (the chapter I've found most insightful and thought-provoking was The Stories We Tell Ourselves). But I've decided that the next book I'm going to read will be the techno-optimist's "The Singularity Is Near" (I'm sure you've heard off him). Why? Well, I'm afraid that find I almost solely read books that already coincide more-or-less with my worldview, and I think it might actually be stimulating for my thought process to read something a bit different. I too am very interested in cultural narratives and how they shape visions of the future, so in that sense, reading Ray Kurzweil's book is away for me to explore that. Also, I recently learned that a good friend of mine (whose visions of the future are very robot-filled) had read it and was comfortable with a lot of its conclusions, so it will give me a chance to have an interesting debate with him. (Actually the image of both you and Kurzweil in the same room attempting to have a debate was an amusing one that also came to mind : )<br><br>I agree how most people are not fully aware of major changes happening around them as they go through daily life. I, however, sometimes feel I have the opposite problem. My daily thoughts tend to be of a "big picture" nature...Wherever I am, I'm imagining the scene as it might be viewed from someone living 100 years into the future. This is not bad, but sometimes I have trouble focusing on the importance of the "little" picture too. Like growing a garden or learning a very particular skill. I guess it's a useful art to be able to focus on both the "little" and the "big" simultaneously...<br><br><a href=#c4994608810970293407 title="comment permalink">11/17/10, 7:26 PM</a><br><br>

Children make poor company and I see few parents living their own lives. The parents seem to prefer a competitive and yet isolated existence. Very sad...<br><br>It's interesting that you write about complexity because I was having a discussion about it the other day and it was eventually agreed upon that complexity leads to apathy. <br><br>I'm interested in your point of view because I've noticed recently that in our society we seem to be increasingly subject to complex regulations. This happens for all sorts of reasons such as professional or trade capture (which is a profit driven motive) and regulatory capture (such as building controls) etc. <br><br>As the level of complexity increases though, peoples ability to cope across a wide range of issues becomes lower and thus they slip into apathy. Well, that's what I'm seeing at the moment. I'm also thinking that the incidence of this follows an inverted bell shape curve and we may be somewhere near the peak of that at the moment. Regulations are there for a reason, but it is the enforcement of those regulations that determine their level of effectiveness. I've also noticed that dysfunctional rules directly lead to dysfunctional behaviours.<br><br>It seems that this is a problem of wealthy societies (in my mind anyway), much like many of the other issues that we face at the moment. As I've stated before though, nature will sort out most of these concerns in time as the economic underpinnings of society begin to be undermined.<br><br>Another aspect of my above concerns is that it results in a mindset of fear. People become fearful with making bad decisions and end up making no decision.<br><br>This does relate to this weeks topic too! I say this because I still get people (who have never had their hands in the soil, let alone planted anything) be all to happy to give me advice about orchards and yet do nothing themselves. I'm usually very polite and listen even when the evidence is to the contrary.<br><br>A garden is like a huge experiment with nature. The best outcome is to take information from all areas and just keep experimenting and observing to see what works for your area. There is no substitute for experience and observation.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><a href=#c8850911953213650143 title="comment permalink">11/17/10, 10:31 PM</a><br><br>

Most of your writing seems to be in favor of a return to older, less technologically complex modes of life, yet I know that you as a practicing magician must respect the wizardry that has made the modern world possible. <br><br>Have you tried visualizing a future that incorporates both advanced technology and “magical thinking”? This is where I see things going – to a worldview that is neither strictly materialistic nor a return to pre-Enlightenment conditions. I suspect that the rather linear-minded, materialistic types who project doom at places like the Oil Drum are going to be rather surprised when their Malthusian predictions fail yet again. And I suspect that it will be wizards of science and invention, in the tradition of Newton, Tesla and Jack Parsons, who once again change the rules of the game and render such predictions absurd, as they have throughout history. <br><br>I can’t prove any of this, it’s just an intuition or a vision I have. I see no contradiction between Green Wizardry and Kurzweilian Singularitarians myself – both are valid and compatible ways of imagining the future. My problem is with people who get stuck in a very uncreative “doomer” narrative and insist that it’s the only possible future. I can imagine much more interesting futures myself, and as all magicians know, the key to making changes in the material world is to first imagine them in your mind.<br><br><a href=#c7018396747967343822 title="comment permalink">11/17/10, 11:04 PM</a><br><br>

I wrote in the margin that Darwin knew nothing about DNA or its role in heredity, since that wasn't discovered until much later. And Georg Mendel was still doing his research with pea plants when <i>Origin of Species</i> was published, so Darwin didn't know about genetics, either.<br><br>The students are supposed to <i>read</i> excerpts of the writings of these nature writers.

We will refer to an organism or a trait as being more "derived," meaning that it is more different than some ancestral form. A parasite that consists of nothing but a sack, a gut, and some gonads, having lost all appendages, sensory organs, breathing apparatus, etc., is very highly derived. Would you consider it "more advanced?"<br><br>Our own form is not that highly derived in many ways. We are called "primates" because our feet (hands) and teeth are not very different from the basic proto-mammalian body form. Look at your hand -- the "primitive" five digits, all similar in size and shape, all the usual bones, just one digit that is kind of stumpy and able to move in a funny way. It is much less derived than a horse's hoof or a bat's wing. So are we less evolved and less advanced than bats and horses? This is why these terms are useless; actually worse than useless, they are misleading and impede understanding. <br><br>BIOLOGICAL EVOLUTION HAS NO GOAL, AND NO HIERARCHY.<br><br><a href=#c4774420898112137965 title="comment permalink">11/18/10, 6:32 AM</a><br><br>

That's still modern human interpretation of nature based on our limited understanding of it as a world put here for us to use as WE see fit. <br><br>Which is where our awareness remains as long as we view nature to be merely the bio-mechanical substrate upon which we construct our little heavens and hells.<br><br>Even the best-intentioned apple tree planter says "my tree, my yard, my plan; you grow HERE now" and no matter how many thousands I've paid for my permaculture certificate, I'm still a human manipulating the elements of my life support.

Still, shifting focus from the realm of excess regulations to some simpler and less controlled field of action is a good way to start regaining some sense of meaning. <br><br>Sean, that's an enormously complex question, not least because "science and technology" isn't one thing, or even two, but a flurry of different things lumped together for reasons that are not always straightforward or honest. The very short form, though, is that I see "science and technology" as a good servant, a bad master, and an even worse religion. To my mind, Kurzweil is treating it as a religion, and loading it with the same hopes of salvation evangelical Christians place on the Second Coming -- he's even got the Rapture in his mythos, in the form of uploading selves into robot bodies to enjoy eternal bliss in heaven -- er, outer space. <br><br>I've discussed the prospects for a society that uses relatively high technology on a sustainable basis in my book <a href=http://www.newsociety.com/bookid/4051 rel=nofollow>The Ecotechnic Future</a>, which might be worth a glance. Still, there's a very large gap between Kurzweil's views and mine, and it's measured in the recognition -- which is central to traditional magical philosophy, by the way -- that limits exist, and that "that can't be done" is also a valid form of knowledge. <br><br>Tel, thanks for the recommendation. <br><br>Kieran, I have mixed feelings about the Long Now Foundation, but you're right -- at least they're making a very serious effort to think in the timeframes that matter. <br><br>Jason, Jensen is neither adolescent nor a fool. I see him as one of the most skilled propagandists of our time, remarkably adept at pushing the emotional buttons of today's self-proclaimed progressives and convincing a surprisingly large number of them to sign onto an agenda that most of them would reject with horror -- and deservedly so -- if they grasped its implications. <br><br>That's not to say I find Jensen's views palatable. The word "evil" is not one I use lightly, but it's hard to discuss Jensen's advocacy of violence and mass death in any other way. How many times do we have to hear somebody insist that X is so awful that any act is justified in opposition to it, before we grasp the fallacy there? <br><br>Blueridge, that's possible. I'd also check into the possibility that the zucchini seeds were from hybrids, which don't breed true and often turn out inedible results.<br><br>Don, argghhh indeed.

The hatcheries incubate their eggs in large electric incubators by the hundred, or thousand at a time. <br><br>This creates two potential problems for those concerned with a low-tech future. One, we may not always have access to electricity to power these incubators. And two, the process of allowing all of the young chicks to be mechanically incubated leaves the mother hens, ducks, etc, out of the process. The mothering traits, broodiness, and the instincts to raise and protect young chicks, may or may not be passed on to offspring in this type of selection process, and in practice, it is often bred out of the hatchery raised poultry.<br><br>I found this lack of good mothering in the first poultry that I purchased some years back, even in breeds that were known for good mothers. I found, quite by accident, that when different breeds crossed, their offspring often had the good mothering traits that the parents lacked. In my case, I crossed Buff Orpingtons with Red Dorkings, and got a very desirable new breed. I've talked to others who raise poultry and they have experienced similar results with their birds.<br><br>And if you haven't raised poultry, but have thought through the process I outlined above, you will want to create your new breed of poultry while you still have electricity. The first few generations of the birds I raised--because they were not good mothers--required me to hatch out the eggs in a small electric incubator.<br><br><a href=#c4340290161589962599 title="comment permalink">11/18/10, 7:18 AM</a><br><br>

The point I'd make, though, is that in pragmatic terms -- not absolute ones -- and within a particular context, one set of adaptations can be better than another, and natural selection tends to select for those. As, of course, does the variety of natural selection we call "breeding plants and animals." <br><br>Hawlkeye, no, you're not being a troll, and I sympathize with the point you're making. The art of cooperating with the intelligence in nature is the endpoint at which green wizardry aims, but it's not something that can be achieved easily, and -- crucially -- there's a huge amount of self-deception and delusion surrounding that concept in practice these days. There are far too many people who have taught themselves to mistake their own psychological projections for the voice of Nature, or God, or what have you, and far too few who have learned the necessary skills of discernment and self-analysis to get anywhere useful with this. Learning to learn from nature, to imitate nature, and to move in some sort of balance with nature are early steps on the path to what you're suggesting, and "one step at a time" is good advice here.<br><br><a href=#c8327902634030400720 title="comment permalink">11/18/10, 7:23 AM</a><br><br>

In other words, you can't go through a step that requires sacrifices in functionality and fitness in order to get to a more functional and more fit point later on. In principle, humans directing selection can do this. If you wanted a blue tomato, and you figured out that the only way to get thee was through a step that was going to barely be able to survive and reproduce, you could work through this. But in reality, two things to consider:<br><br>-- We really know so little about the integrated function of whole organisms at every one of the myriad levels that we aren't likely to actually be able to anticipate these sorts of stages and steps that might get us to a desired end.<br><br>-- These "less fit" intermediates are not actually "less fit" since by deliberately selecting for them you have actually made them "more fit" than their seemingly "better" competitors. <br><br>So a chicken with a 2 foot neck might seem ridiculously unfit on the face of it, but if it is what you want and you are selecting for it and preferentially helping the strange freakish beasts to survive and reproduce, then they really are "more fit" in their environment so long as you remain around to care for them!<br><br>Don't know if this is really relevant to small farmers and gardeners managing their own crops' genetics, of course...<br><br><a href=#c4909308053822838553 title="comment permalink">11/18/10, 8:15 AM</a><br><br>

Obviously I hit a key I didn’t intend to. <br><br>I suspect I started daydreaming about having a class that could read <i>The Origin of Species</i> in a few evenings. I once offered an A for the course to any student accurately paraphrasing a few paragraphs by Thorstein Veblen. No takers.<br><br>Nineteenth century prose style completely flummoxes most college students. In my experience, most have trouble following the content of sentences of more than fifteen words and/or with idea complexity above the level found in <i>USA Today</i>. They read words, not sentences. More significantly, since most avoid reading, their skills remain minimal. <br> <br>JMG recounts an excellent example: “It took a few baffled questions on my part to figure out that by “evolved” [the woman at the talk in the small, liberal town] meant “nice,” from which I gathered she hadn’t spent much time around children lately. When I suggested that she might consider reading Darwin’s <i>The Origin of Species</i> before using the word 'evolution' again, she looked horrified and asked, ‘Do I have to?’”<br><br>In a sad, academic sense, I loved the woman's misuse of “evolved.” It's a tell, a signal of her world view assumptions. I’ll bet this person also calls herself a “progressive” without considering that word's connotations. <br><br>Of course, Darwin gets mangled by most. Where I live, I often hear “survival of the fittest” to mean “bigger, badder, stronger—and heavily armed.” <br> <br>What really struck me though was the woman’s reaction to your suggestion to read the book. You might as well have suggested she have a root canal sans pain-killers. From what I see and read, that's how most Americans, including many of the most well-educated, view reading. <br><br>As support, I offer a Bowker headline: "Nearly One in Two Americans Read a Book Last Year, According to Bowker's 2008 PubTrack Consumer Survey.” &lt; http://www.bowker.com/index.php/press-releases/564&gt;<br><br>NEARLY one in two. <br><br>A book. <br><br>How many want to bet that book was written by Darwin?<br><br>Houyhnhnm<br><br><a href=#c4189356964815933536 title="comment permalink">11/18/10, 8:28 PM</a><br><br>

You wrote that the average person goes about their day to day activities even whilst great events are afoot.

One that you didn't mention, and that I would be interested in your comments on, is also one that seemed to slip under the radar of most Americans, most likely because it didn't occur here. I'm referring to the floods in Pakistan this past summer. From what I read and heard about this disaster, it is simply unprecedented; nothing like this has occurred in recorded history. It appears to be solid evidence that earth's climate systems are coming unhinged. What do you think?<br><br>Adrian: I still have to read <i>Walden</i> and <i>A Sand County Almanac</i>. They're sitting unread on my bookshelf. :-)<br><br>Regarding the comments by Hawlkeye and JMG's response, I wonder if humans can ever fully understand "nature" in the way Hawlkeye describes. (Are we ever going to be able to "fully cooperate" with natural processes in our work?) Even the garden that's most carefully designed to reflect and build upon natural ecosystems is going to be at best only a pale, simplified, imitation of the real thing. Although that fact should never, ever discourage us from trying, I think it's wise to keep it in mind as we work. As Wendell Berry is fond of saying, the world is a mysterious place. And even though, thanks to the work of great minds like Darwin's and others', we've learned quite a lot, the world is <i>still</i> a very mysterious place. I think we would lose our humanity if it ever became otherwise.<br><br><a href=#c6294818258531769288 title="comment permalink">11/19/10, 4:49 AM</a><br><br>

Pakistan has dealt with deforestation for a long time, but I did hear that the Swat valley, one of the places hit hardest by the floods, was just heavily deforested by the Taliban in recent years. That much rain would produce flooding in any circumstances, but it and similar events should remind us of the need to preserve the water-holding capacity of our landscapes, both for flood control and for our own use on the land. I would highly recommend the books (two volumes) "Rainwater Harvesting" by Brad Lancaster. That book is geared towards arid climates but many of the same principles apply to me in Missouri, where annual rainfall is fairly high but there's still drought periods. Some don't such as I wouldn't want to plant a tree at the bottom of a swale or depression that catches water in this climate as he does in the Southwest.<br><br>I know someone in my area that has been building swales for over ten years on a couple acres of land, and he has a streambed that used to flow just after heavy rains and then dry up. Now it flows ten months of the year, only drying up in July and August. He also has had a couple springs appear that weren't there before. My own swale-building just started in the last year, but it's something I'm working a bunch on now this time of year.<br><br>Also, the Pakistani floods were linked to the Russian heatwave, which was also completely unprecedented, significantly more so than the European heatwave of 2003. Moscow had literally a nearly two month period with temperatures consistently averaging 20 degrees Farenheit above their average. <br><br>I can't remember where it was, but I read a few detailed articles about how a super-intense Asian monsoon which caused the Pakistani floods also caused the Russian heatwave. The monsoon involves rising air, which has to sink somewhere. Typically that's over the Mediterranean region, giving that area their hot dry summers. However last summer the intensity of the monsoon changed the pattern enough that the air sank over Russia instead.<br><br><a href=#c4686417058733856239 title="comment permalink">11/19/10, 4:07 PM</a><br><br>

Thus the notion of good karma. In its original Hindu context, karma is always bad and eliminating it is one of the goals of spiritual practice, but when it came here, it became the new version of the good and bad deeds for which we would all get our just deserts on Judgement Day. Similarly, when evolution came along, popular understanding simply applied it as the new name for what had been known as the Great Chain of Being all the way back to ancient Greece. At the same time, with the prefix "spiritual", it became the new name for what had been known as spiritual progress, although people who don't do science and hear the term only in its spiritual context tend to drop the prefix and assume that "evolution" means spiritual progress, losing touch with other meanings.

Humans were part of that ecosystem from the beginning and I think it's reasonable to presume that humans have been manipulating it from the beginning, given that most other human popluations that can manipulate their environment, do. The first explorers and settlers to leave records of their experience in English described a thoroughly manipulated environment. <br><br>In the 20th century, the Western notion of "untouched wilderness" has led to the setting aside of land which humans are forbidden to manipulate, a complete novelty in terms of the history of the Northeastern ecosystem. The result is forest that's not necessarily healthy or stable. The trees are used to the Algonquin and Haudenosaunee peoples after those eleven and a half millenia of co-evolution. The ecosystem doesn't work as well without them. Something similar has been observed for the West; the controlled burns the native peoples of California used to do protected against the sort of wildfires that have plagued the region in recent decades. (The introduction of eucalyptus, perhaps the most fire-loving of trees, hasn't helped, either.)<br><br>When the environmental movement and I were young, there was a notion afloat to the effect that all that needed to happen was for us, humans, to disappear, and the ecosystem would heal itself. Well, maybe, if that healing included developing another species that would do what the native humans did. If we aspire to evolve into such a species (and this is essentially what developing a sustainable way of life means), it is ironic that the first step for many of us must be to sit down with a good book on the ecology of the sugar maple, or whatever the keystone species was on our little patch of ground, and learn to see it in terms of its network of relationships. We've lost our lore, so we need the book learning before we can go out and see actual trees with any degree of comprehension. Maybe there are people out there with enough of a feel for plant life that they can, as your old teacher described, simply ask the tree what it wants, but most of us need to let nematodes and transpiration rates into our vocabulary in order to have the slightest beginnings of a clue.<br><br><a href=#c8119733431299614076 title="comment permalink">11/19/10, 9:09 PM</a><br><br>

Former scientists, university professors and engineers found themselves using ox-ploughs to plant potatoes and wheat for survival.

I've noticed the same decline, though less pronounced. Most of the students here, after all, have been very well groomed and prepared for college by their professional parents, so they *can* write coherently. Yet many of them seem to prefer not to take the time.<br><br>My least successful assignments were those that required advance planning for a long paper: first the student has to hand in an outline and bibliography, a few weeks later a rough draft, and a few weeks after that the finished version of the same paper. This was simply beyond about 50% of my classes: many would not hand in the first two steps at all, even though they made up a substantial part of the grade; many others were incapable of sustaining interest in their topic for so long a period of weeks, and begged to change their topic from step to step of the process. <br><br>The single most striking new thing tha I noticed, however, was that from about 1995 onward many students began to challenge the very idea that it was *possible* to change people's minds at all, much less by use of reason and argument, data and evidence. "A person is going to think what he thinks, and that's the end of it. There is nothing anyone can do about it." I was never quite sure whether this was meant as a statement of fact, or an ethical norm, as if it were unethical to try to change a person's mind.
