The conversation about community that’s unfolded in the peak oil blogosphere over the last couple of weeks has quite a few interesting features. Perhaps the most interesting, at least to me, is the unanimity with which so many voices, coming from so many different viewpoints, have agreed that the role played by ordinary Americans in the collapse of American community is that of passive victim.<br><br>That unanimity, it has to be said, does not extend much further. Any number of circumstances, and no shortage of malevolent schemes, have been offered up as the reason why Americans have had their communities taken away from them. Still, the <i>Archdruid Report</i> post that started the recent conversation made an entirely different suggestion: that Americans, by and large, had not “had their communities taken away from them” at all, but actively walked away from their communities, and in fact continue to do so. It’s the fact that this suggestion is apparently about as welcome as a slug in a garden salad that fascinates me.<br><br>It’s not as though this presupposition of passivity is limited to this one topic, either. Show me a social problem in America today and it’s better than even odds that the debate around it focuses on whether it’s caused by circumstances outside of anyone’s control, on the one hand, or by the machinations of some sinister cabal on the other. That such problems might occasionally, or more than occasionally, be the logical consequence of actions actively pursued by the majority of Americans is right off the radar screen of our collective conversation – and if anybody has the bad taste to suggest that unwelcome view, the usual response is to insist that some circumstances or cabal was responsible for making Americans do whatever it was they did.<br><br>I’ve come to think, as it happens, that the portrayal of ordinary Americans as helpless victims may be one of the most significant barriers in the way of the constructive changes we desperately need to make. This is as true of community as anything else. Until we understand why it is that Americans like to speak movingly about community in the abstract, but more often than not want nothing to do with it in any concrete sense, efforts to build new communities or conserve the few we’ve got left are going to go precisely nowhere. For this reason, I want to talk a little about the reasons why people in America don’t actually want community.<br><br>One of those reasons, as I’ve suggested over the last couple of weeks, is that community costs. The benefits you get from it are exactly commensurate with the investment you make in it – in time, effort, money, commitment, and more – and as with any other kind of investment, you pay in first and get paid back later. People who don’t want to pay what community costs up front, or don’t think the payback is worth the investment, are not going to invest in it. For many reasons, some of which I’ve discussed in previous posts, the great majority of Americans have embraced these attitudes in recent decades.<br><br>Still, there’s more going on here than a simple cost/benefit analysis. In my experience, there are at least two things essential to any viable community that the vast majority of Americans find completely unacceptable. The first is an accepted principle of authority; the second is a definite boundary between members and nonmembers.<br><br>You see? Odds are you bristled with outrage the moment you read that last sentence.<br><br>Consider a traditional Quaker meeting and you can see how both these requirements function, and how necessary they are. In a Quaker meeting, the principle of authority is consensus, guided by tradition and also, much more often than not, by a core of experienced and influential members. To be a member of a meeting is to accept the authority of the “sense of the meeting” in those matters it claims the right to govern. Only those who accept that authority have the right to contribute to the consensus or participate in the life of the community. Those who consistently refuse to accept the authority of the meeting’s consensus generally get disfellowshipped – that is, they find themselves on the outside of the boundary between members and nonmembers.<br><br>The same thing is true of the communities I discussed in last week’s post, the old fraternal lodges. In a Masonic lodge, for example, the principle of authority is elective democracy limited by tradition. Certain officers, elected for annual terms, are responsible for making some decisions; others must be made by a majority vote of the lodge at a regular meeting; still others are reserved to the state grand lodge, which consists of representatives from local lodges, or to the officers the grand lodge elects. A number of issues are not subject to decision at all; they belong to what Masons call the landmarks of the Craft, core traditions accepted by every regular Masonic lodge, and cannot be changed by anyone for any reason. To be a Mason is to accept the authority of the landmarks, the lodge and grand lodge, and their officers, in that very limited sphere over which they have any say – in effect, within the four walls of a Masonic lodge. To refuse to accept that authority within its proper sphere is ultimately to cease being a brother.<br><br>Now of course it’s not too hard to think of communities in which there are more abusive principles of authority and more invidious distinctions between members and nonmembers. In contemporary discourse about social issues, these bad examples get very nearly all the air time, as a result of the very common contemporary belief that authority is by definition illegitimate and boundaries are made to be broken. Still, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and it’s worth noting that attempts at community that have not established some effective means for making and enforcing decisions, and some firm distinction between those who invest their time and energy in the community and those who simply show up for the benefits and vanish when it’s time for work to be done, pretty consistently go under.<br><br>Ultimately, as this suggests, the need for a principle of authority and a boundary between members and nonmembers is a practical issue, distinct from the moral issues often confused with it. Of course moral issues apply here, as to all other human choices, but the principle of authority can be as egalitarian as the sense of a Quaker meeting or as autocratic as “il Duce is always right;” equally, the boundary between members and nonmembers, to paraphrase Martin Luther King, can be anything from the color of their skins to the content of their characters, and much else besides; but a community that has some version of both has a good chance of success, and a community that tries to do without them will fail.<br><br>I’ ve come to think that this is perhaps the single most important reason why all the enthusiastic talk about communities in the peak oil scene, or for that matter in similar subcultures, has produced so few results. Page through the archives of <a href=http://www.theoildrum.com/ >The Oil Drum</a>, or any other peak oil site that’s been around for a while, and you’ll find plenty of people talking about how “we” ought to imitate the Amish, or medieval monasteries, or some other classic example of resilient community. Yet you won’t find a lot of proposals that such imitations ought to adopt the principles of authority and the very strict boundaries between members and nonmembers that have played so large a role in making these communities as successful as they have been, because very, very few people in our culture are willing to accept the core presupposition that underlies these things – the necessity, especially but not only in times of crisis, of placing the needs of the community ahead of the wants of the individual.<br><br>There’s much that could be said along these lines about the murky psychological roots of the American assumption that all authority is illegitimate and all boundaries unreasonable, and even more that could be said about the drastic spiritual consequences of that belief system, but neither of these conversations is really in keeping with the theme of this blog. Instead, I’d like to talk a bit about how the recent abandonment of community plays into the trajectory of decline our civilization is now following.<br><br>Arnold Toynbee, whose massive <i>A Study of History</i> remains the most comprehensive study of historical cycles, has a great deal to say about what he calls “the schism in society.” As civilizations tip over the brink into decline, he suggests, one of the core symptoms of decay is a split between the dominant minority and the rest of society. The dominant minority has lost whatever capacity it once had to inspire loyalty and emulation, but its hold on the institutions of power remains strong enough that it can’t be unseated; the rest of society, alienated from the values of the dominant minority, becomes an “internal proletariat” ripe for alternative values. When those new values emerge, usually in the form of a new religious movement, they become the framework around which new social patterns begin to coalesce – and about the time this gets well under way, the old social framework of the dying civilization, abandoned from within and assailed from without, comes messily apart.<br><br>It’s an intriguing analysis. One wrinkle Toynbee doesn’t discuss, though, is the fate of the people in between the dominant minority and the emergent internal proletariat. There are usually quite a few of them; they manage people, information, and resources within the sprawling complexity of a mature civilization; compared to the laboring classes, they have a tolerably high level of wealth and privilege, and even some influence over the political process, though nothing as much as the members of the dominant minority have at their disposal. As the schism in society opens, the ground on which they stand begins to slip away beneath their feet. On the one hand, many of them find it increasingly hard to believe in the ideals and loyalties that motivated their equivalents in earlier generations; on the other, many of them are unwilling to abandon the concrete privileges and benefits that accrue to them in their current positions. Some turn to cynicism, others to a range of uneasy attempts to serve two masters, and still others – normally the majority – simply muddle through as best they can.<br><br>Eventually, as the new value system takes shape and rises from the bottom of the internal proletariat, a good many of them will break away and align themselves with it, and provide it with the managerial and intellectual resources it needs to fulfill its own trajectory. Until a fairly late stage in the game, though, those who make that leap can count on giving up all the benefits of their place in the social order. The history of Roman Christianity provides one good example out of many. Until late in the third century, Christianity in the Roman world was largely a slave religion with a sprinkling of middle-class converts, who were regarded with the same sort of pitying contempt that most Americans direct toward those who join the Hare Krishnas. Not until the institutions of Roman society came seriously unglued did Christianity turn from a despised cult to the one remaining source of viable community in much of the Roman world; only after that happened could a Roman rhetor become a Christian bishop, say, without relinquishing the comforts of his middle-class lifestyle.<br><br>We have not reached that latter point yet. The “new values” proposed by an assortment of middle-class intellectuals in recent years all share the presuppositions of the old values they seek to replace; in terms of the Roman experience, they correspond to Stoicism, Epicureanism, and the other philosophical schools, which played a major role in the intellectual life of the Empire but contributed almost nothing to the radically different religious vision that supplanted them. A great many middle-class people in America and other industrial nations are caught in the familiar bind, no longer committed to the ideals of a declining civilization, but not yet willing to sacrifice the very tangible material benefits they get from their positions in the established order; rejecting the system in their hearts while supporting it with their actions. It’s a very awkward place to be; eventually, it will become intolerable; but until this latter point arrives, a great many people will try to have it both ways.<br><br>I’ve come to think that this dynamic lies behind a great many of the less useful cultural shifts and social trends of recent decades, and the habits of thought sketched out in this post are among these. No doubt there were plenty of Romans who responded to the conflicting demands of political and religious authority by rejecting the entire concept of authority, and dismissed the need for boundaries in the half-conscious hope that this evasion would allow them to keep a foot in both worlds while committing to neither. Certainly this sort of thing is very common today. The obsessive fixation on the isolated and supposedly independent ego that pervades contemporary culture, which Christopher Lasch once anatomized in a book more often discussed than read, has many roots; still, I suspect one of the crucial factors driving it is precisely this attempt, on the part of a great many people, to have their cake and eat it too – to enjoy the benefits of the existing order while claiming to despise its principles.<br><br>The presupposition of passivity I mentioned at the beginning of this post is one way to deal with the cognitive dissonance of this awkward position. There are already a good many others, and as the forces that are tearing modern industrial civilization apart build around us, there will doubtless be more. To the extent that it’s possible to recognize them for what they are, though, it will be easier to sidestep their more unproductive results and direct effort toward those tasks where it’s still possible to make a difference for the future.

The authors describe how the Crisis era ends: "The Crisis climax is human history's equivalent to nature's raging typhoon, the kind that sucks all surrounding matter into a single swirl of ferocious energy. Anything not lashed down goes flying; anything standing in the way gets flattened. Normally occurring late in the Fourth Turning, the climax gathers energy from an accumulation of unmet needs, unpaid bills, and unresolved problems. It then spends that energy on an upheaval whose direction and dimension were beyond comprehension during the prior Unraveling era. The climax shakes a society to its roots, transforms its institutions, redirects its purposes, and marks its people (and its generations) for life. The climax can end in triumph, or tragedy, or some combination of both.

However we are wondering if we have missed the punch line? In the first post (The Costs of Community) you asked the question:<br><br>"What, dear reader, if I were to propose a citizen's strategy for carrying out constructive social change in the United States that has worked in the past, not just once but repeatedly?"<br><br>The only strategy you've mentioned is "to organise". This is reasonable, except that you have pointed out a lot of very good reasons why it no-longer happens.<br><br>We feel like we have been left hanging.<br><br>The only way to proceed, it seems, is to leave our existing society, because it is virtually impossible to do anything meaningful within it. (We have tried our darndest for a number of years to organise our own social circle toward a more sustainable future, and our efforts have gone down like a lead balloon. Even our closest friends and family members are utterly immune to our leadership attempts, which is why we were looking forward to some concrete advice from you). <br><br>Leaving society seems like the only option to us, but it is impossible to leave the way our ancestors did, by emigrating to new lands, which leaves us with only one obvious alternative: "leaving" society while staying within it (as Jim Merkel has done). This is the path that we are following, and we have sent out an invitation to others to join us, but we won't be holding our breath.<br><br><a href=this-presupposition-of-passivity.html#c1146337831139943204 title="comment permalink">1/28/10, 2:26 AM</a><br><br>

Positive freedom tends to produce wars, negative a consumer culture.)<br><br>A society trained in negative freedom has been trained to live in the moment, only concerned about comfort.

Watt</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Well said.<br><br>I work in a boarding school, and we have clearly defined systems of authority which we nonetheless rebel against from time to time. We also have clearly defined expectations and experiences around who is a member and who is not. <br><br>Over the thirteen years that I've worked here, I've watched the glue that binds us together stretch, twist, melt, re-form, break, renew itself, and rebuild. Some people leave, new people come in, and it works, more or less, albeit with heavy stresses as you try to balance your own life against "the needs of the kids", as we say, from all over the world. <br><br>The community has had a hard time in the last few years, but we've managed in most ways to stay active and connected. As a lodge member, though, I know that it's incredibly difficult for me to contribute to more than one community; the F&amp;AM get very little of my time and treasure, compared with my school. The reasons are obvious — in a real community, you have to give yourself to it completely, in order to get any return on the investment.<br><br>Of course that's scary to Americans. And its scary at least in part because you have no way of knowing up front if the community is a cult or a front group or anything. If the community is also a business (as mine is), things become even hairier: to leave is to lose house, work, and friends all at once.<br><br><a href=this-presupposition-of-passivity.html#c3935262118429307639 title="comment permalink">1/28/10, 3:42 AM</a><br><br>

At this point I happen to be the spiritual leader of such a community, whose primary audience is America. Our experience in bringing in new members strongly aligns with your reasoning. We find that prospective members are often attracted by the potential benefits, but alienated by the need for commitment, and troubled by the ontological tension between members and non-members. We have tried to ease the transition by implementing a gradient of commitment, but find that the prospective members' family and friends frequently sabotage their involvement. Our conclusion is that there is a deep strain of anti-community conditioning in American society. The herd actively resists people splitting off and joining close-knit communities of their personal choice. They are alienated, miserable and feel like victims, but refuse to let individuals take a more proactive course toward a more connected future. At least that is how it looks from the inside of a very committed and close community.<br><br><a href=this-presupposition-of-passivity.html#c2304034580234105733 title="comment permalink">1/28/10, 4:14 AM</a><br><br>

"In my experience, there are at least two things essential to any viable community that the vast majority of Americans find completely unacceptable. The first is an accepted principle of authority; the second is a definite boundary between members and nonmembers." I see the practical rejection of this by most Protestant-derived churches as the principal reason why the Christian church cannot engage as a body with the ongoing crisis; I also suspect that the wider community as a whole won't be able to do something about the crisis until it more or less consciously distances itself from the cultural legacy of the self-same Protestantism. But as you indicate - that will involve leaving behind a great many things that people don't want to let go of yet.<br><br><a href=this-presupposition-of-passivity.html#c6823441268686955331 title="comment permalink">1/28/10, 4:48 AM</a><br><br>

And because we may never have a good understanding of how history worked (we'd have to understand the motivations of all the individuals which made history happen), we will certainly never be able to predict, in detail, how people as a group will respond to their changing circumstance in the future.

Not idly, but after a period of desperation, when one's benefits have run out. The attitude has a major shift. There are some other aspects to building and maintaining community that is worth mentioning.<br><br>Take the example of looking for a job when you really need one. You accept the authority of those who have the situation where they can hire you. You overlook their faults of people you wouldn't be able to stand if you were in a better position economically. For a brief time, when you are hired, the world is a beautiful place and the job is your salvation. Your attitude is great as is your work ethic. But at some time, when your immediate economic needs have been met, your attitude changes, the minor things start bugging you. The place sucks, your boss is an asshole. So you slack off, and inevitably someday you find yourself unemployed and the whole thing starts all over. No job, YAY! Freedom etc. Until money get short and the desperation kicks in again.<br><br>This is the same pattern lots of people have in relationships, whether a job, a girlfriend/boyfriend, etc.<br><br>Bottom line: no person, no job, no community, no family is perfect. You look past the other guys' faults for something bigger than both of you. And they look past your faults at the good you both bring to the situation. That's how friendships, careers, marriages, communities are built and how they last.<br><br>People want to fight over authority, but they won't take responsibility. That goes either for the little guy who wants the beer without hanging around to clean up after the party, and it goes for the boss who wants worker loyalty but will fire that loyal worker if it makes the boss more money. That's how communities are destroyed. With authority, you assume responsibility for those under your authority, which also means you have to care about them as you care for yourself...or MORE than yourself. But if you don't want that kind of responsibility, don't think you can handle and maintain real authority, the kind that works when the chips are down.<br><br>In most American Indian societies, one's social standing was not measured in how much you owned, but in how much you gave away.<br><br>JMG, putting on your archdruid hat, you also know how important it is to develop the unseen part of the community as well: the development of the group egregore. Besides accepting authority and boundaries and shared values, in one worldview one reason the Catholic church continues in the world, and even in the subconscious psyches (aka Lisiewski's system) of those who consciously reject being Catholic (a cultural Catholic, aka once a Catholic, always a Catholic) is the power, scale, complexity and age of the Catholic egregore.<br><br>While egregores of nations and religions (religio: to bind together, aka the import of religion as community based on boundaries and authority)<br><br>So this is a clue:<br><br>1. Consider the American egregore. Meditate on it.<br>2. Consider the lifespan of any egregore: how it begins, is built, is maintained, and dies.<br>3. Again consider the American egregore.<br><br>JMG, you know very well how even fictitious works like the Necronomicon, Star Wars, or Star Trek, not only create and maintain communities, but can create very viable egregores...some of which can create their own realities (see E.M. Forster's "The Celestial Omnibus" www.horrormasters.com/Text/a1126.pdf ).<br><br>This is a crucial point for building and maintaining communities, whether of druids or other communities of the future: the group egregore. Or in this case, the community egregore.<br><br>'Nuff said.<br><br><a href=this-presupposition-of-passivity.html#c1775107791192609590 title="comment permalink">1/28/10, 6:31 AM</a><br><br>

The dominant minority of a society consists of an alliance of factions with enough infuence to keep a majority of the levers of power either in their hands or at least not moving in a way that undercuts them. As for the internal proletariat, your membership card is in the mail. <br><br>Surfer, in my view the generational dynamics picture is a set of small ripples on the surface of some very large waves. <br><br>Ornithocrates, notice how you're using the language of victimhood -- "caught" and the like. I don't buy that. You're choosing to stand outside, and of course that's your right -- but for heaven's sake, if you're going to make that choice, don't complain about it!<br><br>LS, no, you got the punch line. I presented that option in the course of explaining why people aren't willing to use it. There is no magic cure for our predicament; it's exactly the thing that makes the fall of a civilization so agonizing that the choices that might save it are precisely the choices nobody is willing to make. <br><br>Disillusioned, thanks for the reference! I wasn't familiar with Berlin's concept -- I'll have to look into it. <br><br>Andrew, many thanks for sharing your experience. <br><br>Babaji, this precisely parallels my own experiences in a leadership role in Druidry. As you see, I've come to the same conclusion -- most people in America don't want community; they want the benefits they think they can get from community. <br><br>Sam, no argument there. <br><br>Ariel, I think the hippies blazed some useful trails and some very counterproductive ones. One of these days it would be useful to see someone attempt a thorough retrospective of the movement and see what can be learned from it. <br><br>Charles, thank you!<br><br>HeapSort, it's tough to predict the behavior of individual molecules in a heated fluid, but you can predict the behavior of the fluid to a fine degree of accuracy. It's possible to make sense in much the same way; pay attention to the large scale, and you'll see -- as Toynbee and Spengler did -- predictable regularities emerging out of the chaos of individual actions. As for prophets, er, what do you think my job description amounts to? <br><br>Lance, the employment/unemployment metaphor is a good one. As for egregors, er, I think we're pushing the boundaries hard enough as is, without dragging in technical terms from the philosophy of magic! <br><br>Still, for those who don't know the term, an egregor (some writers spell it with a final "e") is the collective personality generated by any group. The more coherent the group, the stronger the egregor, and the wider the range of effects it can have on group members, for good or ill. Some types of groups deliberately foster the growth of an egregor and use it to cause changes in consciousness in accordance with will; others simply benefit or suffer from one, depending on circumstances. <br><br>A lot of people these days go out of their way to avoid participating in one, and it's not uncommon to see people deliberately setting out to disrupt the egregor of a group to which they belong, for reasons of the sort discussed in the post. Still, it's possible to talk about all these phenomena in other ways, and that would probably be more useful here!<br><br><a href=this-presupposition-of-passivity.html#c857707893493588607 title="comment permalink">1/28/10, 7:00 AM</a><br><br>

Many people like to talk easily about so-called internet-based communities, built around facebook or myspace or whatever, but in my opinion, if you can't reach out an touch someone, you can hardly say you're in a "community" with them, although there are probably exceptions to this rule.<br><br>I'm thinking specifically here of this discussion about "sub-cultural boundaries" in <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language rel=nofollow>A Pattern Language</a>, as well as analysis done by <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.F._Schumacher rel=nofollow>E.F.

It also takes boundaries: social, geographic, even economic.<br><br>As an aside, thinking about economic boundaries to communities, I find it interesting how many poor and middle-class people, at least in the US, identify with the upper echelons of our economy, and how stridently opposed they are to tax increases on such people (e.g.). Makes no sense to me.<br><br>One final point before I go... you make the point, correctly I think, that people made a conscious decision to walk away from community. I suggest that <i>previous generations</i> made such a conscious decision. The present generation can hardly be said to have made such a decision, in many cases, because how can one walk away from something one never had nor ever experienced?<br><br><a href=this-presupposition-of-passivity.html#c2369160440148620762 title="comment permalink">1/28/10, 7:12 AM</a><br><br>

I am certainly atomized from the people I routinely deal with, with the exception of my wife, and some friends thousands of miles from me. For my part it seems to be more of an intellecutal seperation keeping me alienated. Which, to be honest, is saying a servicing of my own ego. But then what is truth, and can it be found intellectually?<br><br>James Howard Kunstler's analysis of the disintigration of community, based on reading "The Geography of Nowhere," would have soemthing to do with the impoverishment of public places. I'm not sure if it's the cause or the effect. For my part, I think the corporate takeover of all sectors of American life has a lot to do with it. We strive to "own" our house and the land it's on, and we strive to fill it with a bunch of consumer, widget, crap that we don't need. The ultimate manifisation of this would be the psychological disorder that leads to hoarding trash in the home. Our new churh has become Walmart, and the closest thing to community we have is standing in line waiting to pay.<br><br>I don't agree entirely with your assessment, JMG. Those capable of intellectual discourse on this subject are certianly not part of the proletariate. In my view they are the elite, and not necessarily because they are intelligent but rather willing to care. I work EMS for a living, and I deal with the proletariate on a daily basis. They are most certainly victims of their surroundings. Their level of consciousness is a direct result of their environment. They are sheep of the system, and without the public spaces "worth caring about," what are they to do? It seems their only possibility is the church.<br><br>I think their should be something more inclusive than church for people to belong.

There are many organizations which harbor "communities" or "tribes" such as Burning Man or the Society for Creative Anachronism to name a couple, though there are many more. Within each thematic organization, small tribal groups grow which have coherency, mutual support and group decision making as you describe. As far as rejection of "communities", it is likely that the power dynamics of hierarchical organizations are what put people off. Ask any member of a HOA who has been harassed over minor infractions while the goal of the leadership has been to support developers or people wanting to leave instead of what can be supportive of the community. Communities will and are developing but not necessarily a repeat of older hierarchical groups like the Masons. Whether these work of course, will remain to be seen. The American experience was heavily influenced by the abuse of power by the Church in Europe as well as the democratic organizations of the Iroquois Confederation and older tribal hunter/gather societies.<br><br><a href=this-presupposition-of-passivity.html#c8271279699085001508 title="comment permalink">1/28/10, 10:12 AM</a><br><br>

Sorry I'm a week behind, here are my thoughts on last week’s post; please adjust accordingly:<br><br>What's interesting in this blogosphere discussion is that no one yet has discussed *sustainable* communities. Personally, I interpret the word "community" very broadly. I think we should focus our collective discussion up front on "sustainable" community (i.e. a healthy local human society) because a lot of people today, even our leaders, are confused by the myriad un-sustainable communities that have sprung up (e.g. the internet community, the "global village," etc.). <br><br>I am glad that you are limiting the discussion to community organizations ( i.e. excluding the extended "community" of families from which they draw) because the points you make are succinct and clear. I do not want to distract from the path you are following here, but I would like to suggest that anyone interested in delving into the topic of what "community" really means (and by that I mean a sustainable local human society) read anything by Wendell Berry. Grasping what the term "healthy community" (i.e. sustainable community) means could take, who knows, a lifetime, and he has spend a lot of time on it. Another thing that is easy to lose sight of today, especially in the age of internet discussions, is that community is a concept that is always local or, in other words, always custom-made. In fact, I would venture to say it is nearly impossible to talk about "community" in general terms. <br><br>I would also suggest the Front Porch Republic website; I learned a lot about what local community means just browsing there. I would especially recommend Jeremy Beer's post on the role meritocracy has played in undermining local communities in America : http://www.frontporchrepublic.com/?p=3038 (On a side note, a recent post there by John Médaille suggests that last week's Supreme Court decision has officially ushered in an age of plutocracy in America.)<br><br>One cost to community that you did not mention is exclusion. Strong, healthy, local communities such as we had 200 years ago were necessarily fragmented and local. Not everyone could belong. This is the elephant in the room that no one today dares mention. And it’s even truer of the community organizations that draw from the community at large. For example, one of the roots of outsiders’ contempt of the Masons is simply that they were a ‘secret society.’ Even if there’s nothing secret but the secret itself, people tend to resent the keepers of secrets. Nobody likes feeling excluded. And yet it will be a necessary evil as we transition to a world of resource scarcity.<br><br><a href=this-presupposition-of-passivity.html#c7017914426564730891 title="comment permalink">1/28/10, 12:02 PM</a><br><br>

As you said before, there are a lot of other influences "greasing the skids." As I see it, this is a classic case of being careful what you wish for. One of the dominant cultural themes of recent history is the idea of liberating oneself from the prison of a small town, and its (implied) smothering conformity. If you generalize this analogy, then Americans started walking away once the opportunity availed itself. It only presented itself recently when we gained, among other things, our near-infinite mobility (again, see Beer article I mention above). Now that many people have won their freedom, they no longer have that smothering conformity, and, having forgotten about it, only see the benefits they have lost. In turn they regret their decision (I'm generalizing, it was also parents or grandparents who walked away), and blame other circumstances.<br><br>Conformity, as far as I can tell, is another issue that’s completely ignored in this blogosphere discussion. When "community" makes a comeback, I think that conformity will too, just as served its purpose for our ancestors years ago. If you found yourself the only gay, druid, or what have you, in your "small town," tough luck for you. Our descendants will have to conform to community norms that we don’t have to, just to get benefits we take for granted.<br><br><a href=this-presupposition-of-passivity.html#c3907763908118375796 title="comment permalink">1/28/10, 12:02 PM</a><br><br>

Thank you. <br><br>Couple of thoughts:<br><br>You reference the "American assumption that all authority is illegitimate and all boundaries unreasonable," as if this assumption were universal and did not require demonstration. But I think you would be hard-pressed to find any American who would agree with it. A lot of us actually do respect and obey police officers, doctors, coaches, ministers and so on. And we often do so out of love and respect, rather than cowardice or fear. I do not wholly disagree with your sentiment, but I think that reworking this in a bit softer language would not detract from your argument. <br><br>As for the rest, forgive me for being reminded of this quote from G.K. Chesterton, in one of his prophetic moments: <br><br>"It is the fashion to talk of institutions as cold and cramping things. The truth is that when people are in exceptionally high spirits, really wild with freedom and invention, they always must, and they always do, create institutions. When men are weary they fall into anarchy; but while they are gay and vigorous they invariably make rules. ... We are never free until some institution frees us; and liberty cannot exist till it is declared by authority."<br><br><a href=this-presupposition-of-passivity.html#c8052391142927211652 title="comment permalink">1/28/10, 1:13 PM</a><br><br>

Quakers struggle with community issues, too. The meeting's effort to support individuality while keeping particularly pushy individuals from "taking over" can use up a lot of energy. My meeting doesn't really have a "dismembership" procedure, but newcomers do tend to self-select. After awhile they either decide to stay or that they'd be happier elsewhere. Sometimes this can be painful. We also do have our share of controversies.<br><br>To me, belonging to my monthly meeting and the larger yearly meeting is something like staying married. In the latter, both partners need to have a commitment to the idea of marriage, and to the marriage itself, as something larger than each individual's merely selfish desires wants, etc. The rewards can be great.<br><br>Being in community, like staying married, is a discipline, a practice, that requires a maturing process on the part of the participants. I find that Quaker practice and community have, like my marriage, helped me to develop a strong identity, and have enabled me to accomplish things I could never have done on my own. And therein lies the creative tension at the heart of successful individual/group functioning. <br><br> This discussion reminds me of Wendel Berry's concept of "boomers" who head out for the frontier when they wreck the land or get restless, and "stickers" who stay put and make something of where they are, nurturing the land and building community. Most Americans are boomers, as might be expected, the US having been settled by boomers from other countries. (Which isn't to say that there aren't often excellent reasons to act boomerish). Not too many new places to go and despoil now, though.

I've mentioned it a long while back, but those historians aren't exact mainstream, even among contemporary historians who are very distanced from the establishment. I wish you would someday write something more in depth about your view of history, and to deal with some of the criticisms that have been leveled at this interpretation of history as inherently cyclical. <br><br>I'm mostly playing the devil's advocate, here. I do think that a cyclic view of history has many valid points and is much, much closer to reality than other narratives based on "progress" or somesuch, but there ARE some problems with the cyclic interpreation as well.<br><br>Wouldn't you say that the apocalptycal world view of meso-americans societies ended up being essentially true, due to outside factors beyound their control, namely the Conquistadores? You tend to dismiss apocalptycal thinking in our own society, day and age (specially from peak oiler "doomers" or somesuch), and you also dismiss the UFO phenomenon as essentialy something created by our own culture (which I agree with, btw), but if you went back to 1480 in Mexico and said similar things about the Aztec calendar and the gods from beyond the sea, you would be, in fact, wrong, wouldn't you say? <br><br>Anyway, just wanted to hear more about your thoughts on the subject.

The short form is that it will disgust and offend you. The religious movements that pick up the pieces from a failing civilization are generally those that no properly enculturated member of that civilization would even think of joining.

They're the exception that proves the rule, the far end of the probability curve of social collapse. My critique of the current round of apocalyptic thinking is that it fails to reflect the impact of the factors that tend to slow down collapse, just as theories of perpetual progress fail to reflect the impact of the factors that are driving collapse in the first place.

I am still completely amazed, not only by the quality of your posts, but also by the extreme quality of the people that comment here. [This does not imply agreement, of course]<br><br>2. Related to my previous comment and your response: I find interesting the dissonance between the formal and the informal. As an example, think about an hypothetical organization that propagandizes liberty, but then internally/informally (ie, in day to day reality) is very dogmatic (I've also see the opposite, by the way). More often than not, the description that a certain community makes of itself has very little to do with its internal reality.<br>One of the thing that haunts me is trying to devise ways to detect these inconsistencies as soon as possible. And also, how to assemble an organizational and cultural structure that is reasonably resistant to dogmatism and totalitarianism (assuming that such a thing can be coded in a community "DNA").<br><br>3. Today I was reminded of the works of Paul Feyerabend.

I owe most of them to Lewis Lapham's <i>Fortune's Child: A Portrait of the United States As Spendthrift Heir</i> (1994) and writings of Paul Fussell, e.g. <i>Class</i> (1992). <br><br>It troubles me that the trend remains strong.

While their general lack of academic achievements depresses me, many eagerly dive into community service, and, at least in my area, this trend is rising.

I often wonder when you have the time to write this sort of stuff. Thanks for sharing your thoughts as they are valued by the blog community<br><br>Australia has a rotten record of per capita energy consumption, you are right. But often what is overlooked is the sheer distance that 20 odd million Aussies in a country the size of the USA have to struggle with, and the crappy and severely inefficient infrastructure we have. Both these limiting factors push our energy consumption way up. One is geography - so not a lot we can do about it. The other is government driven - so until the masses vote for independents to hold the balance of power in our Upper House, nothing will really change there. I still expect Australia will top the excessive energy useage Roll of Honour for another 20 years or so.<br><br>An excellent read on why Australia is heading for the skids was publised in the mid 1970's by a well known historian called Geoffrey Blainey. The book is called "The tyranny of distance" and is pretty relevant to any country I think, not just those down Under.

How is it to be tested? I think that explaining the passivity as dealing with pre-collapse <i>cognitive dissonances</i> is premature. Do concerned <i>oildrummers</i> look scared particularly for their own personal future? The American culture of authority trashing has no common vibes with <i>panicking</i> intellectuals. Its intensification and peculiar resonance with post-McCarthian conformism rather point to the elephants you like to dismiss.<br><br>Your analysis of community costs can be amended with <i>relative considerations:</i> people now are very sensitive in who is contributing less or benefiting more than yourself. Miniscule perceived <i>injustices</i> halt cooperative or <i>tic-for-tac</i> relations frequently, whatever potential loss of mutual benefit. And if you give a slight way, the other will seek to capitalize his <i>theta-to-eta promotion</i>. People seem to be lazy (or quite unable) to assess <i>absolute</i> costs and benefits of cooperative relations, but they enjoy <i>being smart</i> in gaining relative points. Ultimately, the established cultural-economic paradigm tells that no care should be taken about common goods or any <i>egregores</i>. That is the <i>wisdom</i> of Darwinian, economic and game theories that trickled down to the American and global societies. <br><br>Connections between Maslow’s <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs rel=nofollow>hierarchy of needs</a> and Patanjali yoga limbs or Leary’s <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8-Circuit_Model_of_Consciousness rel=nofollow>eight circuit model</a> might me very parallel after all, in that once basic bio-survival needs are satisfied, people start using their <i>primate brains</i> of social comparisons heavily. Evidence for this can be noticed in the later Communist societies, for example. A discipline of certain rituals to raise a collective consciousness looks indeed useful then.<br><br>The fate of elite and middle class people must vary a lot under a collapse, if only because awareness of the collapse would be so inhomogeneous. Some intellectuals would show appropriate public concern but get no respect. At least some resourceful individuals (and organizations) would keep themselves informed and quite prepared, but they won’t share their considerations publicly. Deceptive campaigns and manipulation of discussions, concerns are possible. Most people would not put <i>“ends of the world”</i> high on their priority lists for various reasons, including reliance on the <i>wisdom of crowds</i> and <i>responsible</i> opinion makers. Most people will appreciate aptly the inevitable or leveraged changes late in the game. And as the Chinese saying goes, every crisis is an opportunity, especially if you have privileged information or resources.<br><br>The raw forces of <i>inner proletariat</i> can be practically anticipated and directed. Some say, <i>every revolution is betrayed and discredited</i>; this process is hardly resolved by a proletariat alone. The French revolution is a <a href=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China_Business/KK13Cb02.html rel=nofollow>good example</a>. Mind you - I am not in a hopeless mood.<br><br>In the example of Christianity we see how its fortunes changed rather top-down, with the Emperor Constantine. Just 20 years ago the <a href=http://bibleprobe.com/theban.html rel=nofollow>Theban legion</a> was executed.

Theirs is essentially a tourist’s view of the world-not a perspective likely to encourage a passionate devotion to democracy.”<br><br>The fact that our meritocracy rewards most those at home in the world of “abstractions and images” has further isolated our new elites from the rest of society by their insulation from manual labor. “The thinking classes are fatally removed from the physical side of life,” and indeed, only under such circumstances could such academic theories as “the social construction of reality” gain any purchase on the mind, concludes Lasch.<br><br>Another serious disadvantage to rule by the “best and brightest” is that, unlike the older, premeritocratic elite, with its codes of chivalry and concern for honor and family, the new elite, thinking that it owes its power to intelligence alone, has “little sense of ancestral gratitude or of an obligation to live up to responsibilities inherited from the past.” It “thinks of itself as a self-made elite owing its privileges exclusively to its own efforts.”<br><br><br>If you consider that true then that helps explain the position that there is no ONE set of elites, but a whole group, which share an underlying mind set, while pursuing different agendas.<br><br><a href=this-presupposition-of-passivity.html#c6666902626552194941 title="comment permalink">1/29/10, 9:11 AM</a><br><br>

That's my take on the reason why the actual behavior of an organization often has no relation at all to its ostensible values. A for Feyerabend, it's been too long since I've read him -- thanks for the reminder.<br><br>Hounynym, thanks for the link -- and the reflections. <br><br>Richard, it's anyone's guess at this point. Fundamentalist Christianity might have become the vehicle for the schism here in the US, but twice now -- once in the 1920s, and then again in the last few decades -- its leaders have been all too willing to sell out for a few scraps from the table of power. Now? Hard to say. <br><br>Riddley, it's only because most contemporary attempts at community lack boundaries and a principle of authority that one person with a character disorder can bring them down. I've repeatedly seen communities built along older lines, faced with such people, move swiftly to isolate and expel them, and emerge unscathed. <br><br>As for the militias, Sparta's the wrong metaphor. You're watching the first stirrings of the barbarian warbands of Dark Age America. <br><br>Sprite, thank you! It's certainly a factor that Australia and Canada are both very sparsely settled, but there are other countries that can say the same, and don't have the same sky-high energy consumption per capita. My guess is that the role these two countries play as members of the inner circle of US allies has at least as much to do with it. <br><br>Das Monde, the theory's been built for quite a while; it's just being sketched out here. How is it to be tested? The course of events is the only test available. <br><br>Jason, early Buddhism in China comes to mind -- it was just as offensive to the Confucian elite (though they later found ways of coming to terms with it, of course). Polytheist versions of the same thing tended to work by subtler shifts -- for example, the emergence of Osiris as a central focus of popular devotion in Egypt formed an effective counter to the pharaonic cult of Amun-Re. <br><br>Mark, thanks for the quote! It's spot on -- though it will take a lot more than 10%. <br><br>Bmerson, every community is at least a little corrupt, at least a little oppressive, and at least a little unfair, because every human being can be described in the same terms. If we expect our communities to live up to ideals we ourselves don't follow, we're guaranteed to be disappointed. Thus it's going to take hard necessity, and the extinction of some comfortable but dysfunctional attitudes, before communities really become possible again. <br><br>Raven, true enough. <br><br>Dltrammel, good. Lasch's analysis has had quite a bit of influence on mine, as you may have guessed.<br><br><a href=this-presupposition-of-passivity.html#c8205315045301271390 title="comment permalink">1/29/10, 11:10 AM</a><br><br>

Many are well aware of what they leave behind despite all the enticements of the city lights. The major culprits are policies of cheap food, unsustainable ressources extraction by big business and oblivious consumers. Those have destroyed the small town economy: family farm disapearance, fishery collapse, forest clearcutting for pulp and timber etc...For example, the Haiti rural exodus to Port-au-Prince had much more to do with the eradication of the Creole pig and the dumping of american rice and sugar than a desire to escape hometown conformity. The same forces were and are still at work from the dumping of cheap corn in Mexico to the fishery collapse in Newfoundland outports. The vast majority of people leave their hometown when they realize they have lost the battle of eking a living. Twenty years ago there were 25 dairy farms in my town, now, six are left. A friend of mine, one of the last horse harness and bridle maker in his region, closed shop two years ago when the market was flooded with cheap crap from China and India. One of his supplier, a Amish from Pensylvannia phoned him to ask why he was not ordering anymore metal hardwares. His business had seen a huge drop in sale as well. This is how, bit by bit, the rural communities get hollowed out and die. <br>In a way, it's quite ironic for people to look for all kind of far fetched conspiracies instead of examining with a critical mind their pattern of consumption.

Wasn’t Martin Luther King only possible on the upslope of an ascending nation? Isn’t his vision of humanity no more natural a state of affairs than golf courses in the desert, historically speaking? As the abundance that made such utopian ideas believable recedes, won’t many of the cultural conditions associated with the “progress” of recent decades also recede? I see this trend all around me – a return to tribalism, a closing of ranks, a rejection of outsiders, and suspect that this is where we’re headed if things unwind the way people here seem to expect. Furthermore, I wonder if people here are really ready for such a post-progressive world, since it really is rather nasty in a lot of ways. It seems to me that the survivalist/militia types that Mr. Greer likes to deride are really ahead of the curve in a lot of ways, and like the Taliban post-progressives in Pakistan will come out big winners in a post-collapse world.<br><br><a href=this-presupposition-of-passivity.html#c6335208545902508483 title="comment permalink">1/29/10, 12:35 PM</a><br><br>

People in my country and elsewhere in former Eastern bloc surely rebelled <i>primarily</i> against authority they see illegitimate, against authority unable to fulfill big promise of <i>consumerist</i> paradise richer than that one present on the West. Maslowian interpretation of failings of the Soviet imperium you offered was always typical illusion of reformist pro-system intellectuals around <i>Novoe vremya</i> magazine or something of the sort. You can criticize both post-stalinist "communism" and western welfate state as two incarnations of the same industrial consumer society. <i>But for me, the main lesson here is, how completely the state failed trying to master everything, especially making big power structures "humanly warm" and compensating for weaknesses of the market.</i> It isn't the last word of the history, sure, but Russia is now failing again (see its contemporary demography, economy, culture, or even military) with essentially the same attempt based this time not on the "communist", but on nationalist ideology. <br><br>So JMG is right, we have to accept some forms of authority and boundaries, but main risk I see here is <i>to focus again on some kind of centralistic and normalized reference mythos as a source of all meaning in society of uprooted individuals</i>, for example nationalist one. This was the case of big catastrophe called "communism" - and in effect, society we both used to live was spiritually undead for decades. <br><br>Destruction of primary groups, in fact, represents common fate of all western/westernized "faustian" societies - we can see it from ancient Greece till USSR - but the last case was the extreme one.

But then the question is: What was the mission of <i>managing</i> communists at the later stage? (Why everyone worries about <i>intellectuals</i> that much?!) It seems now that higher communist functionaries did not mind the collapse and color revolutions at all. Generally, they were in step with the <i>revolutions</i> faster than the hopeful masses. If you look now who are the comfortable winners of the wild transition, the majority of them are former communist functionaries. Yep, some fresh faces made it as successful businessmen or politicians - but rather few compared with what was <i>revolutionarily</i> promised. And surely, not all communist <i>specialists</i> or intellectuals fare well now - rather lucky of them can stay in disregarded apartments in central Prague or Vilnius and spend their time on internet in public libraries. But the fact is: an <i>upper-middle</i> subclass of Socialist societies are the most comfortable winners of the new promises.<br><br>This is interesting because JMG argues that elite and middle classes have most uncertain and perilous times during a collapse. As long as the Soviet collapse is widely considered as a natural example of destined collapse, these concrete details can be tested on it. And what about the issue of <i>passivity</i> during the same collapse? With all respect to <i>velvet revolutionaries</i>, was it people’s activity that pushed the collapse? Will <i>resilient grassroots</i> of the global industrial collapse be a very different folk?<br><br><a href=this-presupposition-of-passivity.html#c432698173822587963 title="comment permalink">2/1/10, 2:10 AM</a><br><br>

With multitude of other closely related intentional communities, ecovillages etc. that are build on and continue the hippie revolution values and practices which most often based on anarchistic consensus-making even if they don't self-identify as anarchists. Such political labels rather belong to realm of anthropologists and other political scientists, and this approach should remind us that strictly shared "authority" - if the word is even justified here and I cannot but question that - is very different beast from any and all hierarchic authority. It is good to keep in mind and be critical of each of our lenses of interpretation based on our identities and experience, and perhaps experience coming from hierarchic druidic and masonic orders don't give the best qualifications to describe non-hierarchic communities that do not have even common belief system. <br><br>The Rainbow Gatherings are very interesting fenomenon as the yearly main event emerges as community for a relatively short period and then vanishes leaving no traces at the location - or often leaving the local ecosystem in better condition than before the gathering. This could at least partly explain why the border between in-tribe and out-tribe is not or if it is, less strict than you seem to be suggesting. The Rainbow community is open to anyone that chooses to come to the gathering and to my knowledge no one has been ever turned away, so instead of boundary it would seem more justified to speak about inclusive openness.<br><br>But what is perhaps the most crucial challenge of your thoughts about authority and borders of communities, at least in context of Rainbow Gatherings, is that no one can claim authority to tell what Rainbow Gatherings are - participants can only share their unique experience and point of view. This may be a fine point that don't open easily, but in essence it might be that the experience of belonging to Mother Earth and community does not exhort to presenting authoritative top-down views but each participant speaking, singing and dancing at and from the grass root level. <br><br>In my view and experience a practicioner of certain ancient arts does not really become a druid or shaman with perceived "authority" merely by hierarchic succession and position, but by fully surrendering and belonging to a community of a tribe with roots deep in the land and the ecosystem and/or "spiritworld". No matter how valuable its insight and understanding may be, shamanhood becomes social function of a shaman only when a community of people and spirits so chooses, invites and accepts.<br><br>Thank you for the opportunity to share these thoughts and I hope all potential readers keep in mind that what I've said is just one proberbial blind man touching the elefant.

It has been, frankly, a revelation, &amp; I wish to join the chorus of folks who have praised your insightfulness. You have even given me hope for the future. Not because the future you outline is pleasant, but because it actually exists. I had previously been swayed by the logic of the transhumanists &amp; believed in the approach of a technological Singularity, but was sensible enough to realize that after such an event there would be no place for any actual people, that not only our bodies but also our minds would eventually be replaced by increasingly specialized machines. I was afraid that within my lifetime I would be obsolete, that I would not have nearly the social power even to prosper from the machines’ proliferation but would become as marginalized as a Haïtian farmer is today, and that all my friends and family would be pushed to the same position. You, however, have given me an effective intellectual defense against such terror.

Several times in this blog you have said that industrial society is the greatest economic "bubble" of all. But what about life itself? Life on Earth requires constant inputs of energy from both the sun &amp; the geothermal cycles, and which promises immortality on those sequences of nucleic acids that will participat As the 2nd Law states, all that life is doing is hurrying (in however slight a way) the heat death of the universe, as life is more efficient at turning ambient energy to useless entropy than bare rock and atmosphere.<br><br>So isn't all this talk of sustainability meaningless? I mean this as a serious question, not merely as some sarcastic, trollish jabbing. All that sustainability does is delay the inevitable, and you’re on the record as thinking little of those who long for immortality. What does it matter if it is our grand-children who are the last generation, or our great-grandchildren? If the end of life is inevitable, why bother with sustainability? Why not make like Nero, and fiddle while Rome burns? How long do you wish to postpone the end of life on earth? After all, an ecosystem populated solely by bacteria is probably more efficient at its energy use than one with eukaryotes in it, to say nothing of people. Of course, you &amp; I both would probably much prefer a world with people to one with just bacteria, but isn't this already an admission that we're willing to trade life for pleasure? How much life are we willing to trade for how much pleasure? Surely an argument can be made that the 1st worlders who enjoy pleasure now in exchange for death later are actually making the correct choice, and that the amount of future life that they have traded is balanced out or perhaps even exceeded by the pleasure they've received in return. You can feel free to put on you archdruid hat if you want to, but I would be impressed if that could help. After all, isn't a belief in the sanctity of nature just another attempt to deny the hard reality of the investment bubble we're caught up in, different only in form from the arguments that economists make about the power of the market? And any hypothesized "world of the spirit" that is exempt from the rules of thermodynamics is just another argument for a perpetual motion machine, and you've already come down rather harshly against those.<br><br>I do not profess to believe in the above nihilism as thoroughly as it seems, but what I do believe in is intellectual integrity, and I long for a comprehensive argument that'll knock it out of the water for good. I have arguments against it and responses to it, but none of them is a knock-out blow, and even the lot of them together are not entirely satisfactory.<br><br><a href=this-presupposition-of-passivity.html#c8693291484350860849 title="comment permalink">2/1/10, 8:30 PM</a><br><br>

Hill, thank you, but I think you're missing my point. People don't need to "find, join, or build community" -- they need to meet their neighbors, drop the fantasy of individual autonomy, and let community evolve, and they'll do that when, and only when, they have to. Trying to "build community" is like trying to manufacture a tree: you get a simulacrum, nothing more. <br><br>Edde, next time you're out there fixing the boardwalk, ask them!<br><br>Spark, that's the understatement of the century. New Zealand might just escape, but Australia will almost certainly go under in the face of armed and starving mass migrations from Indonesia and Malaysia. If your islands do get mass migration, don't expect them to settle down quietly next to the current residents, any more than the Saxons settled down quietly next to the Welsh!<br><br>Tkraemer, thank you. As for rhetors, that's an unfilled job description right now. Do you know of any volunteers? <br><br>Das Monde, I thought it was pretty much an open secret at this point that the various color revolutions were bought and paid for by the US. They're not a particularly good model for the crisis ahead of us; the aspect of the Soviet experience that deserves, and gets, attention is the economic and public health dimensions of the collapse, which are likely a good model for the future of America. <br><br>Santeri, every major alternative movement in American history has left behind a lingering minority that clings to the movement when everyone else turns away. The Rainbow Gatherings are a classic example, the last fading echo of the Sixties counterculture. My interactions with the Rainbow Tribe, which go back to the early 1980s, suggest to me that there are strict boundaries and powerful authority structures there -- they're simply covert, as usually happens in groups that disavow such things. Still, to each their own, and if that approach works for you, by all means pursue it. <br><br>Ape, of course sustainability is a relative term. That doesn't make it meaningless. You, personally, are going to die someday; that doesn't make it a waste of your time to take reasonable steps to maintain your health and fitness, so your odds of having a long and healthy life are good. In the same way, our species will go extinct someday, and life on Earth will go extinct someday; in the meantime, though, there's a lot of difference between actions that help maintain the stability of the biosphere and human society, and those that undermine both. <br><br>Denisaf, you're preaching to the choir! Natural laws beat economics every time; the question is how many people get that while there's still a chance to do something useful with the knowledge.<br><br><a href=this-presupposition-of-passivity.html#c8361265322007918853 title="comment permalink">2/2/10, 7:08 PM</a><br><br>

When you speak of the hay days of local lodges and community activism, there were a few things in place at that time that are absent now.<br><br>People tended not to move or change jobs. They got a job, worked there for 40 years and retired. They bought a house, stayed there that 40 years and retired in the same house. Today, the average first time home buyer only stays in that house for 3 years before moving. Your average worker today will change jobs 6-8 times in their working life. You had the same doctor, teachers, governing officials, and community leaders for the duration.<br><br>In that scenario, the effort you put into the community did pay dividends in the long run. But people aren't in their community for the long run anymore, so the attitude is simply, "why put in the work?"<br><br>This is compounded by the "new" communities prevalent on the internet. People don't need to see their neighbors, they have 2,642 facebook friends. These, I guess, are communities by technical definition, but don't really have any of the benefits that real people meeting in real places doing real, meaningful things have.<br><br>I guess the question in my mind is how does one foster community in an ever increasingly transient world?<br><br><a href=this-presupposition-of-passivity.html#c1029289583152311496 title="comment permalink">2/2/10, 9:42 PM</a><br><br>

They started "revolutions" of 1989 themselves, so they are the winners. They also managed to <i>isolate</i> most ordinary people one from another, to transform "lonely crowd" into set of individualists of high consumerist expectations, willing to blindly delegate new acquired democratic power to those able to apply the finest art of jaw-jaw and empty promises (originally made by Friedrich von Hayek, Chicago boys and international financial institutions). <br><br>In the USA, throughout the social stratum of contemporary élites, you probably can't find much <i>true</i> willingness to transform society into something completely different - so this eastern experience dosn't fit to Americans very well.

Best discussion on these topics that I've encountered in a long while. One point that I didn't see (tho possibly missed) is that our "walking away" from the small town communities due to the new increased ability to re-locate (combined with job pressures) is that towns (not to mention cities!)are now much more heterogeneous, which lessens the likelihood of forming local communities... I'd been musing about this from another angle, and realized your concepts overlapped. <br><br>What I'd been pondering was whether our "inclusivity" and insistence on "tolerance" (which is a noble and mostly wonderful utopian ideal) might in some ways be wearing down community and in fact backfiring. I wondered whether it would be better to go back to more homogeneous towns and areas (and I realize this is theoretical) -- say, a town that says it is anti-gay...For the record, that would be a town I wouldn't go within a 100 miles of, but that's the point -- it would be openly against my values and I'd avoid it (rather than stumbling into it and regretting it). And the people there would be less likely (maybe?) to strike out at the world if they could have their little world... maybe there'd be towns where the church bells rang for prayers... I know this happens on some level already (I just moved to a small, very right-wing town; I am not real close to any of my neighbors ;-})... but what if we just accepted that people do need to be around "their kind" and let the groups congregate and even segregate? Do we all have to have everything and every place? It's a wild thought I know... and I dont' believe that splitting off would be any excuse for unequal division of goods... but all this talk about community seems to be ignoring the very real tensions in just about every location, due to the increased pressure to accept everyone (or, perhaps, I just come from a rather politically correct location in the Pacific NW... come to think of it, my upbringing in NJ was much less than tolerant of others...) <br><br>I guess, since I agree with most that society is about to crash (whether slow or fast -- it's unsustainable), this might be one of the first things that happens: the majority "drives out" the "irritating" minority so that they can survive in the way that feels most real, most comfortable for them.

It is the most intelligent (clearly a moderated forum) most comprehensive, least flame-and-blame-filled discussion of this kind of topic I have yet seen. Thanks specifically for trying to link Americans, such a future-obsessed people (regardless of where we fall on the traditional political spectrum, or what our class or ethnicity is) to our history. I would only add one caveat there; much as I have also learned to find the historical example essential to a sense of human possibility, I think we still have to re-conceive how human history flows: in my view, in something like a spiral, not in circles or a straight line. So that it may actually not be enough to say “this was done before, in this society, in what seem to be even more difficult circumstances” (and really, as you yourself note, it’s the difficulty itself, the compelling need, that has always driven the move to more collectivism). We see historical patterns recur but always with crucial differences that were not previously present (time is still a one-dimensional arrow), which greatly alter what actually happens in any historical moment. In the global north we have been on a spiral farther and farther away from the material conditions that compelled more community in our forebears. There is a dawning awareness that this won’t last—but for now it still surrounds most of us, densely, almost impenetrably. But I totally agree that examples of what was once achieved collectively are still an extremely useful and inspirational thing to have—and will be more so in a time of more broadly compelling need. It is so important for modern social movements to stop reinventing the (literally) bloody wheel. <br><br>End of Part 1--sorry, much food for thought here!<br><br><a href=this-presupposition-of-passivity.html#c7815686128866235376 title="comment permalink">2/3/10, 6:27 PM</a><br><br>

During the civil war the sense of community in areas that were bearing the brunt of the war (mostly rural, inhabited by poor farmers) and had chosen to ally themselves against the repressive government was intensely strong. People’s identity was so collectively defined that they astounded and inspired us with what they were able to achieve and the spirit of dignity and resilience and even joy they evoked in doing so. The carrot: they survived, on their land, with what was left of their families and their neighbors, and along the way they achieved a never-before held sense of purpose and self-worth.<br><br>After the war was over, the stick withered, but so did the carrot. When people had the opportunity to move to doing things more independently they did. There were many traumas suppressed during the war—being forced to deal with people on “your” side who’d been abusive, people who were corrupt, people who were just tedious. Once people had the ability and the economic incentive again to get further away from each other they did so. <br><br>So I want to absolutely second your acknowledgment of compelling need. In the discussion responses, while I saw a lot of excuses for our lack of community, relative freedom from material need was not often cited. Yet our blip on the historical timeline is precisely the age of the materially richest generation the earth has ever seen (in the US if not by any means in the majority of the world’s population). For now our material environment is one that still intensely reinforces our ability to avoid one another—most of us anyway. Spiritual/emotional need for community is also immensely strong and we see it returning with a vengeance, but on its own I don’t think it’s strong enough to compel most materially comfortable people to intertwine their lives very much, nor as you point out, to create particularly healthy communities if they do. <br><br>End of Part 2...<br><br><a href=this-presupposition-of-passivity.html#c1314436731417030500 title="comment permalink">2/3/10, 6:29 PM</a><br><br>

Circle-meetings with talking stiks in turn share a lot with other dialogue-practices, and I'd like to think your blog is also one type of dialogue circle. But I don't share your sentiment that these kinds of phenomena are just fading remnants of a single hippie revolution.<br>The constant gripe and rumours about "insider" circles of hidden leaders nearing conspiracy theories are very common in organi(/zations)sms and gatherings that practice consensus making. The gripes are often justified, to some extent at least, so it is a well known problem that people, especially those participating in consensus circles are and should be well aware and share responsibility to keep things more open and mutual. False expectations and projections are the other side of the issue. But nobody ever said consensus building is or should be easy! :D<br><br>The starting point of this discussion about community is political and psychological, but the issue of authority and boundaries in the anarcho-spiritualistic circles I have experience from goes beyond politics and psychology, at least when defined narrowly, into the issue of holistic ecology of sustainable way of life as community of peoples sharing and participating with larger community of life and being and belonging and how this can be experienced and shared. Authority and setting boundaries for a sustainable way of life is in essence godly business and as such can come only from a sense of whole and holy. <br><br>What I'm now very vaguely thinking and sensing and suggesting is the idea growing experience of shamanhood, druidery etc. not as an individual but as a larger Circle of sharing and learning together with no formal social role of an individual or single shaman or druid in charge of rites, without hierarchos - which by no means excludes the occational role of taking public hierarchic responsibility when an individual has something meaningfull to share and knows how to avoid ego getting in the way . But I'm also all too familiar of rivalry politics of stabbing behind the back in neoshamanistis, neodruidic etc. new age circles where leadership issues of credibility together with issues of self doubt tend to rule the day and with this experience I have come to believe that way of anarchistic sharing and learning together is more fruitfull and healthy than formal hierarchies - that got us in the mess we now are. "Messiah is the one who leaves a mess behind" as U.G.Krishnamurti said. I haven't yet met a neoshaman or neodruid or any other guru that is 100 percent at home with his or her Shadow and projections and mirrors - nor do I think we should we expect such perfection from any of our beloved ones. Perfection is the worst enemy of good. :)<br><br>Aho Mitakuye Oyasin,<br>Santeri<br><br><a href=this-presupposition-of-passivity.html#c7028760813627009352 title="comment permalink">2/3/10, 6:32 PM</a><br><br>

Great, unromantic portrayal of a post-collapse society where two paradigms emerge, both of them fitting that description, one clearly fascistic and the other more egalitarian, anarchistic, more spontaneously evolving, if you will. Neither has effaced the other at the end of the book; egalitarianism barely hangs on by its fingernails, always threatened by authoritarianism, just like now-- go figure. Collapse is no respecter of democratic ideals, those who think "we" (whoever that is by then) will get a better shot post-collapse than we have now at achieving them, even in small communities of proximity, should read it as an extremely eloquent and still timely cautionary tale. <br><br>Anyway, thanks again. I’m so glad I found this discussion. Let’s all us thoughtful types try to ground ourselves a little more in our immediate reality and go from there, absurd and filled with abstractions as we may find that reality; it’s where we live now; it’s where we have to start.<br><br><a href=this-presupposition-of-passivity.html#c7998758476257390783 title="comment permalink">2/4/10, 1:46 PM</a><br><br>

The version at http://www.ic.org/pnp/cdir/1995/23joreen.php was written in 1996, generalized and boiled down from an early version written specifically for the feminist community in 1970, back when it was called the women's liberation movement. I think the early version, with its greater wealth of detail about how inner circles develop in theoretically egalitarian groups, is the more valuable, once you get past the specific politics of that specific time. It's at http://scriptorium.lib.duke.edu/wlm/tyranny/.<br><br>My own experience with the early days of the Northeast Rainbow Council perfectly illustrate the way lack of a boundary between members and nonmembers encourages the tyranny of structurelessness. Rainbow Council is the meeting of those who put on the Gatherings. It is designed with the same "All are welcome, all will be treated with love and respect" super-inclusive values as the Gathering itself. The Northeast Regional group met for the first time in 1989, following the 17th national Gathering. That first meeting was relatively focused and businesslike, the first of a series aimed at putting on a regional Gathering in the Northeast, an aim successfully achieved. By the time the Council met to plan the third Northeast Regional Gathering, word was out that this was a meeting at which anyone could say anything and be certain of being listened to respectfully by a large audience. As a result, many new people showed up who had nothing to contribute but merely wanted attention. Northeast Regional Rainbow Council became a massive dysfunctional group therapy session, seldom on topic and incapable of accomplishing much of anything. All the real planning work was done that year in private conversations among the longtime volunteers, deliberately bypassing the official Council meetings. This was the last year in which I participated.<br><br>(To be continued...)<br><br><a href=this-presupposition-of-passivity.html#c2753397202649702494 title="comment permalink">2/18/10, 6:48 PM</a><br><br>

One buys one's way in. There's no sorting for intention, responsibility or trustworthiness. One advantage that tribal villages had over their modern counterparts is that tribal groups, being economically collective and recognizing no property basis for membership, could banish people who made themselves a burden on the emotional life of the group. <br><br>At the same time, tribal peoples generally had structures separate from their decision-making apparatus for dealing with emotional issues. Americans tend to have their heads in the sand when it comes to the emotional needs of groups, to deny the existence of such needs or to label any concern for them as "California woo-woo" or some similar euphemism for malingering. This illustrates the strong military element in American culture, focused on material results, contemptuous of less tangible concerns. On the other hand, when a contemporary group gets Californian enough to set up a structure for working out emotional needs, the members generally find that the handling of practical matters is greatly improved. The activist organizer Starhawk, when asked what she thought of the increasing popularity of 12-step programs in her community, reported that political meetings got down to business much more quickly. <br><br>One of the commonplaces of the intentional communities movement is that, of those set up in the Sixties, the secular ones offering a lot of individual freedom and few or no rules have mostly collapsed, while many of the ones with a spiritual basis are still around. More than one writer on the subject has attributed this difference to overt structure in the spiritual communities (encompassing clear distinctions of membership and some principle of authority even when these were not mentioned explicitly) and lack of it in the secular ones. However, it is my contention that care for the emotional needs of the group, usually incorporated into the spiritual practices, plays at least as great a role in giving spiritual communities greater resilience.<br><br><a href=this-presupposition-of-passivity.html#c6219042622069809297 title="comment permalink">2/18/10, 6:52 PM</a><br><br>

These two institutions can claim to be havens in a heartless world only to the extent that the world remains heartless. Church and family help is also generally conditional on behavior, distinguishing between "deserving" and "undeserving" recipients and therefore functioning as a means of controlling individual behavior, pressuring people to stay in the "deserving" category. The trouble with government largesse is that it's available to everybody and thus it undermines the authority of church and family and respect for tradition in general.<br><br><a href=this-presupposition-of-passivity.html#c3921941805711944675 title="comment permalink">2/18/10, 7:39 PM</a><br><br>
