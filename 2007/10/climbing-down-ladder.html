Last week’s <span style="font-style: italic">Archdruid Report</span> post raised the possibility that future societies might be able to maintain a relatively high level of technology without falling into the trap of relying on extravagant use of nonrenewable resources, the basis of our present industrial society. The dream of building a civilization of this sort – an ecotechnic society, to use the term I coined in that post – has been cherished by a good many people in alternative circles for years now, and not without reason.<br><br>Behind that dream lies a canny bit of philosophical strategy. Central to the rhetoric used to justify today’s social arrangements in the industrial world is a forced dichotomy between the alleged goodness of enlightened, technologically advanced industrial societies and the alleged squalor of primitive preindustrial life. Many of today’s critics of industrialism fall into the trap of accepting the dichotomy and simply reversing the value judgments, as though it’s possible to break out of a dualistic way of thinking by standing the dualism on its head. <br><br>The cleverness of the ecotechnic dream is that it breaks out of the dichotomy altogether. In the jargon of modern Druid philosophy, it turns an unresolved binary into a balanced ternary. In less technical terms, it proposes a third option that borrows many of the best qualities of the two sides of the dichotomy, and thus blows the dichotomy out of the water by widening the field of choices, not just to three but to infinity. The question stops being a matter of accepting one of two whole systems, in a choice that excludes all alternatives; it becomes a matter of picking and choosing among a dizzyingly large array of factors that go together to make up a future society.<br><br>The vision of an ecotechnic future is thus worth keeping in mind. As a plan for the near term, though, it faces extreme challenges of the sort suggested by my previous post on the succession process. In the language of ecological succession, a fully ecotechnic society is a climax community, and you can’t make the jump from pioneer weeds to climax forest in a single transition. The conditions that allow the climax forest to establish and maintain itself in the face of competition from other biotic communities haven’t been achieved yet.<br><br>This is as true in human affairs as in the development of any other biotic community. It’s as pleasant as it is popular to think that human social change is driven primarily by deliberate choice or by some other uniquely human factor, but the science of human ecology and the evidence of history – and history is simply human ecology mapped onto the dimension of time – both suggest otherwise. Industrial civilization triumphed over other forms of human society not because people agreed to make that happen, but because at the time of its emergence, in a world with untapped fossil fuel reserves, it was able to overcome the competitive pressure of other human social systems and the challenges of nature. <br><br>Industrial civilization faces collapse, in turn, because when fossil fuels are scarce and expensive, and the biosphere is undergoing drastic changes, its ability to maintain itself against the challenges of nature and competition from other, less energy- and technology-dependent human social systems is doubtful at best. The forms of human society that rise to prominence in the aftermath of industrialism, in turn, will be those that can establish and maintain themselves more effectively than their rivals in the changing world of the deindustrial age. We may have our preferences, but nature has the final say.<br><br>The conditions that would allow an ecotechnic society to establish and maintain itself are more or less those that existed before the industrial revolution broke open the treasure chest of the Earth’s stored carbon and started looting it for short-term advantage. In a world where energy resources are limited to sun, wind, water, muscle, and biomass, and all work must be accomplished by those means, those societies that evolve efficient and sustainable technologies using those resources have major survival advantages over rival societies that use them unsustainably – for a good example, compare imperial China’s 5000-year history with the death spiral that claimed the ancient Maya.<br><br>The problem ecotechnic societies of the near future face is that these conditions do not yet exist. So far, we’ve used up around half the world’s stock of petroleum, and somewhat less than half its stock of coal and natural gas. All these fuels are subject to peaks and declines in production, which means among other things that they will remain available in diminishing amounts for a long time to come. While modern industrial societies as they exist today probably can’t survive the end of constantly increasing energy supplies, the impact of peak fossil fuel production will likely drive the emergence of other forms of industrialism adapted to a world of diminishing fuel supplies – and while those supplies still exist, these neo-industrial societies will probably still be able to wield more economic and military force than ecotechnic rivals.<br><br>More broadly, many of the legacies of today’s industrial societies will continue to exist for decades or centuries into the future. These legacies represent stored energy – the energy needed to create them, and to build the material and knowledge base that made them possible – and the amount of additional energy needed to maintain and use them in many cases will be quite small compared to the stored energy contained in them; the energy needed to keep a hydroelectric plant or a computer in working order is fairly small compared to the energy they embody, or the advantages that owning and using them could confer.<br><br>It’s quite likely that for some decades or centuries, deindustrial societies that would not be able to build a hydroelectric plant or a computer could still maintain the rather less demanding knowledge and resource base needed to keep them functioning, in much the way that Dark Age communities all over Europe used and repaired Roman acqueducts they could never have built themselves. Still, much of the legacy technology inherited by the deindustrial age will not be a renewable resource; when it finally breaks down, it’s gone – for decades, or centuries, or forever.<br><br>The result is an interesting parallel to succession. In the near and middle future, as the deindustrial age unfolds, the societies that will be best able to flourish are precisely those that will be least able to survive over the long term. In the near term, societies that rely on the increasingly efficient use of the remaining fossil fuels, eked out with renewable resources and high technology, will likely do much better than either the wasteful dinosaur cultures of the present industrial period or the lower-energy cultures that will end up replacing them. <br><br>In the middle term, societies that combine sustainable subsistence strategies and economies with an effective use of the industrial age’s legacy technologies will likely do much better than the lingering fossil fuel-dependent societies they replace, or the ecotechnic societies that will replace them in turn. Only when fossil fuel production has dropped to the point that coal and oil are rare geological curiosities, and the remaining legacies of the industrial age no longer play a significant economic role, will ecotechnic societies come into their own.<br><br>It’s crucial to keep this process in mind when planning for the future. One of the great barriers in the way of the lifeboat communities imagined by so many thinkers in the peak oil community these days is that while they’re viable (at least in theory) in the future, they aren’t viable in the present. There just aren’t that many people who are in a position to chuck their industrial lifestyles, move to a rural ecovillage, and successfully support themselves there for decades while the machinery of industrial society slowly creaks and shudders to a halt around them. <br><br>In terms of the model I’ve presented here, the would-be builders of lifeboat communities are like seedlings of some climax forest species trying to grow in a piece of land still covered with pioneer weeds. The conditions that would allow them to flourish haven’t arrived yet. The last years of industrial society, and the decades of neo-industrial societies struggling to manage on declining energy reserves in an age of limits, thus form a hurdle that has to be leapt in order to build something relevant for the future. <br><br>That hurdle can be faced successfully, but it requires a different approach. Instead of trying to make the leap to an ecologically balanced, fully sustainable society all at once, it may turn out to be necessary to climb down the ladder a step at a time, adapting to changes as they happen, and trying to anticipate each step in succession in time to prepare for it, while working out the subsistence strategies and social networks of the future on a variety of smaller scales. <br><br>This approach is evolutionary rather than revolutionary – that is, it relies on incremental changes and a continuous process of experimentation rather than trying to break from the past and impose an ideal that may turn out to be no more viable that what it replaces. Among other things, this means that it can be carried out on local and even individual scales, a detail that makes it much more viable in practical terms than attempts to change society as a whole from the top down. How this process might unfold will be the subject of several future posts.

I take your point about the value of preempting change and 'coming down the ladder' one step at a time, but I would think that simply adapting to circumstances as they change, and keeping one's head above water would be a major achievement in itself... Can I ask you what sort of personal preparations you are making for the crises facing us?<br>(Aidan, Dublin, Ireland)<br><br><a href=climbing-down-ladder.html#c3367359895563834928 title="comment permalink">10/10/07, 4:05 PM</a><br><br>

A few years ago my spouse and I moved from a large city to a much smaller town in a relatively isolated agricultural area in Oregon state; we have a thriving organic vegetable and herb garden, and practice a wide range of low-tech crafts and practical skills. <br><br>We get by perfectly well without a car or, for that matter, most of the technological conveniences so many people see as necessities. Our Druid faith connects us to others sharing similar values, locally and on a wider scale. Once we own our own home -- we've been waiting out the housing bubble -- a great many of the appropriate tech projects I studied in detail in the 1980s are high on the agenda. There are other things in process, but I think you get the idea. <br><br>It's things like this, not massive revolutionary change but personal evolutions proceeding a step at a time, that I believe will allow many people to stay abreast of the waves of change. Above all else, it's a matter of letting go of the easy assumptions of industrial culture and adopting ways of life and thought that don't assume the easy availability of energy. Dmitri Orlov's accounts of life in Russia after the Soviet collapse are well worth reading here -- some very simple choices got a lot of people through times as harsh as the next wave of contraction in the industrial world is likely to be. <br><br>Robin, I certainly hope so. I wish more people in the peak oil community would set aside the dubious pleasures of apocalyptic prophecy and well-meant plans for social overhaul that I think everybody knows will not be adopted in time to matter, and concentrates a little more on the significant steps individuals can take in their own lives to move along the trajectory to the future. Nick Winter's book <i>Peak Oil Prep</i> is one good resource along these lines; my intention is to make this blog, and my forthcoming book <i>The Long Descent</i>, another.<br><br><a href=climbing-down-ladder.html#c5480856450048206126 title="comment permalink">10/10/07, 11:15 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c7001174810640718484></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/11652655872639394084 rel=nofollow>Sabretache</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Thanks for yet another inspirational post JMG ( I trust my recurring thanks are not becoming tedious {g} ).<br><br>My only real issue is with your apparent easy (trite ?) dismissal of apocalyptic thinking as a serious possibility in shaping the future. Maybe we have a difference about the definition of 'apocalyptic', but you certainly appear to be using it as a pejorative. I consider myself to be fairly up to speed with 'peak energy', population growth and environmental degradation issues. I think I am also a long-in-th-tooth realist about human nature and its capacity for the extremes of both altruism and pure evil. It seems to me that the pressures of these converging constraints, together with flawed human nature hold the very real prospect of something close to an apocalypse (in terms of what Western civilisation has come to define as its birthright anyway) before a saner form of civilisation has any real propect of replacing it. I'm thinking here about the near unimaginable destructive power of modern weaponry together with its control being near exclusively in the hands of an aggressive expansionist controlling Empire (The USA and its allies) and a few 'enemies' that also subscribe to the paradigm of perpetual 'progress/growth etc. Short of the sort of revolution that I cannot presently discern as a possiblity, that empire is likely to use all the means at its disposal to expand and maintain hegemony over the entire planet. It is that simple fact that I regard as potentially apocalyptic.<br><br>As Richard Heiberg pointed out in that excellent video production 'Oil Smoke and Mirrors', serious progressive shortages of oil are unlikely to be presented by governments as being due to geologically inevitable depletion, but rather the fault of this or that 'wicked' (by definition) regime that denies us access to what is rightfully ours. After all war is good for business.<br><br>Your vision and prescription are both admirable, but I fear that humanity will face something very close to apocalyptic change before any consensus on a saner sustainable future for the planet emerges.<br><br>I hope I am wrong.<br><br><a href=climbing-down-ladder.html#c7001174810640718484 title="comment permalink">10/11/07, 3:18 AM</a><br><br>

I enjoy your posts enormously and this one was no exception. <br><br>After going through the obligatory 'slough of despond' associated with discovering peak oil I eventually came to conclusions not unlike yours that useful change was more likely to be evolutionary. I think the desire to head-for-the-gills or to lifeboat communities is quite natural and instinctive in nature but as you have observed, not really suited to where we are at right now.<br><br>One of our local prominent peak oil thinkers here is permaculturalist David Holmgren. He has written interesting articles on "retrofitting the suburbs for sustainability" which describes such an evolutionary approach to energy descent in a typical Australian suburban setting - eg work with what we have and slowly adapt.<br><br><a href=climbing-down-ladder.html#c4594875666574287120 title="comment permalink">10/11/07, 4:52 AM</a><br><br>

I'm certain that as a druid you have a strong connection with the medicinal value of the things that you are growing in that garden of course.<br> <br>When I see techniques such as this one: (NB I can't work out how to leave links in comments properly sorry!) <br> <br>http://www.robertamittman.com/jmt/articles/jmtarthritis.html<br> <br>... it makes me feel that there is a certain amount of 'snatching the time and energy we have left' to be done, because communications are such a vital issue here. At the moment, anybody with a good new technique can tell everyone about it, but it won't always be so.<br> <br>Every person working with these methodologies in a research mode can be making the the next 1,000 years alot easier, not just the present day.<br> <br>I'd encourage anyone involved in health to 'think peak', that is, do the research, but work out how each methodology can be used worldwide perpetually when someone is trained in it and has to practice it on the ground without the kind of support systems we have now. Then the health technology becomes sustainable. At the moment it not only is not sustainable, it is not awfully healthy either IMHO!<br> <br>The issue is that as energy goes down research will become harder. I do hope that resources will continue to be available for study of these methods if they can be shown to promise what I might call 'medical sustainability', that is, effective treatment that works past the date when the giant chemical factories that currently provide the raw materials for healing have shut down.<br><br>We do have advantages over those civilizations that have previously experienced declines of this kind, and this is one of them if we can get our butts in gear for it.

I think the forest analogy is apt, but I'm sure you could also wring some profitable metaphors from species adaptation (and perhaps you have, I forget). It is not, after all, the big, energy hungry creatures -- i.e. those able to take more of what they want and hunt and graze more effectively -- who survive change. Especially in instances of rapid change, it is often the ones who need less or least that get by, or those who have made adaptations to their locality and circumstance. And that adaptation quite often begins with an individual animal.<br><br><a href=climbing-down-ladder.html#c7374970639914880964 title="comment permalink">10/11/07, 9:32 AM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c5818337110398009861></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/04737693388485635100 rel=nofollow>John Michael Greer</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Sabretache, we do indeed have a difference of definition around the word "apocalyptic." I'm using it in its technical sense, as a term for the sort of belief system in which history comes to a full stop, as in the apocalyptic dimension of Christian faith. As I've pointed out elsewhere in this blog, apocalyptic ideas from religious sources have had their serial numbers filed off by a wide range of secular ideologies over the last few centuries; mind you, they're still essentially faith-based, and fill the same emotional needs. <br><br>A lot of people these days have come to use the word "apocalyptic" to mean simply "very, very bad." If that's the definition you're using, I won't argue your point. While my take on the future envisions a lot of localized disasters rather than one big one, that doesn't mean it's going to be an easy ride. I expect to see cities, regions, and some nations fall off the map. There will be plenty of hunger, disease, impoverishment, warfare, and violence; in the final years of a civilization, these are givens. The important point, though, is that there are also possibilities for constructive change. <br><br>Scm, to my way of thinking Holmgren has the right idea, or one of the right ideas. As Ernest Thompson Seton used to say, it's a matter of where you are, with what you have, right now. <br><br>Nnonth, expect to see much more on this in future posts. One of the advantages of alternative medicine is that nearly every form of it uses fewer resources and less energy than conventional western medicine. <br><br>Anthony, two decades ago Lovelock was insisting that life on Earth would be extinct in a few thousand years because Gaia's capacity to buffer temperature changes was almost used up. Turned out the biosphere had several additional temperature-regulating cycles he hadn't noticed. He's always had a penchant for extreme theories, and the claim you cite is one of them. Look up the geological data and you'll find that at many points in Earth's history, CO2 levels and global temperatures have been much higher than they are today, without making most of the planet uninhabitable. <br><br>Does that mean we have nothing to worry about? Of course not. A few centuries from now, if things go very badly wrong, the Earth's land surface could be half the size it is today due to a 300' rise in sea level, and most of the planet could be transitioning to tropical and subtropical jungle, the way it was in the Mesozoic. That's going to involve drastic changes, and those on top of the other dimensions of the crisis of industrial society won't leave much left of today's civilization. This is why incremental change needs to start now, while there's time (as Nnonth points out) to draw on today's knowledge base.<br><br><a href=climbing-down-ladder.html#c5818337110398009861 title="comment permalink">10/11/07, 9:35 AM</a><br><br>

(Order-of-magnitude-faster processes than the IPCC has anticipated, breaking news from the arctic icepack, and accelerated rates of carbon and methane release the past couple of years.) <br><br>Your view is more in line with the consensus IPCC reports, and of course is well supported by the evidence you cite. I'm not so sanguine, and tend to agree with what I read as Anthony's point that the 'Lovelock Death Spiral' scenario is technically possible, and might play out, given just enough bad luck. <br><br>However... somewhat counterintuitively, just because the scenario is possible does not make it worth planning for. Since the very-worst-case, (already past the tipping point and headed to Venus) climate scenario is not really actionable, spending time arguing back and forth about it is sort of like dinosaurs writing position papers on the KT meteor impact. A pastime, not a response, since within the scenario no response is realistically possible.<br><br>I find it much better to focus on the moderate-to-grim scenarios that also have good supporting evidence, and that ARE actionable. And in this zone where the likely meets the doable, I always find your posts to be very valuable resources.<br><br><a href=climbing-down-ladder.html#c1734562819153076949 title="comment permalink">10/11/07, 1:12 PM</a><br><br>

I have a rough idea of the future. It is dark, tough and uncertain. Those who will survive must have a strong purpose. Amost everybody will see uncountably many people die or refugees walking aimlessly along roads if not one of them, like the ones I saw this morning (third world refugees trying to cross the channel to England). Believe me, when you approach them, you realize they do not tell us everything about the world on TV. They do not tell us about the ultimate poverty and destitution that's in there.<br><br>Tomorrow they will be in the millions. <br><br>Sometimes, I drive (sorry!) to Wissant on the coast, from where you can have a superb view of the so-called "straight of Dover" and of England. That's where "only" 20 miles to swim or sail separates the European continent from the UK.<br>The floodbarriers of Wissant have been recently heavily damaged by the gigantic erosion that global warming and see level changes put into motion.<br><br>One day, refugees might be crowding up there, escaping the infernal heat of southern Europe and hoping to get to England. <br><br>Even with an organic garden and a well equipped little house, it is hard to believe that somebody can make it all-along on his own or within a small isolated community. He would be too vulnerable to large scale migrations.<br><br>Maybe possible in mountains? Or places where it is hard to get?<br><br>I still believe that, independently of the particular view that one holds about the future, to stay in a small or medium size city where there are potential sources of renewable energy and plenty of water, while trying to get local people on-board is a workable option in the near term. It is reminiscent of what Kurt Cobb has discussed in many posts. It builds up confidence.

She traveled a long way to get here..... She's now 87 years old and wise beyond her years.<br><br>After discussing economics and other family members financial matters, it soon became apparent to her, that my view, was that times are never going to, "get better". That the situation is very likely to only worsen, over time...<br><br>Please bear with me, as this message, is for everyone reading this post...<br><br>I shown my Mother, the Paul Chefurka site. This can be found at, http:/www.paulchefurka.ca/Population.html.<br>Quickly scrolling down to the excess deaths chart, and explaining this to her, she turned to me, and told me that she'll have some "business" to attend to. Then, "What shall I do?".... My answer to her, was the hardest one I've ever made. My answer was, "You must die before this date"...pointing on the screen a <br>specific year.... I love, my Mother as much as any son could love their mother!<br><br>Really, the only thing I'm an expert on, is telling people they're going to die.... Sad as it may be...<br><br>To put this into prospective, readers, must know of my education... For years I've, pissed and moaned, about this, why me? Why did I learn so throughly theories of resource depletion? Why so young? Gee, I was in Junior High, when it started for Christ's sake! My education was chosen for me... For years, I wondered, how could this be revelant? How could I possibably make a difference? I dared not, to ever mention this to my folks or anyone! This was and is today, a boarderline of anyone's wildest imagination. So, when my own Mother recalled, "Yes, this, (my education) really upset you, at the time"..I do take that with a little more than a grain of salt. Perhaps, today, I've matured enough to finally appreciate, what I have learned....<br><br>Since, I got this little lap-top, I've been searching the world over, for someone, anyone who has a similiar education as I have.

There seems to be an argument popular here about an apocalyptic time. To be honest I'd have to say that it can be mathematically proven and I'm currently writing a book about it. Having said that there's no point in getting in to the details here because I've been doing all too much of that the last few years.<br><br>What I would like to get in to is that out of chaos comes order. Or is it the other way around? - Well in our case it will be the former. The world as we know it will become an amazing place for humans to live; well the ones that survive anyway. The truth is that although a lot of you seem to think the use of technology will eventually taper off, I think that it's another thing that can be proven mathematically. I'm not talking in an abstract sense here either, because the variables involved in the calculations allows for open system fundamentals (I know that's a catch-22 in and of itself but more will come later).<br><br>Basically what I'd like to drive across is that there is hope to a bright future no matter how everything seems today. For those of us that care we can do a lot with our knowledge. A revolution will inevitably be upon us regardless of what anyone does at this point due to the lack of distractions available to the current 'controllers.' That is a simple one sentence summary, but of course it is far more complex than this.<br>There are a lot of things in this world that are open for debate. A lot of them though, unfrortunately, have more to do with when then what. Certain things due to actions that have been set in motion and have too much momentum to stop on their own, will create a temporary world that is completely erratic. I actually use to believe that people in power knew what they were doing. Now I actually am starting to see that 'sin' is actually blinders for humanity. Whoever wrote about sins originally knew about human nature far more in depth than the majority of us know today; of this I'm sure. They may not have known the scientific explanations, but they understood the effects and knew how to account for them. That's all one needs in order to write a doomsday book. Hey - Isn't that the bible?<br><br><a href=climbing-down-ladder.html#c2559843817678202021 title="comment permalink">10/14/07, 9:50 PM</a><br><br>

I hadn't encountered the term before, but it's an obvious coinage. <br><br>Weaseldog, as America slides down the slope of deindustrialization, it's more likely that population will shift the other way, toward big urban areas with jobs. Look at the sprawling cities of today's third world countries for a preview of our future. <br><br>Seingalt, I'm using "competition" in the Darwinian sense of the word here. If two species try to occupy the same ecological niche, one of them is going to lose out one way or another. In the same way, industrial society elbowed a number of other social "species" out of the way in its rise to dominance, and other "species" of society will replace it once the environmental conditions that made its dominance possible go away. That's all I'm implying by the word. <br><br>Jmullee, all good advice.<br><br>Yooper, I know a number of elderly people whose working plan is to die before things get really bad. I think more people are aware of the situation than are willing to admit to the fact. <br><br>Joel, no, I hadn't. My own guess is that the next economy will evolve rather than being designed, but we'll see. <br><br>Revolution, plenty of people claim that they can calculate the future precisely in advance. I find this improbable, since the mathematics always rest on some set of assumptions that are assumed rather than proven: garbage in, garbage out. This is why I talk in terms of the most probable future, rather than claiming certainty. <br><br>As for the Bible, well, for those of us outside the Abrahamic faiths it doesn't make a lot of sense to insist that a collection of folk tales from a minor Middle Eastern kingdom 3000 years ago, combined with some of the internal documents of a new religious movement from the early Roman Empire, are any more relevant than any other collection of folk tales or accounts of personal religious experiences.

Expressed like that, the difference seems obvious, but in reality, we are always victim of confusions.<br><br>Two examples:<br><br>1) Mathematically proven? Well mathematics is only a "finger".JMG you are right.<br><br>2) The Bible? Again, it is only a finger. It must be understood and criticized on this basis only. Unfortunately, neither "revolution" or you seem to realize it. Or, this is maybe what you mean, JMG, when you say: "if it makes sense to you, use it".<br><br>More generally, we all have a "chart" of the future. But the chart is not the territory. This is a lesson for everybody, because at this stage I think no one has a full picture. That's why we debate on this forum section.<br><br>As for "sin", I believe it points indeed to a fundamental problem for mankind. <br><br>"Sin" is "separation", a concept that, JMG,you should be familiar with.<br><br>As you know, the word "religion" comes from the latin words religare or religere (no one knows exactly), but both terms indicates the idea of "link" with the cosmos or between individuals.<br><br>Our current belief system leads to chaos and mayhem. It could bring us back to a "re-connection" and a "new order" for the survivors.<br><br>That's currently my main source of hope for the future. JMG, you called it "super-natural", I believe it corresponds to one of the most fundamental laws of the Universe (that "aliens" must know if they do exist). It has to do with the evacuation of entropy. I don' t believe in "magic". But I do believe in "connection", through the "Spirit", to use a word easy to understand, which helps us to act and to think in a way that is good for us and our surroundings.(It would explain why "aliens" are almost invisible, because direct interference into our society would destroy it right away).<br><br>It has to do with personnal responsability.<br><br>So, again, JMG, it seems that we previously argued about fingers, and not about the "Moon", when you opposed a sense of "responsability" and a sense of "supernatural".<br><br>It is not a kind of "Harry Potter" thing!<br><br><a href=climbing-down-ladder.html#c7235461487313354286 title="comment permalink">10/16/07, 1:34 AM</a><br><br>

All that really differs is the scale at which we have repeated their mistake. We have repeated their experiment, on the scale of a planet.<br><br>Technology is simply the use of tools through the consumption of energy. There is no technology that does not advance entropy when used. Energy is our primary constraint. As our energy availability declines, groups will work and fight to accumulate it to maintain the highest lifestyle they can and to support their offspring. They will have to deny others the use of available energy.<br><br>Look at the infighting now over the wars and S-CHIP. Bush's power base will let nothing stand in their way of concentrating energy and power to direct for their own uses. And they are no using it to invest in the future. If they lose a grip on this, still another group will wage war to capture the remaining energy supplies. War will continue where the last oilfields are until no one can pump it.<br><br>The rest of us will be stripped of wealth, taxed, put to work and abandoned when we can't be used anymore. We will not be allowed to make significant plans for a peaceable downturn as the resources needed can be used by others to capture more resources.<br><br>We are in the post climax phase and the carrion feeders are becoming the ruling class. This will not change until all of the fossil fuels are depleted, or made unavailable through war.<br><br>Generations in the distant future will use technology as it won't die. But it will revert back to the simplest forms. It will consist of things that can be made by human hands and the power of water and charcoal. Some electronics will survive, but I doubt it will be made of integrated circuits and computer chips. It is more likely to be cat whiskers and hand made transistors.<br><br>This doesn't mean that we should try. A low energy lifestyle will make a person less of a target. It will improve one's odds as things make a turn for the worse.<br><br>And so what if we are seeing the cusp of man's technological achievements? This is our place on the Great Mandela.
