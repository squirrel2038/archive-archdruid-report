I’d meant this week’s <span style="font-style: italic">Archdruid Report </span>to go sailing straight ahead along the course charted out two weeks ago, with a discussion of the role that population contraction is likely to play as the industrial age winds down into the deindustrial future. Still, just as the guys on the <span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span> got used to Jason or Hercules or somebody pointing off to starboard and saying, “Hey, that island looks worth checking out,” those of my readers who have followed this particular voyage in search of the future have probably learned to expect sudden swerves into unexpected territory.<br><br>This particular swerve was inspired in part by the last paragraph of a blogpost by Sharon Astyk, whose writings on the crisis of the industrial world are among the best out there. The post, <a href=http://www.energybulletin.net/30518.html>“Depletion, racism, and paving the road to hell,”</a> focuses on a side of peak oil very few people like to talk about – the pervasive themes of race and class that run through so many of its current narratives, offering starring roles in dramas of survival only to middle-class whites, while relegating the poor and nonwhite to walk-on roles as victims in mass graves or members of the ubiquitous rampaging mobs of survivalist fantasy. While I have my disagreements with some of her stances, it’s a good post, and it points out issues that have to be addressed if the ideas discussed in this forum are ever to be more than the mental games of a privileged class with no better use for its time.<br><br>But then there’s the last paragraph, and the passage that brought me to a dead stop: “[T]he one bright spot in this future is that peak oil and climate change represent the greatest hope for reallocation of wealth and justice in the world.”<br><br>That’s an astonishing statement, and the fact that similar statements can be heard all over the peak oil community is one of the more astonishing things about it.<br><br>After all, Astyk is not exactly the only person who thinks that the crisis of industrial society is “the greatest hope” for social change. She may not be pleased to hear that the same hope guides Nick Griffin, current head of the British National Party. The BNP, for those who don’t keep tabs on the far end of British politics, is an extremist party of the far right that advocates, among other things, “repatriating” nonwhite people from Britain to their (or their great-great-great-grandparents’) country of origin. It would be hard to find a wider political gap in today’s world than the one between Griffin and Astyk, and yet both think that peak oil is on their side.<br><br>They’re not alone in that belief, either. Find a political or social movement far from the mainstream these days and odds are you’ll find it proclaiming that peak oil will put the future they desire into their waiting hands. Marxists waiting for proletarian revolution, Klansmen waiting for the South to rise again, neoprimitivists waiting for civilization to go away so they can lead the hunting and gathering lifestyle of their dreams, all pin their hopes for the future on peak oil. If there are still Distributivists out there – I hope there are; Distributivism always seemed more humane to me than a good many of the notions that elbowed it aside in the political free-for-all of the 1930s – I would not be surprised in the least to hear them claim that peak oil will inevitably bring Chesterton’s dream to pass. Not since Doctor Fox’s Genuine Arkansas Snake Oil stopped being sold on the carnival circuit, I suspect, has one remedy been applied to so many different diagnoses.<br><br>This invites satire, but there are patterns at work that deserve close and serious attention instead. Most of the grand mythic narratives that compete for attention in today’s collective imagination claim that history has a direction and a goal. Some, like the mythology of progress I’ve tried to anatomize before, take some set of current trends and project them out indefinitely in the direction of Utopia. Others take some set of current trends, define their necessary endpoint as hell on earth, and use that identification to rally opposition against them. Yet there’s at least one more class of narrative, one that sees the goal of history as something hidden in the undergrowth of events, known only to the few just now, but destined for sudden revelation.<br><br>Most of the narratives of this third class derive in one way or another from a single source – the unique historical experience of the Jewish people. Like the other minor kingdoms of the ancient Near East, the Jews saw themselves as sharers in a covenant with a tribal god, who gave them his protection in exchange for their faith and offerings. Like their neighbors, they struggled to square that faith with the brutal realities of the international politics of their time. After a brief heyday under David and Solomon, the history of ancient Israel was a story of decline ending in the catastrophe of deportation to Babylon.<br><br>The conquest of Babylon less than a century later by the Persian Empire, though, sent the story spinning in a new direction. Under Persian rule the Jews were permitted to return home, restore a national community and rebuild their temple. This astonishing redemption at a time when all reasonable hope had faded had a profound impact on Jewish religion and culture, and became the template against which Jewish history before and afte found a measure. To Jewish theologians then and ever since, the restoration of the Temple showed that the god of Israel had not failed his people even when all the facts seemed to point the other way. The tenacious faith this conviction bred played a crucial role in allowing the Jews to survive the much greater catastrophes that lay in wait as history unfolded.<br><br>Yet the same faith found other believers as core ideas of Judaism got taken up and reworked by the younger religions of Christianity and Islam, and spread in these new forms across the face of the planet. The same vision of a divine plan within contemporary adversities that would be made plain in some future act of redemption became common currency for human hopes across the world. When medieval Welsh rebels invoked the dream of King Arthur come back from Avalon to drive the English invader back into the sea, or 17th century Chinese secret societies claimed that the Mandate of Heaven still rested with the hidden heirs of the Ming dynasty, those claims echoed with the same hope of national redemption that kept their Jewish contemporaries going through their own bitter troubles.<br><br>Later still, as religion gave way to less overtly mythic ideologies in the collective imagination of much of humankind, the same story spun out into a galaxy of versions backing any political or social movement you care to name. Very few narratives can undergo that sort of diffusion without being debased into a cliché, or even a mental automatism, and the idea that history must be on the side of whatever ideology one happens to support has become so common these days that it approximates the latter. <br><br>A more specific problem, though, is that if peak oil is on anyone’s side, it’s not likely to be that of the liberal causes for which Astyk hopes to recruit it. Most of the great achievements of the liberal tradition have taken place in times of economic expansion – consider the abolition of the slave trade in the prosperous early Victorian era, for example, or the civil rights movement in America in the boomtime 1950s. Times of economic contraction, by contrast, tend to foster reactionary politics – consider the spread of totalitarian regimes across Europe in the decade that followed the stock market crash of 1929. Those tendencies are no more absolute than anything else in history, but they do exist.<br><br>The causes driving this pattern are doubtless complex, but one core factor can be teased out of Astyk’s own analysis. When the economic pie is growing larger, nobody has to lose part of their share in order for those unfairly deprived to get more. When the pie is static, though, a gain for anyone is a loss for somebody else, and when the pie is actually shrinking, the division of slices can all too easily degenerate into a mad scramble for scraps and crumbs. Abstract concepts of equity become hard to keep in sight when it’s your own children who risk going hungry. For many middle class people who had been secure from want, the Great Depression brought this experience, and reactionary regimes that promised them security prospered accordingly.<br><br>I don’t think it’s necessary to be a “doomer,” whatever exactly that label means, to think that as the industrial world begins sliding down the far side of Hubbert’s peak, the pie of today’s industrial economy will shrink a great deal, and a lot of people who are comfortable today will find themselves in the same situation their grandparents faced in the years after 1929. I also don’t think it’s necessary to be a “doomer” to notice that while most parties on the left are avoiding the implications of peak oil the way a ten-year-old boy tries to wriggle away from an elderly aunt’s kiss, the BNP and other parties of the far right are already hard at work <a href=http://www.bnp.org.uk/peakoil/index.htm>positioning themselves</a> to take advantage of post-peak realities.<br><br>Thus if Astyk means simply that liberals might be able to respond to the social impacts of peak oil and climate change, and in the process regain some of the ground they’ve lost in recent decades, she may be right. They’ll have to work overtime, both to counter the advantages held by reactionaries and to make up for time already lost, but the thing has been done successfully before – the New Deal comes to mind. On the other hand, if she’s claiming that the wrenching social problems set in motion by these two factors will necessarily favor her agenda, she’s likely misleading herself, and she may be doing the causes she supports a significant disservice.<br><br>More generally, it may be worth suggesting that those who claim that peak oil is a door to their favorite Utopia are engaged in the same unproductive act. As the age of cheap abundant energy comes to an end, things will change; more likely than not they will change drastically, and for most people, many of those changes will be for the worse. I’ve argued here and elsewhere that the scope of those changes can best be understood by comparing them to the decline and fall of civilizations in the past. One lesson that can be learned from the past, though, is that waiting for catastrophe to accomplish your goals for you is one of history’s classic losing bets.<br><br>If anything but a slow decline into confusion and forgetfulness is to take form within the shell of today’s industrial civilization, it will have to be built brick by brick and board by board, and its resemblance to Utopia will be tempered by the sharp realities of resource limits and a biosphere in disarray. History chooses her own course, and those who insist that history is necessarily on their side are likely to find out the hard way that if she helps anyone at all – which she does not always do – it is most often those who help themselves.

Here in UK, I like many people have been keeping an eye on the BNP for some time. Their creepy presence at peak oil events has been noted for a couple of years. In terms of political influence, they have also in the last 2-3 years been trying to gain the support of "suited" types rather than the brainless skinhead thugs who used to be their main base back in the 1980's. Even so, the places where they still get most votes are in the poor areas of decayed northern towns where there are significant communities of racial minorities who can be blamed for the poverty of poor whites. Exactly the segment of population destined to increase in an economically depressed, post-peak era. Of course, many readers will be aware that Britain does not have a spotless record in terms of racism in times of economic trouble - e.g. Oswald Moseley's "Brownshirts" in the 1930's.<br><br>Also, a point arising from last week's article. It seemed to me that Rebecca and some other writers were asking about dates, ages, etc., were tip-toeing around the issue - maybe they did not dare to ask directly - of what time schedule of decline or collapse you expect to see between now and mid-century. Perhaps you will reveal a little more in later episodes!<br><br><a href=is-history-on-anyones-side.html#c6571049404866006725 title="comment permalink">6/6/07, 2:41 AM</a><br><br>

You did a great job of highlighting several implications that I missed, though.<br><br>If there's anything in common among various political communities of all stripes, it's that stubborn belief in some manifest destiny, a future time when everyone will come to see that "we were right all along" — and more, that when destiny arrives, it will bring its benefits to the "right" people (rarely is the fate of "wrong" people spelled out, but I presume it involves a spike in the population of buzzards, crows, possums, coyotes, and other scavengers). The Christian eschaton is rare for being so explicit: the saved get taken to Heaven, and everyone else dies a horrible death and they burn in Hell forever. The earth, meanwhile, "passes away" and is rebuilt anew. (This is where I part company with my imminent-end times brethren: they use "it'll all be gone by next year" as an excuse to ignore the commandment to be good stewards of the world.)<br><br>It's funny in a way that you see this same belief among groups who are otherwise diametrically opposed in their other beliefs. In another way, it's sad: at least one group is deluded, and very likely both (or all).<br><br><a href=is-history-on-anyones-side.html#c5251851594174622495 title="comment permalink">6/6/07, 6:45 AM</a><br><br>

Some new variety emerges, and it's just a small minority until some selective pressure comes along; the new variety has some unique adaptation that makes it better suited to handling the selective pressure, so it survives, while all the other varieties, don't. Isn't this the same mythic narrative? Do you suppose that we're projecting an apocalyptic framework onto natural selection, or might natural selection be one reason that the apocalyptic framework has proven so popular? And, might that suggest that the apocalyptic framework might actually be a useful one, after all?<br><br><a href=is-history-on-anyones-side.html#c6845028599312328943 title="comment permalink">6/6/07, 7:48 AM</a><br><br>

And also, that redemption is powerful at an individual level, and in a community, but that it dilutes pretty quickly when applied to larger projects.<br><br>The one thing I'm pretty confident will change is the scale of things. The enormity of our political, mercantile, cultural and even religious institutions, and the complete absense of accountability, responsibility or stewardship that it engenders, is made possible by abundant cheap energy. I think we can rely on a lot of that to evaporate, as you've indicated in your analysis of catabolic collapse. While I agree that Sharon's confidence in a future of shared wealth is probably misplaced, I do think vulnerability is likely to be a lot better distributed, and that wealth, pedigree, and station may not provide the sort of blanket immunities from pestilence, violence and environmental hazard that they do at present.<br><br><a href=is-history-on-anyones-side.html#c5287333194841254029 title="comment permalink">6/6/07, 9:11 AM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c3677648842558659866></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/08724938709642010624 rel=nofollow>Loveandlight</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt><a href=http://www.ranprieur.com/ rel=nofollow>Ran Prieur</a> in one of his essays said something to the effect that liberals always lose to fascists because fascists understand better than anybody else what civilization is really all about.<br><br>As far as primitivism is concerned, one should keep in mind that before the Holocene and agriculture, we existed for many tens of thousands of years as hunter-gatherers, and this existence was likely an outgrowth of the way our early hominid successors lived. Though to be sure, when we became <i>Homo sapiens,</i> our tool-making and -using as well as plant cultivation behaviors became more varied and complex. Compare this to the past ten thousand years in which we created something that demands so much in the way of resource inputs that it has, for at least the last six thousand years, been prone to rather dangerous instability. This dramatic change has also been characterized by a no-holds-barred assault on Mother Earth.<br><br>To me, this suggests that the primitive life is our natural state resulting from evolution, which as Daniel Quinn was fond of pointing out, is awfully hard to improve upon. There may be many wrenching convulsions in both human life and in nature that will frustrate the efforts of many aspiring primitivists to revert to the old ways; but as long as they are the sort of primitivists who are actively cultivating the skills and mentality-changes necessary for "re-wilding", theirs seems to me the best bet for helping themselves bring their vision of the future to fruition. <br><br>Climate change will probably be the major factor that will forestall any attempts to continue civilization as it has existed for the past ten millenia. I don't see how large-scale agriculture supporting major cities can happen in climate conditions significantly hotter or colder and less stable than those of the Holocene.<br><br><a href=is-history-on-anyones-side.html#c3677648842558659866 title="comment permalink">6/6/07, 10:18 AM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c2358492794031041159></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/17547121621115074866 rel=nofollow>jewishfarmer</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>I enjoyed this piece, and the useful critique (along with the kind words) a great deal - thanks for taking me seriously.<br><br>I must admit that I actually have much more in common with the BNP than you've imagined - we're not such diametrical opposites as all that. I actually support the involuntary repatriation of everyone of European origin back to their respective European countries, which would simultaneously compensate Native Americans and African Americans from their land and overthrow the current administration. It would probably break a few eggs, but what the heck. I am, of course, entirely joking.<br><br>I would quibble a bit with your choices of historical examples for your claim that social change mostly happens during good economic times - the great thing about having the whole scope of human history is that it is easy for you or me to cherry pick examples. But I would tend to suggest that American history actually suggests the opposite - for example, the abolition of the American slave trade occurred during the turbulent post-revolutionary years, the great rise of socialism, labor and other liberal movements in the US occurred during the great depression, and the civil war and the abolition of slavery followed the economic and social crises of the 1850s. Both the civil rights movement and the women's movement in the US to a large degree derived from the period of social disruption that was WWII - women and african americans had the experience of living as equals and were discontented with the experience of having equality abruptly removed. IMHO, the gestation of historical change can often be found in periods of crisis - for good and ill.<br><br>I might try and make a similar case for Europe as well, but it would be an example of cherry picking - I could poke at the great and glorious revolution and its times, but you could come up with counter examples.<br><br>Ultimately, I really do have a great deal in common with the BNP, in that I tend to be extremely practical (read Machiavellian ;-) about political change, and I believe that in unfamiliar times, people who seem to know what they are doing are more likely to be elected than people who don't. I think that could be a far right party, a left party or somewhere in the middle - what matters is wise planning and anticipatory thinking - having a plan, control of iconography and being ready is what, ultimately, will decide who takes power. I'd rather (obviously) it be people like me than people like the BNP. I'm really not sure ideology has that much to do with it - I think the world is full of people who bend with the wind, and whose politics are shaped by a desire for reassurance and security. <br><br>So I do in fact believe that peak oil represents an opportunity for political and ideological change. I don't think it is likely to lead to any *particular* outcome, without considerable work on the part of the group that wishes to lead. <br><br>Cheers, and thanks again for the thought-provoking article,<br><br>Sharon<br><br><a href=is-history-on-anyones-side.html#c2358492794031041159 title="comment permalink">6/6/07, 11:57 AM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c6388488886447560627></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/04737693388485635100 rel=nofollow>John Michael Greer</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Maura, glad to hear that people on your side of the pond are watching the BNP; they've become very slick of late. As for the timing of decline, that's a very good question with no easy answer. It'll proceed at different paces in different regions; for the people of New Orleans and small Kansas towns, the end of industrial civilization is well under way already, while for some of the rest of us it may take decades longer. <br><br>Farfetched, exactly - it's the same tune with an endless number of verses, and it ends with the same awkward thud each time. <br><br>Jason, very good. You're seeing the narrative as narrative, and reading it through another popular cultural narrative, the Horatio Alger Little-Engine-That-Could story that Darwin imported into biology. <br><br>The problem with your wider argument, though, is that you're confusing cultural utility with predictive accuracy. Apocalyptic myth is an effective way for a small, socially marginal group, especially one that resents the larger community around it, to strengthen its members' faith in its ideology; thus it was probably inevitable that neoprimitivism would adopt it. Still, how many of the following events have actually taken place? <br><br>- the arrival of Messiah <br>- the reappearance of the 12th Imam<br>- the appearance of the Saoshyant<br>- the return of John Frum<br>- the return of the ancestors and the buffalo<br>- the restoration of the Ming Dynasty<br>- the return of King Arthur<br>- the descent of the Space Brothers<br><br>I could go on for pages, of course. Clearly, the fact that apocalyptic beliefs are useful does not make them true. Quite the contrary, as the above list suggests, the more fervently a group affirms that an imminent catastrophe is about to give them the world they want, the more certain one can be that nothing of the sort is likely to happen. <br><br>Lizm, your comment on the distribution of vulnerability seems square on target to me. One very likely consequence of peak oil is that today's privileged classes are likely to be a good deal more vulnerable than the poor. Those who have grown up dealing with adversity are a lot more likely to be able to weather tough times than those who have no experience with it. <br><br>Loveandlight, you could as well use the same evolutionary narrative to claim that agriculture is an evolutionary advance on hunting and gathering, therefore more likely to succeed. As for the climate issue, agriculture evolved during the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary, during some of the most drastic climate fluctuations the earth has seen in the last few million years, and during much of the Holocene temperatures were much higher than they are today, so agriculture is hardly going to be surplused by another round of climate change. <br><br>Even extreme global warming estimates would leave most of what's now the temperate world very suitable for tropical-style wetland rice farming, sweet potato culture, and many other warm-climate crops. Meanwhile, northern Siberia, Canada, and postglacial Antarctica will have temperatures and rain patterns equivalent to today's major grain-growing areas.<br><br>More generally, though, apocalyptic myth is apocalyptic myth, whatever set of claims are used to dress it up. If you pin your hopes on catastrophe to give you the world you want, be aware that people have been doing that for a long time, and the results have not been good.<br><br><a href=is-history-on-anyones-side.html#c6388488886447560627 title="comment permalink">6/6/07, 12:07 PM</a><br><br>

I'm glad to hear you're thinking in terms of organized political action, as that might be able to accomplish much -- if it gets started soon, and finds a vision of the future that will appeal to a wide enough spectrum of society. <br><br>Locke, while it's very occasionally happened that a civilization declined and was replaced by hunting and gathering, it's vastly more common for a civilization to decline and be replaced, first by less organized farmers, and then by another civilization. We're not exempt from that fate, either - and insisting that the catastrophe of your choice is going to give you the future you want is still a recipe for failure, however you dress it up.<br><br><a href=is-history-on-anyones-side.html#c883948180496421224 title="comment permalink">6/6/07, 12:47 PM</a><br><br>

I'm not an eloquent or particularly erudite writer myself, but have been doing my small bit to raise awareness among my friends, through conversations, and posts on my journal, trying to encourage community-building, etc. <br><br>For our own part, we've taken on the 90% Reduction challenge -- not that we'll succeed across the board, at least not in the next 2 years anyway. But it gives me a frame of reference for posts that may continue to encourage readers to try some conservation efforts themselves. That work is kind of working towards prolonging the amount of fossil fuels available, and slowing down the climate change. In particular I look to do things that don't cost a lot of money, since pretty much none of my friends are 'rolling in dough'.<br><br>Also continuing to work on acquiring low-tech skills, and hopefully moving to the country, maybe next year. Yes, I know not everyone can (or should) do that, but for us it works. But where we'll be moving is to my husband's parents' town, so we already have a connection there to build on. Massachusetts is kind of crowded and already suffering from recession issues (if not as badly as some places). If/when the economy takes a serious downturn, we'll already be part of our new community -- a small town with a lot of "interesting" people, who enjoy discussing and debating at town meetings, and aren't closed to new ideas if they can be shown to be positive and workable.<br><br>On Sharon's post, I wasn't quite sure how to respond, because I'm half-Chinese... guess I'm a rare bird in the PO and sustainability crowds. Oh well, kind of used to that...<br><br>I agree with others here that preparation and changing ways of doing things in one's life are going to be key to not just survival, but living. It's been a sad thing to discover that some people would literally rather be dead than live in the world I see coming, one where things aren't so easy to come by (one is a good friend of mine). As for me, I don't see this set of challenges as being much different than what I grew up with. Yes, my parents had/have advanced degrees, taught at universities, and I went to college myself. But they came from low-income backgrounds and believed that we should all learn useful skills like gardening, cooking, sewing, and basic carpentry. And perhaps most importantly, to look at what was around us with as open a mind as possible, in order to truly _see_ what was there, not just our wishful thinking. <br><br>btw, I said "low-income" instead of "poor" above, because having grown up on stories from my parents' childhoods, I know their lives were rich in many ways. And today, gradually learning to live on less, I've been finding more and more to appreciate in my changing life, not less.<br><br>Looking forward to reading your future posts!<br><br><a href=is-history-on-anyones-side.html#c9109839449103238202 title="comment permalink">6/6/07, 1:21 PM</a><br><br>

They're trying to get all the neo-Nazis to get together just downstream from where I'm setting up.<br><br><i>Still, how many of the following events have actually taken place? </i><br><br>See, this is precisely where the dismissal of primitivism as apocalyptic goes completely wrong. While I agree that primitivism shares the same narrative, and even wrote an article to that effect long ago, this kind of comparison is not legitimate in the least. The narrative itself is extremely broad if we're stretching it to catch the natural selection ideas of primitivism and the Rapture of the Elect under a single heading, so what really matters is the information being assembled inside that narrative framework. Anthropological, climatological and ecological studies are a far cry from the exegesis of Bronze Age sectarian literature. That they interpreted Bronze Age sectarian literature through a basic framework that's similar in outline to that we see scientific data through does not make the two predictions comparable.<br><br><i>Quite the contrary, as the above list suggests, the more fervently a group affirms that an imminent catastrophe is about to give them the world they want, the more certain one can be that nothing of the sort is likely to happen. </i><br><br>Now that doesn't really follow from the evidence, does it? Even an historical correlation wouldn't provide a causal mechanism for such a thing. If you want to focus on the narratives themselves, that's certainly a worthy pursuit, but it rather precludes any notion of proving one narrative or another "correct," since each one will fit some scenarios, but not others. Knowing more than one story, as you say, is the root of wisdom.<br><br><i>... you could as well use the same evolutionary narrative to claim that agriculture is an evolutionary advance on hunting and gathering, therefore more likely to succeed.</i><br><br>That would be a very difficult argument to make; 10,000 years is a very short time in evolutionary terms. It's really quite remarkable how quickly it has failed. Even the most disastrous evolutionary experiments typically take longer than this.<br><br><i>As for the climate issue, agriculture evolved during the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary, during some of the most drastic climate fluctuations the earth has seen in the last few million years, and during much of the Holocene temperatures were much higher than they are today, so agriculture is hardly going to be surplused by another round of climate change.</i><br><br>This is more than a little bit of an exaggeration, don't you think? It's rather clear that agriculture emerged largely <i>after</i> the transition to the Holocene was finished. Climate change ends not just the Holocene interglacial, but the Pleistocene itself. That's going to be by far the biggest hurdle agriculture's ever faced.<br><br><i>Locke, while it's very occasionally happened that a civilization declined and was replaced by hunting and gathering, it's vastly more common for a civilization to decline and be replaced, first by less organized farmers, and then by another civilization. We're not exempt from that fate, either - and insisting that the catastrophe of your choice is going to give you the future you want is still a recipe for failure, however you dress it up.</i><br><br>Previous civilizations have all been regional and agrarian. New civilizations arose because the Holocene climate persisted and previous civilizations had left behind sufficient resources. Ours is the first global, industrial civilization. What will future civilizations be built of, that we haven't consumed? We've discussed this before, of course, so there's no need to rehash that discussion, except to say that your statement here is misleading--even if you do turn out to be right on this, there is very good reason that you might not, so the certainty you seem to put behind this is certainly unjustified, if nothing else.<br><br><a href=is-history-on-anyones-side.html#c4359062387497765582 title="comment permalink">6/6/07, 2:13 PM</a><br><br>

I found your analysis of that work to be quite insightful and shared it with several others. I also found your description of the Western Revolutionary Tradition to be such a concise definition that I used it in my Political Science class and, in light of this discussion, I think it is worth repeating:<br>In its basic form, that narrative claims that all of humanity stands at a decisive turning point of history, facing the choice between the horrors of an utterly corrupt past and the shining possibilities of a future on the verge of being born. The existing order of society, the primary source of human misery, is beyond redemption and teeters on the edge of collapse, and a new social and political system that will bring out the best that humanity is capable of achieving stands ready to replace it. The existence of an ideal society in the distant past shows that a better world is possible, and that society’s destruction by the first forerunners of the present rulers of the world will soon be avenged. The old order is paving the way for its own demise by bringing about social changes that foster the emergence of its own replacement, while it makes its downfall necessary by pushing the world to the edge of ruin. All that is needed is the spread of the new system’s ideology, followed by one great effort on the part of people of good will, and a Great Turning will take place, ushering in a happy future for all of humanity.<br><br> That is the essence of apocalyptic thinking. Oppressed people, seeking to reconcile why they are not granted what they see as their proper place of prominence in society and widespread acceptance of their world view, predict a future in which their exalted and special status will be revealed and their seemingly powerful enemies will be destroyed. One writer described it as using the past to predict the future to help cope with the present. It isn’t necessarily religious but when ever I see such writings I am always reminded of the Magnificat, the song supposedly sung by Mary when she tells her sister about being pregnant with the future Messiah:<br>He has shown strength with his arm<br>and has scattered the proud in their conceit,<br>Casting down the mighty from their thrones<br>and lifting up the lowly.<br>He has filled the hungry with good things<br>and sent the rich away empty. (Luke 1:46-55). <br><br>Not only was Jesus going to save your soul and usher in a new age, he was going to take care of all your enemies too! It is tempting in both its religious and secular forms, but self deluding as well.<br><br><a href=is-history-on-anyones-side.html#c5229835127175660132 title="comment permalink">6/6/07, 2:19 PM</a><br><br>

This is my first entry, after having read some of JMG’s recent posts and the dialogues that follow them. I'm quite impressed by the general collegiality of the exchanges; it looks like a nice place to visit, learn, and contribute.<br><br>By way of introduction, I’m an old software engineer, who’s become gradually more aware of the coming crises and interested in how we might best meet them. A few years ago, I started a project to guide my learning in this, and in the hopes of engaging others in it. You can see the current status of the project (pretty much untouched for a couple of years) at <a href=http://dondwiggins.net/FinalExam.html rel=nofollow>Humanity’s Final Exam</a>. More recently, I’ve been focusing in on what I consider the essential role of robust, adaptable communities in dealing with the changes; I have a skeletal essay on this <a href=http://dondwiggins.net/EssaysOnCommunity.html rel=nofollow>here</a>. Finally: one of the things that attracted me to JMG’s work is his clear-eyed examinations of the role of spiritualality in adapting to the emerging realities. I’ve written up some notes on my own <a href=http://dondwiggins.net/MySpritualJourney.html rel=nofollow>spiritual journey</a>.<br><br>I welcome feedback on these; I consider them less my personal property than as offerings to a community of learning.<br><br>Commenting on the post at hand: it might be useful to compare the emerging situation with Thomas Kuhn’s model of “normal science” versus “revolutionary science”, first published in his book <i>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i>. Kuhn sees normal science as ruled by a paradigm that structures and guides the work of scientists, provides the foundational assumptions, and delimits what counts as valid research. Also “built in” to normal science, however, is a tolerance for “anomalies”: problems that arise within the paradigm, but which can’t be solved within it. A few anomalies don’t disturb the paradigm, but as they accumulate, the paradigm begins to break down, which may lead to a revolution that causes it to be abandoned. During a revolutionary period, contenders for the next dominant paradigm will arise and be tested; in fact, that characterizes the period. Eventually, a new paradigm is established, and a new normal period ensues, during which the paradigm is enhanced and fleshed out.<br><br>Relevant to the themes of the current post: it seems to me that the new dominant paradigm may not be any of the original contenders; the crisis will not only select, but also encourage adaptations and combinations of contenders.<br><br><a href=is-history-on-anyones-side.html#c6395931742752456786 title="comment permalink">6/6/07, 3:21 PM</a><br><br>

I've had Marxists object to my analysis along the same lines you have - and their objections made me no more likely to believe in their myth than yours have. <br><br>It's all the same narrative, and the specific set of facts used to justify it matters very little, because the narrative governs the selection and meaning of facts. You must have noticed that people who disagree with you consistently refuse to accept the meaning you assign to your long lists of facts. That's not just cussedness; it's because they disagree with the interpretive scheme that comes with your narrative, and so facts that seem conclusive to you (because your narrative defines them so) mean something else to them (because their narrative puts different interpretations on them).<br> <br>This is why it's so crucial to read narratives as narratives, and to notice how often the same narrative produces the same result, no matter what facts are used to fill in the preexisting slots in the structure. That's the point I'm trying to make here. <br><br>Klee, glad to hear the definition was useful! You could probably sum it up, in an unfriendly but not inaccurate way, by saying that apocalyptic myth is an unusually grandiose revenge fantasy. Certainly I've known a lot of believers in imminent apocalypse whose motivation seemed mostly to be the thought of looking down with a sad smile at the bleached bones of the kids who used to tease them in grade school. <br><br>Bill, thank you! Yes, the removal of the Horatio Alger myth from evolutionary biology has been good to see. <br><br>Dwig, thank you for the offerings! And I think you're quite right about the selective effects of crisis on ideology. What comes out the other end of the Long Descent is unlikely to have more than a distant family resemblance to what went into this end of the process.<br><br><a href=is-history-on-anyones-side.html#c5707202452755468756 title="comment permalink">6/6/07, 4:42 PM</a><br><br>

APOKALYPSIS, literally: the lifting of the veil.)<br><br>The Greek root corresponds in the Septuagint to the Hebrew galah (גלה), to reveal. <br><br>...the Apocalypse technically refers to the unveiling of God, and not to the destruction of the world, just of our preconceptions.<br><br>The word apocalypse in Greek means "unveiling"...This term has been downgraded in common usage to refer to the end of the world. But it is more accurate to interpret the term "end of the world", as we see in the King James Version of the Bible, as the "end of the age". The word translated as "world" is actually the Greek word "eon" or "age".<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse<br><br>now, i am neither a scholar of the classic Western languages, nor of the Jewish/Christian Bible, and certainly i am not a philologist, and i do believe that current, common usage supercedes etymology, but i do think it is worth considering, in this context, the original meanings and history of the words we use.<br><br>i am concerned that disagreements over terms may sometimes come between good-intentioned people who are otherwise of a similar mind, and prevent them working together toward more immediate and concrete goals. <br><br>and in this particular case, i think i prefer the above, historical usages of this particular term--End of an Age, and Lifting of a Veil--and i do think that all of the current issues tied to the Peak Oil, climate, and related problematic global trends indeed point to an "Apocalypse" in precisely those original meanings.<br><br>i absolutely agree that it promises nothing certain, beyond inevitable change. and i agree as well, that any person or movement placing all "hope" and no ACTION in whatever Apocalyptic event/trend, is in trouble. but any time that prevailing power structures are sufficiently shaken, is a time that presents a people with the opportunity for change--though never the promise that any given "utopia" will result.<br><br>"history" (not to mention PRE-history) can be muddy enough, and the future is impossible to know with any certainty. what does that leave? the present. and in this context, i prefer an earlier essay of Sharon's, "The Theory of Anyway" (http://www.energybulletin.net/25115.html) <br>in which she describes very much my own feelings: <br><br>"My friend Pat Meadows, a very, very smart woman, has a wonderful idea she calls "The Theory of Anyway." What it entails is this - she argues that 95% of what is needed to resolve the coming crises in energy depletion, or climate change, or most other global crises are the same sort of efforts. When in doubt about how to change, we should change our lives to reflect what we should be doing "Anyway.""<br><br>i would take that just a bit futher than she did in that piece, and say that any action which benefits "the common good" also benefits ME--maybe not always in terms of physical comfort, or of immediate rewards, but ultimately, as a being who is part of one whole.<br><br>to that end, i wonder if it might be possible to tweak the current, common understanding of the Apocalyptic Narrative, so that it can become a useful and adaptive Story? <br><br>Apocalypses (Apocalypsi?) come and go, in larger and smaller ways, all the time, what matters is what we make of them, in our own times and places. there is room for more than one response, to be the "right" one here.<br><br>(apologies for length, and for possibly going a bit off-topic. as before, i am impressed with the level of conversation often found here in your comments, JMG.)<br><br>-patricia<br><br><a href=is-history-on-anyones-side.html#c495459448102047595 title="comment permalink">6/6/07, 5:45 PM</a><br><br>

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c4549274517849426976></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/10068631538184332192 rel=nofollow>jason</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt><i>...one thing I've learned over the years is that nobody pitching apocalyptic myth likes to be compared to people pitching other versions of the same myth.</i><br><br>It's broader than that--no one, regardless of their mythic framework, likes to be compared to other people pitching other versions of the same myth. It's practically the definition of "pigeon-holing," or "stereotyping," or a "straw man." In a previous thread, you deleted a comment of mine invoking Godwin's Law simply because I pointed out that the primitivist apocalyptic narrative has no more in common with Christian apocalyptic than <a href=http://www.spunk.org/texts/places/germany/sp001630/peter.html rel=nofollow>the cyclical, agrarian ideal you've espoused has in common with the Nazis</a>. Sure, if we stick to the broad outline of the narrative, we can find plenty of points in common in both cases--were it not for its history, a concept like <i>blot und boden</i> would be very clearly aligned with your own. But neither comparison is particularly fair; both trade specifics for vague generalizations, both dismiss the defining details in favor of insinuation. Both amount to little more than pigeon-holing dismissal. No, I don't think it would be fair to compare you to the Nazis--just as I don't think it's fair to compare me to a Fundamentalist waiting for the Rapture. There are some vague, general similarities, because we're all humans and the human brain is only capable of so many basic kinds of narrative. That's why <i>no one</i> likes to hear their narrative dismissed so quickly as nothing more than a rehash of such-and-such, because it's fundamentally unfair.<br><br><i>It's all the same narrative, and the specific set of facts used to justify it matters very little, because the narrative governs the selection and meaning of facts. You must have noticed that people who disagree with you consistently refuse to accept the meaning you assign to your long lists of facts. That's not just cussedness; it's because they disagree with the interpretive scheme that comes with your narrative, and so facts that seem conclusive to you (because your narrative defines them so) mean something else to them (because their narrative puts different interpretations on them).</i><br><br>This does happen to some extent, but it's not nearly so cut-and-dried. I did not always have this narrative; my narrative changed (at great personal cost), because my old narrative could not satisfactorily account for the facts I had gathered. My new narrative does, so I keep it unless and until I gain some new set of facts that it fails to account for. I think this is basically how we all operate; changing a framework is a costly move, personally, so we will try to fit new facts into the same framework. Some try harder than others, of course, adn those who try hardest we call "ideologues" and "zealots," but it's certainly not the case that facts can be reworked endlessly. Some evidence truly is conclusive. It was evidence that forced me to change my framework, and it was evidence that forced every other primitivist to change theirs. It's far too young a movement for anyone to have really been raised as a primitivist yet, so nearly all of us at some point in our lives rejected our old framework because it failed to take account of what we'd come to know about the world, and accepted this one because it fit better. So while this is true to some degree, it has its limits. That's why discussion is valuable, because with sufficient good facts, a reasonable person can be persuaded to try on a different framework.<br><br><i>This is why it's so crucial to read narratives as narratives, and to notice how often the same narrative produces the same result, no matter what facts are used to fill in the preexisting slots in the structure. That's the point I'm trying to make here. </i><br><br>I understand that, and it's certainly a valuable undertaking, but there's also the peril that this can become a rationalization for pigeon-holing and stereotyping, rather than taking the unique details into consideration. The quality of the evidence that the narrative frames <i>is</i> important, and the details of the narrative <i>are</i> important. Collapse and the Rapture have some basic points in common, but the evidence for collapse is significantly different from the evidence for the Rapture. Collapse would entail massive die-off of the ill-adapted, which asks us to change our behavior and become better adapted. The Rapture will sweep away the Elect. These details matter: for an evangelical Christian, what happens to the earth is inconsequential; for a primitivist, what happens to the earth is crucical. To dismiss the conclusions we reach based on an assessment of scientific data because similiar predictions have been made in the past from scrutinizing ancient prophecies is simply a logical fallacy.<br><br>An assessment of mythic narrative is important, but it's also important to bear in mind the limits of narrative, and what kinds of details do make important differences.<br><br><i>For all you neo-primitivists, who believe that it takes centuries to rebuild depleted soils, I just want to tell you that today I transplanted 100 tomato plants to a patch of soil that 8 years ago could barely support Canada thistle and yarrow. All it took was green manure and lots of labor. Lots of labor.</i><br><br>Well, that's rather the key, isn't it? Like the "mythical man-month," you can always shorten time by increasing labor, or decrease labor by increasing time, but that's not the question. With all that labor you rehabilitated enough soil to grow 100 new tomato plants--and that's great! Congratulations! That's vital, crucial, important, and in another context I'd go on talking about how great that is for several more minutes, <i>but</i> if you're suggesting that this proves that agriculture, as a basis for society, is here to stay, I suggest you look at the scale. All of these arguments are fundamentally about scale. Could you do that for the whole of the Great Plains? Could you do that while simultaneously providing food for all those cities?<br><br>Scale matters.<br><br>There are lots of ways to improve soil. Heck, I'm building up a permaculture program for the Allegheny Plateau, and one of the first things I found out was how well oyster mushrooms work to clean up oil-soaked soil; I'm a huge fan of bioremediation. But these methods don't lend themselves to mass harvesting or long-distance transportation. They can feed me and my family, and even some of our friends and neighbors, very nicely. But they don't scale. The solutions that work in the future are all permacultural; I have yet to hear a single one that's genuinely agricultural. And the problem with permaculture is that it only scales up to the village level of population density. So where does that leave the cities? Urban permaculture programs are the best hope the cities have, with stronger neighborhood communities, but even that brings back echoes of the Ik in Uganda, or the way archaeologists have characterized post-Roman Britain as "life in towns rather than town life." You're still looking at the functional end of the city, replaced with a number of villages that just happen to be really close to one another.<br><br><i>JMG is correct that agriculture is an evolutionary advance in human society. The proof is simple. Agriculture has displaced hunting-gathering wherever agriculture is viable.</i><br><br>As Bill pointed out, "advance" has little room in actual evolutionary theory. Heck, by that logic, the reindeer of St. Matthew's Island had never had it so good, and an algae bloom is as good as it gets. Evolution often deals in experiments of trial and error, and it's actually pretty common for an experiment to become extremely prolific before it kills itself off.<br><br>Neighbor, I agree, and I'd like to see a specific statement like that, as well. It would really help; I'd like to find where, precisely, our disagreements are, and see how much of it is real and how much is misconception. It seems, for instance, that much of our disagreement lies in differing notions of permaculture vs. agriculture.<br><br><a href=is-history-on-anyones-side.html#c4549274517849426976 title="comment permalink">6/7/07, 11:39 AM</a><br><br>

I don't know of a better word to use for the variety of mythic narrative I've labeled "apocalyptic," but would gladly take suggestions. The "theory of anyway" falls fairly close to my own view, and certainly manages to put the rubber to the road where it belongs. <br><br>Alan, my read is that the expansion of leftwing parties in the '30s was pretty much a matter of trying to recover ground lost when the Second International imploded at the opening of the First World War. Still, your broader point is well taken -- times of crisis can open the door to many forms of change. Yes, unfortunately, I hear from a fair number of people -- and not just neoprimitivists -- who think that peak oil is their ticket to Utopia. <br><br>Loveandlight, you might want to do some reading in paleoclimatology. The level of temperature change predicted from global warming falls well within the range the planet has been through in the geologically recent past, and amounts to shifting climate bands northward a good deal. Mind you, there are apocalyptic claims being floated about global warming, too, but it's useful to compare those to the actual volume of carbon available in fossil fuels to be burnt -- many of the upper-range predictions assume much more carbon than is available to burn. <br><br>Dan, why does it not surprise me that you're a Distributist? Still, good to hear that there's not a lot of apocalyptic Utopianism among Distributists. As for the Long Defeat - that deserves a post all to itself, of course.<br><br>Rebecca, no argument there. <br><br>Neighbor, see the end of the post, where I've tried to answer your question in full. <br><br>Dwig, it's very precisely a matter of incommensurability, but from my perspective, it's an incommensurability of levels of discourse, rather than terms. More on this below.<br><br>Jason, what you're dismissing as pigeonholing is the core of what I'm trying to discuss here -- talking about narratives as narratives, comparing current narratives to older equivalents, and drawing conclusions based on that. I'm not surprised that you consider it unfair, as it doesn't support your project very well, but it's been the central theme of this blog all along. The "quality of information" used to support different versions of the same myth simply shows who's better at cherrypicking data to fit their narrative; I assure you that I've encountered Marxists who have just as many citations to back their prophecy as you have to back yours. <br><br>This is why I haven't been willing to get into a data-heaping match. Since you insist on violating Godwin's rule, though, I'll take the liberty of pointing out that the core narrative of German national socialism, far from being a cyclic myth, is yet another version of the standard apocalyptic narrative -- the imaginary paradise of Aryan racial purity fills the role you've given to the hunter-gatherer societies of the prehistoric past, the Jews that of civilization, the Final Solution that of the collapse of civilization, and so on. You might want to look at Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke's excellent studies of Nazi and neo-Nazi ideology for a good survey of this. <br><br>Still, Dwig is right; we're basically talking past each other, because I'm trying to pursue a discussion on one level and you want to pursue it on another. I think I can answer Neighbor and Vlad and clarify what I see as the core differences between our points of view. <br><br>Your narrative -- and please correct me if I'm wrong -- runs something very much like this: <br><br><i>Hunting and gathering is the best and most natural way for human beings to live. Agriculture, and the civilized way of life that grows out of it, is unnatural and harmful to human beings and the earth alike. The invention of agriculture launched humanity into a downward spiral of violence and ecological degradation, which is reaching its final culmination in industrial society, the most extreme form of the project of civilization. Since industrial society is using up all the resources that would allow any future society to engage in agriculture or build a civilized society, industrialism is also inevitably the last form of civilization, and will be followed with equal inevitability by a return to hunter-gatherer lifestyles and a restoration of harmony between human beings and the earth.</i><br><br>What I'm trying to say, by contrast, is something closer to this: <br><br><i>Industrial society is rapidly using up the cheap abundant energy that allowed it to come into being in the first place. Since none of the proposed alternatives seem to offer more than a fraction of the energies our civilization gets from fossil fuels, it's very likely - not certain, but very likely - that the industrial form of society will go into decline once its primary resources become too scarce to support it. This is not a new thing; many human societies have undergone the same sort of decline we're likely to undergo, and we can draw useful lessons from their experience. The most important of those lessons is that </i>there is no fixed narrative<i> that the future has to follow. Narratives are tools to think with. Those that have proved useful in previous situations like ours are probably going to be more helpful than ones that have usually resulted in failure or disaster. Our choice of narratives and actions, not some form of historical determinism, will shape the future that will emerge after industrial society has finished its slow descent.</i><br><br>Not just two different stories, but stories on two different levels. Yours is a universal story, one that claims to include all of human experience -- if there's a part of the world where civilization is actually a better option than hunting and gathering, for example, your narrative falls apart completely. Mine is much more restricted; it simply says that here we are, here's what will likely (not "inevitably") happen if things go on the way they are, here's some things we can probably do in response. At the same time, you're approaching narratives as statements of fact -- this narrative is true, that one isn't -- and I'm trying to approach them as tools -- this one usually has these effects, are you sure you want to use it here and now? It's no wonder there's little agreement between us.<br><br><a href=is-history-on-anyones-side.html#c5054929306267107488 title="comment permalink">6/7/07, 1:36 PM</a><br><br>

Can Danby all by himself improve the soil on the Great Plains? Of course not. Could thirty million homesteaders, using the same techniques he's used, do so? Of course. Thus his point stands; damaged soils can be improved rapidly using methods that will be readily available in a deindustrial society, and this means that your insistence that agriculture can't be viable in the future rests on air. <br><br>More generally, your characterization of agriculture as an evolutionary failure is an interpretation derived from your narrative, not a simple matter of fact. It would be just as easy to argue that we're seeing the first archaeopteryx-flappings of a new evolutionary venture; doubtless those first Jurassic birds didn't fly very well, either, and ran into trees and the mouths of hungry dinosaurs often enough. So? It takes time -- rather more than 8000 years -- to perfect a leap forward that radical, and the evolution of organic agriculture in recent years has shown that there are plenty of ways agriculture can respond to the problems of the present and near future. <br><br>No, I'm not saying that this alternative narrative is "true" - I'm saying that it's just as defensible as yours. One of the points Kuhn raises in <i>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i>, as I recall, is that it's possible to propose an infinite number of hypotheses to explain any given data set. This is another reason why arguing over the facts cited to support a narrative is less useful than it looks; the same facts, arranged in a different narrative, lead to completely different conclusions.<br><br><a href=is-history-on-anyones-side.html#c605679892844376004 title="comment permalink">6/7/07, 1:49 PM</a><br><br>

Those first feathery dinosaur-like critters weren't evolving with the objective of learning to soar like eagles. They were just as adapted to their own particular niche and life history as a hummingbird or swallow is today. Whatever the selective force was that first caused scales to turn into feathers, it was not looking forward to catching a thermal and sailing across pangea. Perhaps it was just trying to keep a little warmer at night to maintain a higher body temperature; then the selection might have been for fluffier forelimbs to help jump higher after flying bugs, then maybe longer feathers for sailing jumps, etc., etc. The point is, there was no goal, each step was adaptive in the present, not striving for a future. <br><br>Of course I know you were really just engaging in a little rhetorical license to make a cute and funny metaphor. But I thought I'd grab your metaphor by its prototypical tail feathers. Because the comparison is valid: In spite of extensive rhetoric about the future, in fact societies exist in the present and must adapt and function within current circumstances under contemporary stresses and influences. Societies are of course evolving into something new all the time, but they must also serve for their present occupants. If they don't keep the basic functions going they won't persist. No matter how much some societal change might be of benefit in advancing towards a future utopia, if it does not yield a fully functional society at every intermediate step before acheiving that goal, it won't happen. <br><br>This is a point that seems so obvious, yet is so often missed. People will not give up their MallWart Supercenters in exchange for tilling and hoeing and sweating until the later becomes a better <i>immediate</i> option than the former. You can preach about the future end times as much as you want, but until the tradeoff become immediate, tangible, and undeniable in real time, society <i>en mass</i> will not make such a fundamental shift. Conversely, if the tradeoffs <i>do</i> become all those things, then society <i>will</i> make that shift, possible quite rapidly. But if the forces push in some other direction, society will go that way instead, no matter how much anyone's morality, logic, and iron-clad predictive models of the long-term impacts scream otherwise.<br><br>Individuals, and even entire communities and subcultures, can quite easily adopt alternative ways of living vastly different from the societal norms. But society as a whole won't follow until and unless it is shoved that way by immediacy and urgent necessity.<br><br>I think this was embodied in your concept of Cycles of Sustainability. In response to new stresses, society responds and adapts to those stresses and then likely stabilizes for a while. Then the stresses change, and society must change again, <i>but only as far as is necessary to reestablish and maintain fundamental functionality</i>, not in a great leap into some vastly altered ideal.

A few key examples:<br><br>(1) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_Law" rel=nofollow>Godwin's Law</a>. To quote another bit of "internet culture," from <i>The Princess Bride</i>, "You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means." Godwin's Law comments on the tendency of internet exchanges to become increasingly hysterical, until someone declares the enemy a Nazi, or, as Wikipedia puts it, "This is due to the side who invoked the comparison to Hitler or Nazis ramping up the rhetoric to a point where normal discussion is impossible and the discussion ends."<br><br>I'm not calling you a Nazi. In fact, I'm saying you're <i>not</i> a Nazi, just like I'm not an evangelical Christian waiting for the Rapture. Now of course, there are some major, important differences between your viewpoint and that of the Nazis. Of course, there are major, important differences between my viewpoint and that of evangelical Christians, differences you keep insisting on dismissing as trivial. But the fact remains that a significant element in the historical formation of the Nazi Party formed from the very same Romantic, agrarian notions that informed the Druidic movement later on. The early ideas about turning away from industrialism, the destructive mythology of progress espoused by industrialism, the return to the agrarian ideal, the bioregionalism of <i>blot und boden</i> and other ideas outlined in the article I linked to above are as similar to your narrative as the evangelical Rapture is to mine--that is to say, similar in broad outline, but crucially different in important details.<br><br>(2) You said, "...what you're dismissing as pigeonholing is the core of what I'm trying to discuss here..." Of course, I had said, "...it's certainly a valuable undertaking, but there's also the peril that this can become a rationalization for pigeon-holing and stereotyping, rather than taking the unique details into consideration." How many times do I have to repeat that it's an important pursuit before you'll stop saying I'm dismissing you? It is precisely <i>because</i> it's such an important pursuit that makes it so important to do it right. If I were to pursue the ramifications of your mythical narrative and started really running with the aforementioned Nazi comparison, you would immediately recognize where I was going wrong. Yes, you both agree in a basic agrarian ideal, a rejection of industrialism, bioregionalism, etc., <i>but</i> where the Nazis took this to indict those they saw as lacking a connection to a particular soil (Jews and gypsies, primarily), you take a very different appraoch. Of course, if we're looking at the broad outline of narrative, this is a fairly minor detail--just like the difference that I'm looking at anthropological and scientific data, while Christians are scrutinizing ancient prophecies, is a fairly minor detail. Would you be very content with me sweeping such cherry-picked trivialities off the table, as you do in my case? I doubt it very much; you keep crying "Godwin! Godwin!" just to my suggestion that you <i>shouldn't</i> be compared to the Nazis! An analysis of narrative is not pigeon-holing unless it is done poorly, without respect to the very crucial details that can change the whole outcome of a narrative structure.<br><br>In short, all I'm asking for is that you take some time to try to understand what I'm saying, and appreciate the nuances that make different positions actually different. When you don't, then your analysis simply devolves into pigeon-holing, leaving a very important project undone. It's not just a disservice to me and those who believe as I do, but to your own body of work, a disservice that I would not care nearly so much about if it were not so valuable.<br><br>In my next comment, I'll respond to your outline of what you take to be my narrative.<br><br><a href=is-history-on-anyones-side.html#c8007886347207846977 title="comment permalink">6/8/07, 1:50 PM</a><br><br>

Did you happen to read <a href=http://anthropik.com/2007/05/answering-the-archdruid/ rel=nofollow>the response I posted</a> to your post of two weeks ago? There, I pointed to the story of "the Prodigal Son" in Luke 15:11-32 as one I find fairly representative of my views. But allow me to take a look at what you've written here:<br><br><i>Hunting and gathering is the best and most natural way for human beings to live.</i><br><br>This is somewhat too universal. Humans, like anything else, evolve. We evolved as hunter-gatherers. It's our home, it's what we do. Any major change from that will take many hundreds of thousands of years to really adapt to. This is basically correct, but the tone is just a tad too cosmic to really resonate with my view.<br><br><i>Agriculture, and the civilized way of life that grows out of it, is unnatural and harmful to human beings and the earth alike. </i><br><br>Again, natural vs. unnatural have little meaning for me or most other primitivists. But we do see agriculture as an abandonment of humanity's evolutionary heritage, and the problems that follow largely being of maladaptation--trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.<br><br><i>The invention of agriculture launched humanity into a downward spiral of violence and ecological degradation, which is reaching its final culmination in industrial society, the most extreme form of the project of civilization.</i><br><br>This I can largely agree with--these problems being largely the consequence of humans denied their human nature--again, the problem of a square peg in a round hole.<br><br><i>Since industrial society is using up all the resources that would allow any future society to engage in agriculture or build a civilized society, industrialism is also inevitably the last form of civilization, and will be followed with equal inevitability by a return to hunter-gatherer lifestyles and a restoration of harmony between human beings and the earth.</i><br><br>This is a somewhat smaller point, one I wouldn't really put into such a basic "statement of vision." Rather, the larger emphasis is on agriculture as a passing blip, "<a href=http://art.afterculture.org/Timeline.html rel=nofollow>a brief disturbance in the force</a>," an example of overshoot, no more, no less. The exhaustion of resources is one reason why, but from the long view, it really has more to do with the fact that by our narrative, the narrative that civilization is humanity's true destiny is a delusion born from a lack of historical perspective.<br><br>I've tried to condense my narrative before; <a href=http://anthropik.com/thirty rel=nofollow>The Thirty Theses</a> were the product of such an attempt to break my view down into 30 statements I could defend. But if I were to try to express my own narrative in such terms, I think it would go more like this:<br><br><i>Humans evolved as hunter-gatherers and permaculturalists, no better or worse than any other. At the beginning of the Holocene interglacial, though, some groups threw off their whole evolutionary heritage and began living in a wildly different and unhuman way. Of course, humans don't do very well living in ways that aren't human, so ecological destruction followed. But this is ultimately an abberation; we live in a historical anomoly. Ultimately, this blip is self-defeating and unsustainable, and humanity will live like humans again, probably sooner rather than later.</i><br><br>So, my narrative is much more of a curve with some "goodness of fit," than the universal rule you seem to take it for. I fully expect some isolated pockets to be farming and building cities even 500 years from now.<br><br>Of course, we may also be using very different terms. In the thread following my aforementioned response, Geoff made some comments about agriculture and horticulture, to which I responded with <a href=http://anthropik.com/2007/05/answering-the-archdruid/#comment-131277 rel=nofollow>a clarification on how they differ</a>. In short, I reject the idea that degree of modification is a useful criteria--"modification" is far too broad. The better question is what <i>kind</i> of modification we're using. The difference between agriculture and permaculture is that agriculutre is geared towards repressing succession (Manning's catastrophism, the plow as portable natural disaster replicator), while permaculture helps succession along. Thus, the dividing line between the hunter-gatherer/permacultural continuum and agriculture becomes, "When you're done, is your landbase richer or poorer for what you've done?" That makes agriculture unsustainable <i>by definition</i>, because it's the set of techniques that diminish an ecology. And yet, this is also the criteria one finds among traditional peoples, and I believe it's really the only criteria that matters. Certainly everything we normally think of as farming--tilling, monocropping, domestication, etc.--falls under this definition of agriculture, while every technique you've so far mentioned of a "sustainable agriculture" is an established permacultural technique. This is why the result of my long correspondence with Toby Hemenway helped to inspire him to write, "<a href=http://www.patternliteracy.com/sustag.html rel=nofollow>Is 'Sustainable Agriculture' an Oxymoron?</a>"<br><br>Does this reduce this all to an argument over semantics? I don't think so; I think the difference in semantics reflects a pernicious little narrative of the "untrammeled wilderness." I've outlined this in greater depth in <a href=http://anthropik.com/2007/05/answering-the-archdruid/#comment-131277 rel=nofollow>the aforementioned comment</a>, so I won't take up more space here except to direct interested parties there for a deeper explanation.<br><br><a href=is-history-on-anyones-side.html#c6066244154508666867 title="comment permalink">6/8/07, 2:17 PM</a><br><br>

Can Danby all by himself improve the soil on the Great Plains? Of course not. Could thirty million homesteaders, using the same techniques he's used, do so? Of course.</i><br><br>Of course <i>not</i>--how much land does it take to grow 100 tomato plants? 100 square feet? So, 30 million homesteaders could restore 3 trillion feet of soil. That's a little over 107 square miles. That's less than 9% of Rhode Island. To do that just for Texas would take 72 billion people, 12 times today's already bloated world population. And that would still leave most of the Great Plains barren, with only Texas restored.<br><br>It's not a dismissal at all; soil regeneration will be vital to our future. But as Danby pointed out, it takes a lot of work. Restoring the soil for your own permaculture garden, helping the ecology of your own range, these things will be vital. But it is simply beyond our capacity to repair the damage we've caused.<br><br><i>No, I'm not saying that this alternative narrative is "true" - I'm saying that it's just as defensible as yours.</i><br><br>Except that it's not. Archaeopteryx was not an oxymoron, as agriculture is. Note, I'm not saying cultivation, but agriculture. Making your living by mimicking a natural disaster, by destroying your land base. Evolution often takes time, a lot longer than a mere 10,000 years, but it makes mistakes, too. That narrative is not as defensible as mine because it doesn't take the facts into consideration.<br><br><i>One of the points Kuhn raises in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, as I recall, is that it's possible to propose an infinite number of hypotheses to explain any given data set.</i><br><br>He did, and I think that's true. But infinite is not unlimited. A hypothesis does need to account for the facts. Those facts can be accounted for by an infinite number of permutations, but any good hypothesis in that infinite set must explain those data points. There's also an infinite set of narratives that would not make viable hypotheses, because they don't account for the data.<br><br><i>One of the points Kuhn raises in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, as I recall, is that it's possible to propose an infinite number of hypotheses to explain any given data set.</i><br><br>Perhaps, but that's precisely why discussing them is so important. Even if you don't accept another's hypothesis, a healthy respect for the validity of other hypotheses is how you learn other stories, which, as you say, is the root of wisdom.<br><br><i>...But I do think that it's quite possible that Mesozoic birds didn't fly as well as later ones, because selective pressure would push in the direction of greater effectiveness over time, up to a point of diminishing returns. </i><br><br>Funny, "No one right way to live," is practically the battle cry for Daniel Quinn, the primitivist author who most inspired me. I think that given our history, hunting and gathering will likely be the most adaptable way of life in the future, just as it has been in the past. And I also think that agriculture is coming to an end. Of course, "hunting and gathering" encompasses a huge plethora of cultures and ways of life, from the Inuit to the Plains Indians to the Kwakiutl to the Pygmies to the Bushmen to the Australian Aborigines, etc. They account for nearly all of the cultural diversity in the human species. By the same token, agriculture is remarkably homogenous around the world; a small handful of social ruminants and an equally small handful of cereal grains, all depending on the mimicry of natural disasters to suppress succession, creating large pools of poor, hungry, malnourished peasants who go to an early grave, ruled over by 10% of the population who gets to rule as elites. Drop ot somewhere around 8%, or rise up as high as 12% like the Maya did, and your civilization collapses. Permaculture may work in the long term; it's only been 10,000 years so it's difficult to say, but it certainly shows promise so far. But I'm not saying there's one right way to live, heavens no. I'm saying that this one, the one we're in, is suicidal.<br><br><i>...at least a few small city-like centers of stored knowledge and exchange of ideas and goods and services.</i><br><br>There are some interesting permutations that the future will undoubtedly take on. Some that I anticipate include:<br><br>(1) The regional fairs, being the "TAZ" approach to cities. Huge festivals that gather thousands together for a brief period, and then disperse before the ecological toll becomes too great.<br><br>(2) The Holy City. Some of the early civilizations in the Andes began with ritual centers fed by devout neighboring tribes. Another variant is the Trade City, like Cahokia.<br><br><i>My objection is the attempt to claim that it's the only option. Or that anything else is the only option, for that matter.</i><br><br>That hasn't been my position. I'm just as excited about permaculture, even moreso in the short term. Of course, permaculture dovetails very nicely and easily with hunting and gathering. I don't have one option for the future; I just know one thing that <i>doesn't</i> work. That it happens to be the way that nearly all of us are living is a cause for some concern, but the future is myriad. The fact that we've lumped such a huge diversity of lifeways under a single heading is deceptive. You might as well call it "not-cultivating," because it includes anything and everything else.<br><br><i>...sugar cane for the sugar...</i><br><br>There are plenty of substitutes for this, too, such as stevia. We've got a great little stevia plant that I hope will one day be Grandfather Stevia to a whole load of stevia plants to sweeten the days of my grandchildren. :)<br><br><i>My problem with agriculture and civilization is that it has a long history of expanding and of being intolerant of other ways of living. So when you defend it so ardently it scares me somewhat.</i><br><br>Aye. It's easy to see why farmers are fundamentally incapable of living side-by-side with anyone other than themselves, and we've certainly seen that played out in history. I live in Pennsylvania, "the Quaker State." The Society of Friends very much wanted to deal fairly with the Indians. But they couldn't, as much as they tried. They tried to sue on behalf of the Cornplanter Seneca when the Army Corps of Engineers started building Kinzua Dam, for instance, but it didn't do any good. Today, Pennsylvania has no Indian reservations. It's not a matter of narrative, myth or vision--when your way of life is fundamentally incapable of co-existence with any other way of life, you will be compelled to annihilate all other ways of life, whether you want to or not. Even when groups that didn't want to were in charge, they couldn't stop it. Pennsylvania's colonial history is a fine llustration of that.<br><br><a href=is-history-on-anyones-side.html#c3209647802245682547 title="comment permalink">6/8/07, 2:48 PM</a><br><br>

I'm not presenting a narrative; my point is exactly that getting stuck in a single narrative is counterproductive. Your concept of antenarrative is a good starting place for discussion, though. As for end user documentation, that's what I've been trying to do on this blog for the last year... <br><br>Dwig, I've heard of some of these projects; if they can be made to work with equipment that can be made using the simpler tools that will likely be available in deindustrial society, that would be great. I expect radio to remain viable over the long term, so at least a communications net ought to be possible. <br><br>Alan, your comment on agriculture fits my views closely. One of my objections to the whole range of romanticizations of the past - neoprimitive, agrarian, or what have you - is that they ignore the positive achievements of modern society. Of course there have been negative as well as positive sides to industrialism, but the point of this blog isn't to denounce industrial society - it's to suggest that, for good or ill, it's drawing to its close, and we really ought to think about what might come after it.<br><br>I would be happiest if we could preserve as much as possible of the cultural, intellectual, and practical heritage of modernity into the deindustrial era; how that heritage will be put to use will have to change in the absence of cheap abundant fossil fuel energy, but it might just keep us from making some of the same miserable mistakes, to borrow your useful phrase. <br><br>As for the leftists in the 1930s, sorry if I was too cryptic. What I was trying to say is that the left suffered a huge loss of prestige and influence at the time of the First World War, for reasons that would take us rather far off topic, and the communist and socialist parties of Europe were still recovering from that in the early 30s - thus some degree of growth during that time could be expected, as a new generation came within reach of propaganda. My reading (which admittedly was a long time ago) suggested that those gains were rather limited; the left never got as big or as influential as it was before the First World War, and so the difference in economic conditions seemed like one relevant factor. <br><br>It's also instructive to compare the number of countries in the Western world that made a significant leftward shift during the 30s with the much larger number that moved to the right. The US was as I recall nearly alone in embracing a leftist agenda, while something not much short of a dozen European countries fell under far right totalitarian rule. Not much there to support the claim that the Great Depression was empowering for the left. <br><br>As for peak oil Utopians, good heavens, do you think I keep them on file? I roll my eyes and hit the delete button. Most of the ones I've seen so far, other than the neoprimitivists, either insist that peak oil will bring about a solar powered agrarian Ecotopia or go to the other end of the political spectrum and expect it to bring a conservative utopia with precious metal currency, small government, and no immigration. <br><br>Jason, I'm not even going to bother. I've already stated my disagreements with your views; you've explained why you don't think my criticisms apply, which is of course your right, but doesn't change the fact that your arguments fail to convince me; we could go around and around, but what's the point? Equally, I could hash through why it's a use of Nazism as rhetorical bogeyman to claim "Linking my narrative with its sources in Christian apocalyptic is equivalent to equating your religious tradition with Nazism," but I don't see any reason to think that would sink in, either. <br><br>For more than a month now you've insisted on dragging every conversation here back around to why you think your particular apocalyptic narrative is true. There are plenty of other forums, starting with your own website (that's <a href=http://www.anthropik.com rel=nofollow>www.anthropik.com</a>, for anyone who hasn't found it yet and wants to hear more of Jason's theories), where you can hold forth to your heart's content, so I think at this point I'm going to have to ask you to leave. This forum exists to talk about other things, and the conversations I'm trying to foster are getting drowned out by your attempts to make yourself and your views the center of attention.

I would note, though, that I think everyone here is throwing the word apocalypse around fairly freely. I personally, for example, don't believe that peak oil *is* an apocalypse of any sort, particularly the narrative one. <br><br>Becoming poor, which is, I believe, the most likely outcome of peak oil - to paraphrase Freud, experiencing what few Americans have "ordinary human poverty" of the sort that truly poor folk all over the world experience - is not apocalyptic, it is merely difficult. <br><br>That is, the notion that peak oil can help move people towards political change is rather different than the notion that the world will become radically other than what it has been. I agree that for those of us in rich nations, the world we live in will look rather different. But this transformation is mostly a re-creation of our own collective past (in 1940, for example, 1/5 of the US had no electricity or running water, few people made more than 1K per year, and less than 1 percent made the equivalent in today's dollars of a million dollars a year), and a revisiting of what we've done to other people.<br><br>I like the stuff you do with narrative, but I do wonder whether it wouldn't be worth questioning the very usage of the term apocalyptic, and similar assumptions. <br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Sharon<br><br><a href=is-history-on-anyones-side.html#c448710671322241922 title="comment permalink">6/10/07, 7:10 AM</a><br><br>

I've been suggesting for a while now that the apocalyptic mythos so common today - basically a rehash of the Book of Revelation in secular drag - has become a straitjacket around the western world's collective imagination of its own future. You might want to take a look at the <a href=../../2007/03/round-in-circles-review-of-david-c_21.html rel=nofollow>third part of my review</a> of David Korten's <i>The Great Turning</i> or my post <a href=../../2007/01/immanentizing-eschaton.html rel=nofollow>Immanentizing the Eschaton</a> for the background to this week's conversation. <br><br>Of course peak oil isn't the apocalypse. It most likely marks the beginning of the end of the industrial economy, and thus of the social forms that grew up around that mode of production; there will be quite a bit of change over the next century or two as a world used to cheap abundant energy has to get used to getting by on a lot less; some of that change will likely take the form of discontinuities of various kinds - economic, political, and technological. None of that justifies the apocalyptic fantasies that have taken peak oil as their latest excuse. <br><br>So your point is well taken -- what we're facing in the future is simply a matter of most people becoming poorer than they are today, and having to go back (or forward) to less extravagant ways of living. For many people these days, that prospect is depressing enough that it's no wonder apocalyptic fantasies are so popular!<br><br><a href=is-history-on-anyones-side.html#c4210174212807174942 title="comment permalink">6/10/07, 12:51 PM</a><br><br>

You like to joke about the ''space brothers'', so do I, but have you heard about Fermi paradox? If there are civilizations in the universe, where are they? They should already be here. <br><br>Maybe, if we pass this "mankind final exam", if we prove to them that we can master our destructive instincts by ourselves, they will show up? Who knows? <br><br>Therefore, it not absurd to believe that those who get ready have more influence than those who let others decide for them, including those who communicate with the "space brothers".<br><br>I believe, we are about to enter uncharted territories in every sense of the word.

There are also the full range of indian prophecies which are conceptually interesting<br>(The West is not able to grasp the concept of change meaningfully, but indians are). We must look in that type of direction for the right story, the one that motivates people. It has nothing to do with politics or any other sophisticated type of thinking.

It takes around 10 acres of forest to heat a poorly insulated house to what we now consider a comfortable level, if the 10 acres are natural woodland. Make the house energy efficient (earth sheltered, passive solar, etc.) and grow firewood by coppicing, and a small back yard will be enough. The New Alchemy Institute had one of their "arks" in the maritime provinces of Canada, which aren't exactly warm, and needed only a little firewood in the coldest part of the year. So there are ways to make wood heat much more sustainable. <br><br>Jean-Michel, I agree that the future isn't set in stone, but I'm too much the ecologist to believe that anything is possible. While there's a lot of positive change that can still happen, the choices of the last few decades have closed off a lot of options. <br><br>As for ETs, if they have the sense the gods gave geese, they redlined our solar system about the time the first broadcasts of <i>My Mother the Car</i> reached Proxima Centauri and haven't been back since. To my mind, claims that ETs will show up and bail us out of the consequences of our own mistakes are just another round of Cargo Cult logic, and Carl Jung's analysis of UFOs as psychic projections has a lot more going for it than the claim that they must be spaceships from other worlds. Yes, I'm familiar with Fermi's paradox, but talking about the ways it depends on the mythology of progress would take us very far off topic. <br><br>Finally, I disagree that the territory ahead of us is new to our species. Plenty of civilizations and humbler societies as well, right down to the hunter-gatherer level, have used up the resources they depended on for survival, gone into catabolic collapse, and faded out, to be replaced by new societies. That's the situation we're in, too, and we can learn a great deal by paying attention to past examples. It's unpopular to suggest that we can learn from history, not least because history usually teaches lessons we'd rather not learn, but to my mind it's one of the best resources we've got.<br><br><a href=is-history-on-anyones-side.html#c3921425921425828340 title="comment permalink">6/11/07, 2:35 PM</a><br><br>

We would probably see a huge variety of social groups - ranging from strictly religious to miniature democracy to intellectual/artistic to single-sex to local tyrants ruling through fear, etc. In other words, a much smaller-scale version of what we already see in the world now; with some new variations. <br><br>(Hunter-gatherer vs. agrarian seems moot, as likely most folks will do both, depending on where they live. The fact that farming may be a bad idea in the human long run won't stop anyone who is hungry from growing potatoes...we can't turn back the clock. Also, it could be argued that whatever humanity comes up with is 'natural' for humans...but that's another topic.)<br><br>Unfortunately, for a society to be successful at 'being utopian', (meaning fair, no one better off than others, no one taken advantage of, environment respected, future needs accounted for, etc.) everyone in it, and more imporatantly around it, must think the same way; or at least be willing to respect your rights and leave you alone. Utopia can't last if your neighboring society (or a lot of passers by) are dictatorial, or selfish, or acquisitive, or significantly more forceful or uncaring than you - for example, if they dam the river upstream, so much for your utopia. <br><br>The likelihood of this kind of society happening with any lasting success also shrinks in proportion to the number of participants in it. However, if a large number of us instill 'utopian' values in our children, eventually such would probably happen on a larger scale- a very long time from now, after much upheaval and decades of hardship.

Doesn't it inevitably fall out of the fossil-fueled technological boom? And won't another narrative fall out just as naturally from the post-Hubbert contraction? I guess the question is, is it really a straight jacket, or is it a rubber suit that will adjust itself as circumstances change?

What we are likely to see in the 20 or 40 or 60 years we have left is episodes of scarcity, increasing in magnitude, but intermittent and spotty. We will also see significant accomodation to this scarcity, through many avenues, some of it violent, some of it peaceful and controlled. But probably nearly everything we have now will still be available to some extent, at some price, at the end of our lives. Our grandchildren and great-grandchildren (or -nieces, -nephews, and younger cousins 2 and 3 times removed for us childless sorts) will be the old geezers blathering endlessly and tiresomely about the good old days when you just flipped a switch and the house was warm all winter and cool all summer, yada yada yada. Their grandkids will grow up without ever having had this as an expectation, and will be much more content with diminished affluence and comfort levels than we would be if chucked into it cold turkey tomorrow.<br><br><a href=is-history-on-anyones-side.html#c4551287255023939659 title="comment permalink">6/12/07, 12:28 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c8873199514989621819></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/04737693388485635100 rel=nofollow>John Michael Greer</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Caryl, no argument there. One of the worst things about periods of decline is the way moral concerns get chucked out like last week's fishwrap when people start to panic about maintaining their standard of living. Of course there's a reaction the other way -- as Toynbee points out, it's not accidental that most of the world's major religions took shape in periods of decline like the one we're heading into. <br><br>Lusus, well put - one of the most likely themes in the story of the future is that there won't be just one story of the future, and that opens doors for various kinds of creative work, within the limits of ecological reality. <br><br>Rebecca, you're right that terms are bandied about very loosely in this field, as in so many others. I don't know that anybody has hard and fast definitions that would be accepted by everyone. What defines an apocalypse, from my perspective, is that it's the climax of a particular kind of mythic narrative that begins with a paradise of primal innocence, proceeds through some form of fall from grace into a long age of suffering, and then ends with a bang as whatever the story considers evil blows itself up, and paradise returns. <br><br>Whenever you've got that sequence -- paradise, fall, suffering, and redemption through destruction -- you've got an apocalyptic myth. Collapse and decline are much more generally applicable terms, and mark the ends of a spectrum of social change; a collapse happens relatively fast, and a decline relatively slowly. Many events in history can be described in either way, depending on where you draw the line. <br><br>Since these are general terms, you can have apocalyptic myths that end in collapse, and you can also have apocalyptic myths that end in decline -- though this latter is a good deal less common. On the other hand, there are theories and predictions of collapse and decline that aren't apocalyptic, because they don't import the rest of the myth -- the primal paradise, the Fall, and all that. <br><br>Bill, yes, one of the things that shows how unrealistic we've gotten in the US is the preposterous size of new housing. The next round of energy crises ought to put paid to a lot of that. <br><br>As far as narratives and societies, well, to some extent it's a chicken and egg scenario. Over time, narratives shift to accommodate experienced reality, but at any given point in time, the narratives we're familiar with can sharply restrict the possibilities we can imagine, and thus act on. During the rising arc of industrial society, the myth of progress worked -- that's why it got so solidly established. The problem is that familiar narratives can stay on for quite a while when the conditions that originally fostered them have long since changed. <br><br>You also get narratives that are good at replicating themselves because they appeal to powerful emotional drives, but produce dysfunctional responses to the world. The myth of racial superiority is a good example of a dysfunctional narrative -- emotionally appealing, especially to people of a once-dominant group who feel their status threatened, but self-defeating in every practical sense. <br><br>As for your final comment, yes, exactly, and thank you! Nobody alive today will see the arrival of the deindustrial societies of the future; this is one of the core ideas I've been trying to communicate all along. Civilizations take a long time to fall, and the Hubbert curve is a bell-shaped curve -- that means it'll take right around as much time to sink back to zero as it took to rise up from zero in the first place. If peak oil happens in 2010, that means the world will be able to pump about as much oil in 2040 as it did in 1980, as much in 2090 as in 1930, and so on. This is one of the reasons I sometimes get exasperated with people who insist on redefining what I'm trying to say into a narrative of overnight collapse.<br><br><a href=is-history-on-anyones-side.html#c8873199514989621819 title="comment permalink">6/12/07, 2:02 PM</a><br><br>

Complex adaptive systems can change "modes" pretty rapidly on occasion (e.g., the melting of the glaciers that was thought to take centuries to occur, but recent evidence shows can take place over a few decades). On the way up, you had societies mostly building on past experience, with a confidence that they were doing the right thing, going the right direction. On the way down, you'll have a lot of demoralized, uncertain, and sometimes outright desparate people, which doesn't make for a nice controlled decline. There may be about as much oil to pump in 2040 as 1980, but will we have the necessary social and political relationships and cohesion to keep the extraction and distribution system going?<br><br>Which kind of segues into: I've been considering what might be the "internal requirements" for individual and group survival over the timescales you're talking about. I've come up with some strawman "rules of community", which I offer for dialogue:<br><br>Rule 1: Don't try to go it alone, or even with a small group of family and/or friends. You need enough people to create a society.<br><br>Rule 2: Social cohesion is a crucial factor for success; put differently, you need to create a true community (or leverage an existing one).<br><br>Rule 3 (law of requisite variety): You'll need a variety of roles, skills, viewpoints, and personality types. It's true of communities as well as biomes: a rich web of relationships among diverse entities is more survivable than a sparse one or a “monoculture”.<br><br>Rule 4: No matter how well you plan for your future, you're going to be surprised. Build a capacity for continuous learning into the community (in Peter Senge's terms, become a learning organization).<br><br>Rule 5: In particular, learn to see whole systems, and to understand/perceive cross-time trends, relationships, etc. As an example of the latter, understand the interplay between normal change and revolutionary change; learn to be good at both.<br><br>Rule 6: As for individuals, so for communities: don't try to go it alone -- form communities of communities within your region.<br><br>Rule 7: In particular, you need enough people within the region to provide a viable breeding population, and to avoid genetic stagnation. Exogamy is good for the genes and, by enriching the web of relationships, for the society.<br><br>Rule 8: Aim to thrive, not just eke out a survival. Pessimism and despair have negative survival value. Consider yourselves not refugees from a doomed civilization, but founders of a new one.<br><br>Rule 9: That said, allow yourselves occasional time to grieve, to mourn, to remember, and to honor those lost. This will keep them from becoming “elephants in the room”, an unspoken burden on your spirits.<br><br>Rule 10: Develop an understanding and acceptance of the role of death in life.<br><br>Commentary:<br><br>I use the word "rule" with considerable trepidation -- I have no authority to make rules, just to offer what seem to me to be salient points. If you prefer something like "tentative suggestion", please read the above that way.<br><br>I'm certainly not the only person to propose community as an important, even crucial factor for long-term survival --- it's a theme that has arisen in many places; however, I haven't seen this kind of focus on the nature of and requirements for a strong community.<br><br>This list is definitely not comprehensive; there are certainly other "rules" of this kind that are as important as these. On the other hand, I do think that all of these are necessary elements to have a chance for long-term survival.<br><br><a href=is-history-on-anyones-side.html#c4145972915243893710 title="comment permalink">6/12/07, 8:44 PM</a><br><br>

Global oil production may be less critical than the availability of exportable oil. Westexas's Export Land model on TOD is relevant here. Global oil production in 2040 may be similar to global production in 1980, but oil available for import to the US in 2040 may be quite different from 1980, as exporting countries begin using a greater and greater percentage of their production. In other words, production rates may be as you suggest, but the distribution of that oil may be radically different. Sort of an oil version of “the future has already arrived, it is just not evenly distributed”. <br><br>Consider that the US now produces around 5 mbd, about what was produced in 1950. If the US is increasingly forced to rely on domestic production as available exportable oil declines, our situation will be complicated by our advanced state of depletion. Since our utilization is presently 17 mbd greater than our ever-declining production, an ever-decreasing supply of oil from exporting counties hurts the US especially hard. An exporting region like FSU, which consumes less than it’s total production, will be in relatively better shape.<br><br><a href=is-history-on-anyones-side.html#c6731252716677321768 title="comment permalink">6/12/07, 10:35 PM</a><br><br>

Dwig, of course social change can happen fast, but the payoff to anybody who is able to keep extracting oil is big enough that I suspect there will be takers until the net energy goes so far into negative territory that it's impossible to ignore. Your suggested rules are great, BTW.<br><br>Bryant, I'd point out that the only reason the US has to import oil is the fantastically wasteful way we use energy. If Americans used the same amount of energy per capita as Europeans, we'd either break even or still have a bit to export -- I've seen varying statistics on this. Westexas' model is very savvy, and it's something countries with no oil production need to worry about, but the US is still one of the world's largest oil producers, and once the economic and political gimmickry that nets us a quarter of the world's energy resources falls apart -- something I expect to see in my lifetime -- my guess is that we'll figure out how to get by on the still substantial energy resources we've got left.<br><br><a href=is-history-on-anyones-side.html#c5310662871668848360 title="comment permalink">6/12/07, 11:46 PM</a><br><br>

I find them to be of great value.<br><br>As for the note that if oil production peaks in 2010, then oil production in 2040 will be where it was in 1980, if the depletion curve is Gaussian (which by the way indicates a rapid decline then a slow falloff after the peak). Of course, the population (and thus demand for energy) has increased at least linearly, if not geometrically, over the same time period. Thus we appear to have a constant increase in demand simultaneous with a decrease in supply. If the depletion curve is indeed Gaussian (and not Gaussian with a longish plateau for a "peak"), then we need to look at the amount of oil available for export to the US, i.e. the rise in population and demand for Middle East (and Far East - Indonesian) oil versus the available supply of oil reserves waiting to be pumped out of the ground.<br><br>We also need to consider what kinds of oil are available: light, sweet crude from Al Ghawar is likely to be 45 to 50% gasoline, 20% lighter fractions, with low to no sulfur content whereas Venezuelan crude oil has maybe 10% gasoline with relatively high sulfur content. btw, a barrel of oil has 42 US gallons. If 10% of that is gasoline, then a barrel of heavy sour Venezuelan crude might get refined (fractionally distilled) into (say) 4 gallons of gasoline. At $100/barrel, the gasoline might end up costing $10 to $15/gallon, wholesale, assuming the other fractions are salable.<br><br>So we really need to look at oil production versus the population-driven demand for energy.<br><br>by the way, I'm going to look up your snail mail address and send you a letter if this doesn't work again. It's taken me 15 minutes of trying and after this, I'm giving up...<br><br><a href=is-history-on-anyones-side.html#c6349410605413604770 title="comment permalink">9/3/07, 10:37 AM</a><br><br>
