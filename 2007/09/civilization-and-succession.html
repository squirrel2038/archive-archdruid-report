In an <span style="font-style: italic"> Archdruid Report</span> post a couple of weeks ago, I used the well-worn metaphor of bacteria in a petri dish to talk about the way that ecological limits constrain the range of possibilities open to any life form, Homo sapiens included. Several people objected to the comparison, insisting basically that human beings are enough smarter than microbes that the same rules don’t apply. Flattering to human vanity as this insistence may be, I have to admit to a certain skepticism about the claim in the light of current events. <br><br>According to the best current figures, world production of petroleum peaked almost two years ago and has been declining ever since; world production of all liquid fuels peaked more than a year ago, and is likewise declining; much of the Third World is already in desperate straits as its access to fossil fuels dries up — and government and business leaders across the industrial world, which has far more to lose from the twilight of cheap abundant energy than the Third World does, are still treating peak oil as a public relations problem. If we’re enough smarter than microbes in a petri dish to escape the same fate, we have yet to demonstrate it.<br><br>On a deeper level, of course, such comments miss the point just as thoroughly as the claim they’re meant to satirize. The value of the petri dish metaphor is that it shows how ecological processes works in a context simple enough to make them clear. The same pattern can be traced in more complex biological systems, human societies among them. The logic of the petri dish, after all, is the same logic that drove dieoff on Easter Island and among the lowland Maya: if you use the resources necessary to your survival at an unsustainable rate, you get the classic overshoot curve — population boom, followed by population bust.<br><br>Thus humanity is no more exempt from ecological processes than from the law of gravity. The invention of airplanes doesn’t mean that gravity no longer affects us; it means that if we use a lot of energy, we can overcome the force of gravity and lift ourselves off the ground for a while. The same principle holds with the laws of ecology. Using an immense amount of energy, we lifted a minority of the world’s population high above the subsistence level for a while, but that doesn’t mean that ecological laws no longer affect us. It means that for three hundred years, we’ve been able to push past the limits normally imposed by those laws, by burning up huge amounts of fossil fuels. When the fossil fuels are gone, the laws will still be there.<br><br>One of the central principles of ecology, in fact, is that similar patterns can be traced among organisms at many different levels of complexity. The difference in intelligence between yeast and deer is many times greater than the difference between deer and human beings, and yet deer and yeast alike go through exactly parallel cycles of boom and bust when resource availability rather than predators functions as the primary means of population control. Thus it’s reasonable to look to ecological patterns among other living things for clues to the driving forces behind equivalent processes in human societies.<br><br>One ecological pattern that deserves especially close attention as we begin the long slide down the back end of Hubbert’s peak is the process called succession. Any of my readers who were unwise enough to buy a home in one of the huge and mostly unsold housing developments cranked out at the top of the late real estate bubble will be learning quite a bit about succession over the next few years, so it may be useful for more than one reason to summarize it here.<br><br>Imagine an area of bare bulldozed soil someplace where the annual rainfall is high enough to support woodland. Long before the forlorn sign saying “Coming Soon Luxury Homes Only $450K” falls to the ground, seeds blown in by the wind send up a first crop of invasive weeds. Those pave the way for other weeds and grasses, which eventually choke out the firstcomers. After a few years, shrubs and pioneer trees begin rising, and become anchor species for a young woodland, which shades out the last of the weeds and the grass. In the shade of the pioneer trees, saplings of other species sprout. If nothing interferes with the process, the abandoned lot can pass through anything up to a dozen different stages before it finally settles down as an old growth forest community a couple of centuries later.<br><br>This is what ecologists call succession. Each step along the way from bare dirt to mature forest is a <span style="font-style: italic">sere </span>or a <span style="font-style: italic">seral stage</span>. The same process shapes the animal population of the vacant lot, as one species after another moves into the area for a time, until it’s supplanted by another better adapted to the changing environment and food supply. It also proceeds underground, as the dizzyingly complex fabric of life that makes up healthy soil reestablishes itself and then cycles through its own changes. Watch a vacant lot in a different ecosystem, and you’ll see it go through its own sequence of seres, ending in its own climax community — that’s the term for the final, relatively stable sere in a mature ecosystem, like the old growth forest in our example. The details change, but the basic pattern remains the same.<br><br>Essential to the pattern is a difference in the way that earlier and later seres deal with energy and other resources. Species common in early seres – R-selected species, in ecologists’ jargon – usually maximize their control over resources and their production of biomass, even at the cost of inefficient use of resources and energy. Weeds are a classic example of R-selected species: they grow fast, spread rapidly, and get choked out when slower-growing plants get established, or the abundant resources that make their fast growth possible run short. Species common in later seres – K-selected species – maximize efficiency in using resources and energy, even when this means accepting limits on biomass production and expansion into available niches. Temperate zone hardwood trees are a classic example of K-selected species: they grow slowly, take years to reach maturity, and endure for centuries when left undisturbed.<br><br>Apply the model of succession to human ecology and a remarkably useful way of looking at the predicament of industrial society emerges. In successional terms, we are in the early stages of the transition between an R-selected sere and the K-selected sere that will replace it. The industrial economies of the present, like any other R-selected sere, maximizes production at the expense of sustainability; the successful economies of the future, emerging in a world without today’s cheap abundant energy, will need to maximize sustainability at the expense of production, like any other K-selected sere.<br><br>To put this into the broader picture it’s necessary to factor in the processes of evolutionary change, because climax communities are stable only from the perspective of a human lifetime. Environmental shifts change them; so, often on a much faster timescale, does the arrival of new species on the scene. Sometimes this latter process makes succession move in reverse for a while. For example, when an invasive sere of R-selected species outcompetes the dominant species of a K-selected climax community; eventually the succession process starts moving forward again, but the new climax community may not look much like the old one.<br><br>Apply this to the human ecology of North America, say, and it’s easy to trace the pattern. A climax community of K-selected Native American horticulturalists and hunter-gatherers was disrupted and largely replaced by an invasive sere of European farmers with a much more R-selected ecology. Not long after the new community established itself, and before succession could push it in the direction of a more K-selected ecology, a second invasive sere – the industrial economy – emerged, using resources the first two seres could not access. This second invasive sere, the first of its kind on the planet, was on the far end of the R-selected spectrum; its ability to access and use extravagant amounts of energy enabled it to dominate the farming sere that preceded it, and push the remnants of the old climax community to the brink of extinction.<br><br>Like all R-selected seres, though, the industrial economy was vulnerable on two fronts. Like all early seres in succession, it faced the risk that a more efficent K-selected sere would eventually outcompete it, and its ability to use resources at unsustainable rates made it vulnerable to disruptive cycles of boom and bust that would sooner or later guarantee that a more efficient sere would replace it. Both those processes are well under way. The industrial economy is well into overshoot at this point, and at this point a crash of some kind is pretty much inevitable. At the same time, the more efficient K-selected human ecologies of the future have been sending up visible shoots since the 1970s, in the form of a rapidly spreading network of small organic farms, local farmer’s markets, appropriate technology, and alternative ways of thinking about the world, among many other things.<br><br>Three points deserve to be made in this context. First, one of the differences between human beings and other organisms is that human ecologies are culturally rather than biologically determined; the same individuals are at least potentially able to shift from an R-selected to a K-selected human ecology by changing their means of subsistence. Since it’s unlikely that a K-selected human ecology can or will be expanded fast enough to take up the slack of the disintegrating R-selected industrial system, there’s still likely to be a great deal of human suffering and disruption over the next century or so. Still, those individuals willing to make the transition to a K-selected lifestyle sooner rather than later may find that the disintegration of the industrial system opens up opportunities to survive and even flourish.<br><br>The second point circles back to the subject of last week’s <span style="font-style: italic">Archdruid Report</span> post, Fermi’s paradox. The assumption at the core of the paradox, as mentioned in that post, is that today’s extravagantly energy-wasting system is the wave of the future, and more advanced civilizations than ours will have even more energy and use it even more lavishly. The concept of succession suggests a radically different view of what an advanced civilization might look like. Modern industrial society here on Earth is the exact equivalent of the first sere of pioneer weeds on the vacant lot described above – fast-growing, resource-hungry, inefficient, and destined to be supplanted by more efficient K-selected seres as the process of succession unfolds. <br><br>A truly advanced civilization, here or elsewhere, might well have more in common with a climax community: it might use very modest amounts of energy and resources with high efficiency, maximize sustainability, and build for the long term. Such a civilization would be very hard to detect across interstellar distances, and the limits to the energy resources available to it make it vanishingly unlikely that it would attempt to cross those distances; this would hardly make it a failure as a civilization, except in the eyes of those for whom the industrial-age fantasies of science fiction trump all other concerns.<br><br>The third point leads into issues that will be central to a great many future posts on this blog. The climax community that emerges after a period of prolonged ecological disruption and the arrival of new biotic assemblages rarely has much in common with the climax community that prevailed before the disruptions began. In the same way, and for most of the same reasons, claims that the deindustrial world will necessarily end up as an exact equivalent of some past society – be that medieval feudalism, tribal hunter-gatherer cultures, or anything else – need to be taken with more than the usual grain of salt. Much of the heritage of today’s industrial societies will likely prove unsustainable in the future ahead of us, but not all; some technologies of the present and recent past could easily continue to play important roles in the human ecologies of the deindustrial future, and many more can help cushion the descent. Tracing out some of the options can help guide today’s choices at a time when constructive action is desperately needed.

In some ways, deer and yeast are much closer to each other than to homo sapiens -- language, self-awareness, ability to form a variety of social orders, ... Unfortunately, it seems that our yeast-like nature has dominated our sapient potential up 'til now. The good news is, we've never had such a broad and deep understanding of the way the world works as that which has emerged fairly recently, and we have to hope that that knowledge, together with a K-phase-oriented way of seeing, will serve us well.<br><br>(Aside: as is all too common, I sometimes tend to use the first person plural pronoun loosely, and I have to periodically ask myself : "who's we?". In the case of the last sentence in the above paragraph, I think I mean something like "enough of us to make a positive difference in the outcome".)<br><br>In a nice bit of synchronicity, I reread yesterday a 1993 article by Peter Hartley, "<a href=http://dieoff.org/page74.htm rel=nofollow>SUSTAINABLE ENGINEERING: Resource Load Carrying Capacity and K­phase Technology</a>". I'd been thinking of it for a while after reading it many years ago on Jay Hanson's Dieoff site, and decided to refresh my memory. I think it's an excellent companion piece to this post of yours.<br><br>With regard to <i>The climax community that emerges after a period of prolonged ecological disruption and the arrival of new biotic assemblages rarely has much in common with the climax community that prevailed before the disruptions began.</i>:<br><br>Of course, you're taking a bit of understandable liberty with the successional model, applying it to a situation that's hybrid of biological and cultural ecological considerations in the evolutionary and ecological dimensions (playing a bit loose with terminology myself here...). Looking at it like this, it's not clear to me that homo sapiens has ever produced a climax community. (I definitely don't subscribe to the "everything was fine until we invented X" theories.) That may be one reason that there are so many possible outcomes, ranging from the typical post-overshoot degraded conditions depicted in Hartley's Figure 11, to something like an ecotopia; while the r-K model is definitely useful for clarifying our current situation, it's less so for predicting how the succession will play out.<br><br>Finally, I'm guessing that in a future post, you'll examine the relationships between the r-K model and your catabolic collapse model; looking forward to reading it!<br><br><a href=civilization-and-succession.html#c6590483425038120630 title="comment permalink">9/26/07, 8:16 PM</a><br><br>

Long before the forlorn sign saying “Coming Soon Luxury Homes Only $450K” falls to the ground, seeds blown in by the wind send up a first crop of invasive weeds.</i><br><br>This made me laugh. I don't have to imagine it. Here in my little Northwest milltown/railyard we have exactly such a development. Three years ago "Grand Prairie" was the name of a small (1 sq mile or so) upland that was naturally lacking in the pervasive Douglas Fir of the Northwest. Due to an unusually deep water table and the long summer droughts of the area, it is not conducive to softwood growth. Instead it is a very sparse (a few trees per acre) oak woodland. Ideal goat country, or good for field and row cropping if enough water can be obtained.<br><br>Now "Grand Prairie" is a housing development featuring "Homes in the to $300,000's". The developer bought 60 acres, close enough to town to make a sewer line feasible, and bribed, excused me, "lobbied" the county government for a zoning change from Agricultural to Residential. 3,000 square foot homes on 5,000 square foot lots, with all the amenities. With prices so low compared to similar houses in Seattle and Portland, how could they lose?<br><br>A Small Problem has cropped up, however. My little town is 70 miles from Portland, 120 Miles from Seattle. No-one working locally can afford a $340,000 home. Especially when a nice home on a large lot in a real town such as Centralia costs on the order of $140,000. <br><br>When the project was planned, gasoline was $1.89/gallon. The idea was that people living in the development would be working in a larger city 40, 70, or 100 miles away, in order to be able to afford a much nicer home than they could in those places.<br><br>Now with gasoline at almost $3 and creeping up a few cents every week, there are no takers. The three model homes sit forlornly in their postage stamp lots beside the streets to nowhere in particular. <br><br>They have actually seeded the ground to a lawn type grass, and they keep it mowed so far. Eventually the money will run out. When that happens, the very nice but poorly built homes will be sold at 30-50 cents on the dollar and somebody may even move in to them. The other lots will sell indvidually, without the covenants that seem to appeal to the anal-retentive types that want these houses seem to like. They will be in short order occupied by mobile homes (half the price for essentially the same house). <br><br>I give it 3 more years, less if the economy goes the way I think it might before the end of Bush's term.<br><br>You described the situation exactly. Well done sir!<br><br><a href=civilization-and-succession.html#c7267204022278251046 title="comment permalink">9/26/07, 8:51 PM</a><br><br>

When the fuel is gone beyond our reach, we are pretty much going to have to live out our lives where we sit, with pretty much what we have. Geography is vital, and it will be a matter of life and death even more than it is now. And under such circumstances, as essayists like Dmitri Orlov and Joseph Tainter (and yourself, JMG) effectively demonstrate, collapse will engender situations where we are almost certainly to be compelled to get to know our neighbors intimately-- like it or not. It may be better to begin to lay the groundwork for these relationships early. This might begin at a homeowners' association or neighborhood group, or a coop or buying club. (Or even a blog.)Garden and farming clubs are the wave of our future sere, in my view. As in permaculture or in climax habitat types, successful human succession will require a mutual support system, one this country (the U.S.) must relearn.<br><br><a href=civilization-and-succession.html#c7801989211136639174 title="comment permalink">9/26/07, 10:26 PM</a><br><br>

I may even be more pessimistic than you, however, not all current societies, even advanced one, fall into that category.<br><br>Where our views differ greatly, is that unlike you, I believe we arrived where we are mostly by historical accident. We could have just as easily arrived somewhere less toxic, in fact some parts of the world did.<br><br>Likewise, civilizations on other planets would have a wide range of possible societies and outcomes available to them. Some would do very much better than we are at the moment.<br><br>And of course, we also disagree strongly on the practicality and cost of setting up off-world populations and production facilities.<br><br>I think there is good evidence that once a civilization is able to produce machines able to move and carry out basic tasks on their own (which we are very close to, thanks to military financed research) the costs become minor, even to a climax K-selected civilization as only seed stock of a few hundred tonnes (much less for really advanced technology) of machines have to be sent. They then replicate and send stuff back to the mother world.<br><br>I mention this again because it has a huge bearing on just what a final (if anything ever is final) K-selected civilization would be like: The stage technology reached in the preceding R-selected culture (assuming the same path as we are taking) to a large extent determines what the climax culture will be like.<br><br>This is because, after a certain point, technology becomes easier, perhaps progressively easier. We seem to have just passed that tipping point now, where better, more versatile machines make factories cheaper, more versatile and energy efficient and even horrendously difficult processes such a chip making are starting to simplify.<br><br>If a civilization/culture manages to get well passed that point before expending its original fossil fuel resources and the subsequent “Long Emergency” is not too disruptive, the final culture will be quite hi-tech in a simplified sort of way and science and technology will continues to advance to an unknown destination. Better yet, if the technology is sufficient to send out the machine core of self-replicating, off-world manufacturing systems, then the long term outlook is quite bright, even if everyone decides to stay on the home world.<br><br>If, however, it never passes that tipping point, or the collapse is so disruptive that the advanced technology is lost, the outlook is a lot bleaker.<br><br>Another thing we have not much discussed is population. If a civilization’s population is already bumping along its Malthusian limit before its Peak Everything moment, things are not going to be nice. If, however, the population is well under carrying capacity, an orderly and dignified change to a sustainable state should not be too hard to organize.<br><br>Another thing I agree with is the final point that “claims that the deindustrial world will necessarily end up as an exact equivalent of some past society – be that medieval feudalism, tribal hunter-gatherer cultures, or anything else – need to be taken with more than the usual grain of salt”.<br><br>I think that is dead on: Whatever we finish up with, it is likely to be rather different from the major cultures in our recent past.

I think Mr. Greer touches on a salient fact that may work against us.<br><br><i>First, one of the differences between human beings and other organisms is that human ecologies are culturally rather than biologically determined; the same individuals are at least potentially able to shift from an R-selected to a K-selected human ecology by changing their means of subsistence. Since it’s unlikely that a K-selected human ecology can or will be expanded fast enough to take up the slack of the disintegrating R-selected industrial system, there’s still likely to be a great deal of human suffering and disruption over the next century or so. Still, those individuals willing to make the transition to a K-selected lifestyle sooner rather than later may find that the disintegration of the industrial system opens up opportunities to survive and even flourish.</i><br><br>This ability to consciously change may work against us. Imagine a field filled with weeds that has ovrshot the ability of the field to supply the nutrients needed to support the weed population. But these are special weeds - they can, through conscious will, choose to transform into a hard wood tree. If a few of them do this then the new seer will be propogated and the weeds will die off in the shade of the trees. <br><br>But these weeds aren't dumb. All of them will eventually realize their predicament and all of them will see that a possible solution is to transform into a hard wood tree. Sure the process will work when some small percentage of the weeds change into hardwood trees. But what happens when a large percentage of weeds try changing? Suddenly there is no room and not enough resources to support hard wood trees either!<br><br>There will be a massive die off. And from our point of view it will look very unfair. Weeds will die in mass and so will nascient hard wood trees.<br><br><a href=civilization-and-succession.html#c1125858764923876459 title="comment permalink">9/27/07, 9:49 AM</a><br><br>

But then again, Many of my college credits came from biology and ecosystem studies.<br><br>You and I only disagree here in the degree of dislocation. I believe that we are so far into overshoot that we are going to experience some very hard corrections. I don't believe that the Earth can support a billion people without huge supplies of energy. We don't live on the same kind of planet our ancestors lived on. We don't have the abundance of topsoil, game, fish, and water that we once enjoyed. Without cheap energy, I fear that dropping water tables will turn much of the midwest in the US into desert. Continued climate change will dry up rivers dependant on snow melt. <br><br>Without cheap water, agriculture is very difficult.<br><br>Philip, humans are one species, but we differentiate in how we earn a living. This is essentially what separates species in nature, into different niches. Different birds for instance live on different diets. Some species live nectar, others seeds and grains, grass, insects, fish, other birds, mammals and reptiles, carrion...<br><br>Humans in a society tend to have jobs and skills that fill a niche. an individual may have one or more skills that supports that person in the society. So each person fills a niche.<br><br>Joel, as to fewer resources, it is a quantitative thing. When adding up the BTUs, our oil based society has thousands of times the resources available per person than a native American had a few hundred years ago.

Thanks, all, for your comments!<br><br>Creekholme, I'm a fan of Sharon's also -- she's one of the few people offering sound practical advice about the deindustrial transition. <br><br>Joel, compare the amount of available energy in food form in 1491 with the amount available when the first Native Americans arrived here -- when the megafauna were still around and the Clovis people could eat for a couple of weeks off one mammoth -- and you have the difference between a pioneer sere and a climax sere. A deciduous tree has plenty of water and sunlight, but nutrient levels in the soil of an old growth forest are usually pretty low -- it's all been taken up into the biomass, and cycles fairly slowly. <br><br>Michael, there badly needs to be a good book on ecological science for the layperson, and I don't yet know of one. The closest equivalent -- and an excellent book on the end of industrial society -- is William Catton's <i>Overshoot</i>, which has a good introduction to succession and some other ecological ideas. Other than that, see if you can find a used copy of Eugene Odum's absolutely classic textbook <i>Fundamentals of Ecology</i> -- it's a bit heavy going if you haven't had any biology classes in a while, but it deserves its name. <br><br>Farfetched, great metaphor!<br><br>Dwig, a climax community isn't a Utopia -- it's simply a stable ecological arrangement that can endure for a very long time without more than incidental changes. The New Guinea highland cultures are a great example of a human climax community: they've been using the same mix of hunting, gathering and mixed-crop agriculture there for something better than 10,000 years by current estimates. <br><br>As for the interaction between R- and K-selected cultures and catabolic collapse, I actually discussed a bit of that in the original catabolic collapse paper, where I proposed that collapse is a succession process. I may say more about it one of these days. <br><br>Danby, we've got 'em here in Ashland as well -- two big new neighborhoods with not a soul living in them. They broke ground just after the local housing market topped out, and things are in freefall right now -- prices of new homes here are down 35% over this time last year, and expected to drop further. So it wasn't a huge leap of the imagination!<br><br>Luke, I certainly didn't mean to suggest that things will enter a static state after the breakdown of the current industrial order! Quite the contrary, we're in for a torrent of change extending over a time scale of centuries. If there's a stable climax community in the future, it's a very, very long ways off. <br><br>Hulot, I'd say "neighbors" rather than "villagers," because not all of us will be living in villages. No doubt the neoprimitive zealots will go on another denunciatory tear if I repeat this, but cities -- especially small and mid-sized cities in agricultural regions -- are going to be perfectly viable in the deindustrial world, just as they were in the preindustrial world. Still, with that correction your point stands; the community, not the individual, is the basic unit of human survival, and if we don't have communities to hand right now we are going to have to build them. <br><br>Loveandlight, no argument there -- you're not going to see many Druids cheering on a war against nature! What we can hope and build for, as I see it, is a world of the future in which appropriate technology and ecologically sensible subsistence strategies allow people to live in harmony with the rest of the biosphere, without having to scrap all the achievements of the last 300 years. <br><br>Philip, of course there's a difference between succession in a woodland and succession in human cultures. My point is that we can see, in the history of our species, parallel processes at work and use those to make sense of our current situation. <br><br>Stephen, I'd suggest instead that technological progress, like everything else, suffers from the law of diminishing returns. Still, not much point in rehashing a disagreement we've already covered in detail. In the present case, certainly, the Star Trek future imagined by so many people isn't going to happen, and the question then becomes what forms of technology it's useful and appropriate for us to preserve. <br><br>Anthony, good -- one of the reasons why the weeds who try to turn into hardwoods won't make it is that you can't skip seral stages. The hardwood trees depend on nutrients and soil conditions produced by the previous, pioneer tree sere, which depends on the results of the sere before it, and so on. In the same way, attempts to leap from a dying industrial system straight to a steady-state K-selected society will likely fail. What we need to be considering instead is the next sere -- what I call the salvage society, which uses the detritus of industrial society as the basis for its technology and bases its subsistence strategy on ecological restoration. More on this later. <br><br>Weaseldog, I did a lot of ecology and botany in my first stint in college, too -- I seriously considered an academic career focusing on the ecology of mosses and ferns. As for our points of disagreement, no, I think we're in agreement as to the amount of dislocation -- where we differ, I think, is the time scale. I expect a gradual unraveling over one to three centuries leading into a deindustrial dark age and, eventually, out the other side into the sustainable civilizations of the future; in that scenario, most of the population contraction (which will be extreme -- I expect around 90%) will happen via normal demographic changes rather than the kind of mass dieoff predicted by so many scenarios these days. But the problems you've suggested are very much part of my scenario.<br><br><a href=civilization-and-succession.html#c2356411003967059408 title="comment permalink">9/27/07, 12:44 PM</a><br><br>

If I get it right, your bet is that the coming civilization(s) will be able to find the best possible arrangement with the environment...eventually, this last word being the key one. <br><br>However, we have seen historically that most human cultures have never behaved as K-selected species. Instead, intelligence has always allowed us to find the most agressive strategy to grab resouces, and deplete them all. Industrial civilization is the ultimate example, but the extinction of ancient American megafauna comes to mind, and so does the burning away of prehistoric Australia until aboriginals turned the continent into the desert it mostly is today.<br> Easter islanders chopped away those trees and they never came back. Carthage used to be the wheat warehouse of Europe, now it is not much but desert. Looks like people rarely found a balance, and kept ravaging the environment to the verge of self-extinction.<br><br>I totally agree your claim that the future never totally reproduces the past, which makes the next century the most intriguing in all human history; however, it is hard not to anticipate that humans will grab to the current model for as long as they can, tooth and nail, perhaps until they chop, eat, burn and deplete any available resource. There is not much fertile soil left, for example, and once it is gone, it is gone for good (see Gobi and, again, Australia).<br>And then, when most books have turned into dust and all hard-disks remain silent, What will be left? Even if someone in some area manages to produce a, lets call it, a k-selected culture, sooner or later it will be smashed by the first of our descendants smart enough as to pick a stone and throw it. That has been the pattern for millenia: Persians ravaging Mesopotamia, Aztecs over their civilized southern neighbours, Christian warriors against sophisticated Al-Andalus muslims, Europeans over native Americans, and so on and on.

I highly recommend that anyone interested in delving into this theme more deeply revisit "The Tragedy of the Commons," Garrett Hardin, Science, 162(1968):1243-1248. <br><br>Regardless of whether a species is playing out an r-selected strategy, a K-selected strategy, or somewhere in between, at the point of consumption, the individual consumer has a finite set of resources from which to consume. Humans seem to have set up a scenario in which they have trusted that technological innovations will maintain or increase a resource base for a burgeoning population that has grown from a billion a scant 200 years to ago to 6.5 billion today. <br><br>We claim success in our efforts to expand or increase resources by selective breeding and genetic modification of crops essential to the food system and by conversion of land to agricultural use by extracting water from distant sources. My confidence in the promise of the human capacity to continually modify our surroundings to support an increasing population erodes when we consider that we need to use non-renewable and dwindling resources to 'run' the technology. <br><br> We've latched on to the promise of biofuels. I see little value and considerable threat in taking limited land out of production for the food system and putting it into transportation. Further, most of the biofuels considered are far, far from carbon neutral. <br><br>A petri dish containing organisms is at some point in time and space a closed system with growth constrained by resource limitation. E. O. Wilson elegantly describes the biosphere as a 'layer of life on earth so thin that it can not be seen from space' - a humbling image when we try to argue for our ability to create resources out of thin air!<br><br><a href=civilization-and-succession.html#c995742560301303910 title="comment permalink">9/28/07, 10:15 AM</a><br><br>

And of course I cringe again when they are used as analogies for human societies. But bear with me, we'll get back on the same page before the end of this comment. <br><br>Simple notions of succession and population dynamics like "climax communities" and "R/K specialization" are firmly entrenched in the popular ecological mindset. They are rooted ancient notions of the balance of nature, equilibrium, and harmony of the natural world that date back (in formalized Western scholarship) deep into the middle ages. In fact, the Pristine Climax Community probably has a direct lineage back to the Garden of Eden in the Western mind. However, ecology as a science (rather than a worldview or the basis of a political movement) moved away from notions of climax, equilibrium, and steady-state decades ago. As the late Dick Wiegert put it, for a living system equilibrium means death. Ecology now deals with a world where change is universal and incessant, variation is infinite, and every square meter is, like a snowflake, unique in a vastly hyperdimensional ecospace that incorporates the present, the past, and a huge array of exogenous and endogenous forces and processes that are constantly changing the ecological state of every point on earth. Instead of Climax-Disturbance-Succession-Climax, proceeding in orderly fashion like the growth and metamorphosis of a Superorganism, we have wiggly lines superimposed on each other, with slow changes, fast changes, interacting shifts, irreversible plunges over catastrophic boundaries, nothing ever the same twice. The reason our collective scientific thinking evolved in this direction is that this is what our data always show. Plot ANY ecological variable over time or space, and you see both pattern AND infinite variation which never repeats exactly. <br><br>Which brings me back to your analogy. Indeed, a parallel intellectual evolution has been happening during the same decades in fields like sociology and anthropology. Victorian notions of cultures, societies, languages, and historical periods as discrete, cleanly-defined entities have been defenestrated, one and all. Human societies consist of a vast collection of entities and elements, which evolve and flow endlessly across the exceedingly permeable boundaries between "cultures." This is true both over time and over space. There will never be another "Dark Age" for two reasons: The world is a vastly different place now in every way, and the original "Dark Age" was a concept imposed on an arbitrary period in history based on a very particular and narrow view of what is important within society and humanity. <br><br>So, indeed, the ecological analogy is in fact an apt one. What comes "next" will be something unique that springs out of all that has come before and everything that happens in the coming decades and centuries. It will have many bits that are recognizable as similar to things that have come before; but it will be a world unlike any that as been seen before just as the present is unique and, <i>in toto</i>, unlike any moment in the past.<br><br><a href=civilization-and-succession.html#c2408272563914583496 title="comment permalink">9/28/07, 12:59 PM</a><br><br>

If somebody threw a rock at them, they threw it back with twice the force -- it took the white invaders, with their huge numerical and technological superiority, a long and extremely bitter war to finally conquer them. So I don't think it's safe to assume that a more K-selected human society is more vulnerable to violence than a more R-selected one. <br><br>Jean-Michel, I'm quite familiar with the global warming data, and in fact we have been here before. Around 9600 BCE, at the end of the last ice age, global temperature as measured by Greenland ice core samples, went up between 13 and 15 degrees Fahrenheit in less than a decade -- runaway warming by any measure. The result was catastrophic glacial melting, the collapse of the Laurentide and Scandinavian ice sheets, and the flooding of something like 10% of the world's habitable land surface. Our species came through the experience in fine shape, and so did the rest of the planet. <br><br>One of the points that's been made by peak oil analysts is that the IPCC projections for global warming over the next century assume that the rate of fossil fuel use will keep rising indefinitely; apparently nobody thought to ask whether there's enough oil, coal, and natural gas to keep up with demand. <br><br>Mind you, that doesn't mean global warming isn't an issue. I expect to see the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets break apart in my lifetime, which means sea levels will rise around 50 feet and a lot of today's coastal real estate will be full fathom five. It does mean that, as usual, apocalyptic visions of total catastrophe need to be tempered with a recognition of the fact that worst case scenarios not supported by historic (or prehistoric) data aren't a good basis for planning. <br><br>Anthony, you'll be seeing a lot about it over the next few months. Stay tuned. <br><br>Dragonfly, a good summary of the point of the last few weeks of posts. Many thanks. <br><br>Bill, as a student of the history of ideas I've long watched the pendulum that moves back and forth in every science. You get periods where conceptual clarity is valued over resolution of fine detail, and periods where the reverse is true. The transition around 1980 saw a lot of clear but oversimplified concepts drop out of fashion in favor of views so nuanced that it's sometimes hard to tell if anything's being said at all. My guess is that in another couple of decades, refined versions of succession theory and the like will be back in style, because despite their flaws they do represent processes that can be observed in action as an ecosystem deals with disturbance. <br><br>Of course you're right that seres and climax communities are abstract labels used to make sense of a much more complex, textured, nuanced reality on the ground. Still, I'd suggest that the labels clarify a good deal more than they falsify, so long as it's remembered that seres and climax communities are snapshot views of a flowing process of change -- and they also have the advantage of making some of the more common processes of ecological change understandable by people who don't have a degree in any of the environmental sciences. That seems extremely valuable to me just now. <br><br>Your example of the label "Dark Ages" is a useful one. Of course the label "Dark Ages" was applied to the period between the fall of Rome and the defeat of the last Norse invasions by a later period for reasons not uninfested with prejudice. It's still a convenient label for a general kind of historical reality, and can be used to compare the aftermaths of imperial ages with one another. <br><br>Yes, there are major differences between the period of chaos that followed the fall of Rome with the ones that followed the fall of the Han dynasty in China, the Hittite empire in Anatolia, the Teotihuacan empire in Mexico, etc., etc., -- but there are also similarities that deserve attention, not least because they allow us to anticipate at least some features that might be expected to crop up after the fall of the American empire, say. <br><br>The term "Dark Ages" has another point in its favor, which is that it does actually reflect an important dimension of the lived experience of the time. I've read a good deal of Dark Age European literature, some of it in the original languages, and one thing that comes through a great deal of it is a profound sense of loss and of the harshness of life in a bitter, violent time. An age of drastic population decline, social and political chaos, barbarian invasions, and the loss of priceless cultural treasures -- and all these things were constant realities during the Dark Ages -- is unlike an age of relative stability and peace in important ways, and it's crucial, it seems to me, not to allow a fixation on differences of detail to lose sight of that overarching fact. The fact that a generalization is broad, and does not necessarily reflect every detail, does not make it useless. <br><br>Deadbeat, if you don't salvage or practice some form of medicine, you're going to lose the struggle for survival in favor of those who do. As it happens, I know how to swing a (Chinese) broadsword -- it's one of the weapons used in the martial art I practice -- but I'm also not half bad with a 12-gauge shotgun, not least because the latter is a more efficient way of putting venison on the table. <br><br>As for medicine, nowadays modern industrial medicine has become the leading cause of death in the United States -- add up the annual death toll from nosocomial (hospital-borne) infections, iatrogenic (doctor-caused) illnesses, surgical errors, and prescription medicine side effects, errors, and inappropriate combinations of drugs, and the number you get is higher than the annual tool from heart disease, cancer, accidents, or anything else. The rise of antibiotic resistant microbes, stripping modern medicine of one of its few unquestioned triumphs, is the icing on the cake. <br><br>Mind you, basic sanitation, wound care, and infection control are easy enough to do even in a low tech environment, and will make a big difference if they can be preserved. But given a choice between eye of newt and toxic pharmaceuticals administered in an American hospital where the walls are permeated with methicillin resistant S. aureus and the nurses can't be bothered to wash their hands between patients, I'd take the eye of newt any time.<br><br><a href=civilization-and-succession.html#c6939528805444418748 title="comment permalink">9/28/07, 1:55 PM</a><br><br>

If you dream of a return to the Garden, you see eternal stable climax communities as the underpinning of ecosystems. If you have a GIS in front of you, you see infinite spatial complexity rendered in vivid color.

But it is done with an implicit understanding of them as generalizations and broad vague-ish approximations within which resides all the intricacy that makes up the real world. The cringe happens when you hear these terms in "lay" use; people have a strong tendency to mistake useful generalizations for "natural laws." Likewise, sociologically, people have a dangerous tendency to make "laws" out of much less rigid and deterministic patterns -- all women are bad at math, all americans are violent gun-toters, the fall of Rome lead to a complete collapse of everything of value in the Western world, etc.<br><br><a href=civilization-and-succession.html#c1246799138232451733 title="comment permalink">9/28/07, 2:53 PM</a><br><br>

Yes, Sharon does have a vast knowledge of "old timey" subsistence living.<br><br>I really like your analogy of forest succession. Did you know,that Michigan's forest is larger than it has likely ever been? This is scientific fact. It contains more boardfoot of fiber now, than at anytime ever recorded. Put another way, this forest is much larger and older, than when visited by the first Europeans. You might find this very hard to believe, as does most everyone else.<br><br>You see John, we've become very proficient at putting out fire. Before european settlement, natural succession went pretty much undisturbed. Unlike your bulldozed lot, this natural succession usually was started by a lightening stike. Hugh wildfires would sweep through entire regions, and the cycle would begin again. As you suggested, sometimes a whole new enviroment,(such as a cedar stand)would develop that would support species, best suited to that enviroment.<br><br>However, in order for that to happen, this new enviroment to be utilized, must'nt be too "isolated",(here we go again, eh John?). That is, the distance between the two alike enviroments must be obtinable, within reach, by these spieces to impregnate it.<br><br>An example of this might be the sharptailed grouse. It was never a native bird of Michigan, until the vast logging of the lands of Wisconsin and Minnesota, formed a bridge to the stable enviroment out west, where this bird is native.<br><br>Furthermore, once the distance of like enviroments cannot be breached, become isolated, the extinction process begins for those speices that cannot adapt.<br><br>Back to the sharp-tailed grouse, this spieces is facing extinction today here in Michgan because the distance between like enviroments are to great. There is no bridge.<br><br>Yes John,(as you know) I find what you said,"to look to ecological patterns among other living things for clues to the driving forces behind equivalent process in human societies", very agreeable.<br><br>Am I suggesting that the human industrail societies will end like the sharp-tailed grouse in Michigan? Absolutely! There can be no other way.

I suspect that a good deal of the current discomfort with applying ecological ideas to human beings comes from that. <br><br>Of course you're quite correct that generalizations always reflect the viewpoint of the generalizer, but then one implication of the systems thinking that underlies ecology is that there is no such thing as an objective viewpoint. Yes, each period of analysis lends richness to the subsequent period of synthesis, but if you glance back at Odum's work, say, you'll find that he had quite a strong sense of the rough fit of ecological concepts to realities on the ground; in the book on ecology I referenced earlier, for example, whenever he speaks of the laws of ecology he puts the word in quotation marks. <br><br>Yooper, there are more raccoons in the greater Seattle area today than there were before the first white people arrived. Ecosystems adapt, sometimes aggressively so. <br><br>Deadbeat, I don't despise antibiotics either -- they saved my life in childhood. My point is that they're failing as microbes become resistant to them, and won't be available to future generations. <br><br>Jean-Michel, for heaven's sake take a deep breath. If you can't see the difference between a moderate view of climate change and the complete rejection of the concept -- that is, between "climate change isn't the end of the world" and "climate change isn't a problem at all" -- you may be too deeply mired in apocalyptic mythology to see clearly. <br><br>It's entirely reasonable to compare what happened in 9600 BCE to the present situation; that temperature spike was caused by massive methane releases -- as you're probably aware, methane is a much more effective greenhouse gas than CO2, but the difference in quantities balances that out. Of course there are differences, but the value of the example is that the temperature spike of 9600 BCE was much more extreme than anything plausible estimates (even the extreme IPCC cases) suggest we face today, and it wasn't the end of the world. Neither will this round be. <br><br>I'm offering clear historic and prehistoric equivalents to the present situation. If you want to dismiss those on the grounds that they don't fit your apocalyptic beliefs, that's fine, but I don't find those beliefs any more convincing than any of the dozens of other apocalypses on the market today, and I will continue to suggest that using comparable events in the past to make sense of our probable future is a wiser choice. <br><br>Yooper, electricity isn't an energy resource, it's a mode of energy transmission. You can make a mode of transmission as concentrated as you want to, provided you're willing to pay the energy cost to concentrate it. The concentration of resources is another matter. As for the other stuff, well, I'll take a look at it when it appears.<br><br><a href=civilization-and-succession.html#c2923118859469451567 title="comment permalink">9/28/07, 10:49 PM</a><br><br>

Humans do best in village-sized groups; we'll need to recover the sense of trust in community which enables villages to survive and prosper, rather than placing our trust exclusively in money. We'll learn to trade goods and labor. So long as our word is good as gold, it'll be more valuable than gold to us. It is only the estrangement of people in a large city, (and not necessarily the number of ["extra"?] people), that increases the chance of disorder. The experiences of postwar Europe, and for that matter 21st century Buenos Aires, suggest that a people can thrive even in severely reduced economic circumstances, so long as food and a willingness to work together are available. I'd grant that these last might not be there for us.<br><br>At present, many need not live near work or friends. Soon we will learn to make friends of those nearest to us, or do without. We need to find work within mass transit or walking distance, or gradually we'll find our transport costs are pricing us out of livelihoods. This is essentially living a village life, the practical result of localization. Many neighborhoods in the urban East function basically as villages without local farmland, although evidently NYC did raise half its food during WWII. I am unwilling to write off into the "unavoidable dieoff" column everyone who lives in a city over 60,000 in population. A city of 600,000 can be envisioned as a web of 2000 villages. Without this or a similar vision of community, we'll be lucky if we survive in hamlets.<br><br><a href=civilization-and-succession.html#c5386889302329629302 title="comment permalink">9/29/07, 8:32 AM</a><br><br>

As for the emergence of sustainable societies, I don't expect that for one to three centuries yet. We have a long way to go before succession reaches that point. <br><br>Jean-Michel, repeating over and over again that "it hasn't happened before" when the climate change in question parallels scores of well documented prehistoric events isn't going to convince anyone either. That insistence depends on apocalyptic mythology in the same way that my comments depend on history; given a choice between the two, I'll take history, thank you. <br><br>Of course the arrival of peak oil and climate change in the same time scale isn't a coincidence; they're driven by the same process -- extravagant overuse of fossil fuels -- and the authors of <i>The Limits to Growth</i> predicted on that basis back in 1972 that resource exhaustion (of which peak oil is an example) and environmental disruption due to pollution (of which global warming is an example) would hit around the same time. <br><br>But I don't think we're going to reach any agreement over these points, so probably best to let it drop. <br><br>Bill, the Reagan era may have been a passing thing but we haven't seen much of the visionary human ecology of the New Alchemists, <i>Rainbook</i>, or Ernest Callenbach's <i>Ecotopia</i> since then. Of course the end of the 70s energy crises, which provided much of the impetus to the appropriate technology movement of that decade, also has a lot to say to it, but I did a fair number of classes at Huxley College of Environmental Studies in Bellingham, WA in the early 80s and I remember the feeling of the walls closing in. <br><br>There's a lot of debate right now on the total amount of fossil carbon that industrial society can access and burn, so I don't have firm numbers. Even the high end of the plausible range, though, is far below the IPCC scenarios. <br><br>Mind you, we're still in hot water; Sharon Astyk's post, which as usual is well worth reading, points out that the carbon we've already dumped into the atmosphere is already driving drastic climate changes. She also points out, though, that changes at least as drastic occurred in the prehistoric past, so we've got some basis for making reasoned plans. <br><br>Hulot, many thanks for the clarification -- this seems spot on to me. <br><br>Yooper, I'm not in the least surprised that northern Michigan is reforesting. There are sections of the Great Plains that once again fit the old definition of "frontier" -- that is, fewer than two non-Native American people per square mile. From Kansas north to North Dakota, ghost towns dot the plains, and much of the old farm belt in New England is forest again. It's only the mythology of progress, in my view, that makes it so hard for people to recognize the spreading signs of America's decline and fall.<br><br><a href=civilization-and-succession.html#c1793252843655009611 title="comment permalink">9/29/07, 10:22 PM</a><br><br>

What emerges on the other side, though, has generally lost some pieces. Rapid climate changes tend to be associated with high rates of extinction. And of course in the long, relatively stable interludes, the surviving pieces, displaced and relocated in the altered climate, reassemble in new combinations, and evolution pumps the diversity and complexity back up. Our current anthropogenic extinction event (which rapid climate change would almost surely intensify) interupts what would have otherwise been one of these long, stable periods. So, geologically speaking, in this period when biodiversity "should" be increasing, it is actually decreasing rapidly. Sure it's not the end of the biosphere, and probably not even unprecedented, but collectively it is a friggin' huge blow that will take geological time scales to recover from.<br><br><a href=civilization-and-succession.html#c9024236057045293586 title="comment permalink">9/30/07, 10:58 AM</a><br><br>

A mature ecosystem is increasingly filled with specialist species. Species that have very strict requirements of diet and habitat. Disruption of the ecosystem can lead to a chain reaction of extinctions. We see this today in the rain forests.<br><br>But a climax ecosystem has evolved to maximize it's use of energy. Every niche that can power life is filled. Almost every scrap of available energy is used.<br><br>In human societies we see similar processes. Energy flows in human societies are controlled by currency. Ultimately currency drives the consumption of energy. Goods and services are all derived from the consumption of energy.<br><br>So human society evolves so that every scrap of currency is absorbed somewhere. This leads to bloated bureaucracies, which evolve to soak up all of the funding available to their niche.<br><br>Many sources put Peak Oil at 2010-2020. Colin Campbell and Jean Laherre both stood by this time frame, but insisted that they do not use political factors in their estimations. I emailed both of them about this in 2000, and they confirmed this. But since, Colin Campbell has said in public that political processes could well bring the peak closer. After all, the peak isn't actually strongly related to total production. It is simply the year of maximum production.<br><br>In 2000, we had a mini-peak. Saudi Arabia started having serious production problems. The North Sea went into decline. Most oil producing nations in the world were post-peak by 2000. The decline in 2001 in my view, helped determine the timing of the market decline that began in March.<br><br>2002-2003 saw a valley in world oil production along with rising oil prices. Saudi Arabia made heavy investments to increase their oil production. Late 2003 saw Saudi Arabia outpacing the decline of much of the rest of the world including Argentina and Venezuela. they were able to keep increasing supply into 2005, but are now in decline again. So far, world oil production has peaked in 2005.<br><br>To get a 2010-2020 figure, we need to find a nation that can overcome the decline of the nation with the biggest oil fields on the planet.<br><br>Short of finding a super giant field and using time travel to start drilling it in the past, there seems to be no nation that can ramp up oil production so high, that it dramatically exceeds the pace of Saudia Arabia's decline.<br><br>Though many folks still insist that 2010-2020 or even 2040-2060 are the likely dates for peak oil, it looks like the race is over and 2005 is the date of the peak.<br><br>Back to civilizations and ecosystems, doesn't it appear that our civilization is facing extinction events?<br><br>We have whole careers being wiped out, and just like in an ecosystem, the parasites, opportunists, scavengers and carrion feeders are thriving. In fact it looks like there are carrion feeders everywhere, feeding on privatization, foreclosures, market collapses, war, natural disasters.<br><br>Our civilization is being ripped apart, and scavengers are gobbling everything up.<br><br>For those that have hoped that we'd get our act together when the decline begins, it looks liek history is repeating itself instead.

In the same way, cultural diversity tends to contract in the last phases of a civilization's history, and expands again in its aftermath. <br><br>Jean-Michel, of course every methodology has limits; the question is simply where those limits fall. You've argued that your claims cannot be assessed by comparing them to close equivalents in the past and present; I argue that they can; given the difference in basic presuppositions, a resolution of the debate isn't possible, except by seeing what happens. For my part, though, I have extreme doubts about anybody's claim -- to borrow your metaphor -- to know what cards Spirit has in its hand, or what play it intends to make next. <br><br>Weaseldog, very good -- a solid use of ecological metaphors. As I see it, though, the cannibalization of existing infrastructure is not only inevitable but adaptive, to use a bit of evolutionary jargon; in the theory of catabolic collapse, it's precisely the attempt to maintain infrastructure (and other forms of capital) that exceeds a society's maintenance budget of resources and energy that pushes it into collapse. The question is simply what capital gets abandoned, and whether it's converted into raw materials or waste.

Hari Seldon has been on my mind for years, as you can probably guess. As for the interface between price and resource availability, remember that money is an abstraction; what really matters is the energy cost of extracting resources, and in an environment of decreasing energy availability that can easily trump purely economic forces. You can have as much money as you care to name on a desert island, say, and still perish miserably if there's no food or water to buy; in the same way, supply and demand can't conjure resources into being if the energy to extract them simply isn't there. <br><br>With regard to future societies, I'd point out that many technologically stagnant societies have remained stable and viable for thousands of years -- a figure which compares very favorably to industrial society's 300-year trajectory toward history's dustbin. That is to say, I don't believe in the myth of progress. My guess is that the great task of the next thousand years or so will have nothing to do with learning new technologies; instead, it will be a matter of resurrecting old ones and learning to do without those that are no longer viable in a world with much less energy.<br><br><a href=civilization-and-succession.html#c6401081080934815174 title="comment permalink">10/3/07, 1:05 AM</a><br><br>

We were in a relatively stable time not long after (evolutionarily speaking) a period of extinction in the late Pleistocene. There's plenty of evidence that we were, up until the 19th Century, in a period of speciation, with many widespread species showing lots of genetic variation across their ranges, and large numbers of closely-related species that appear to have only very recently diverged. It will likely all resume with whatever is left over after anthropogenic degradation and the CO2-enhanced global climate settle down again a few centuries in the future... but there's gonna be thousands more species (just of vertebrates) that probably aren't going to make it through until then.<br><br>As I recall, the glacial maxima are fairly stable, climatologically speaking, as are the interglacials, with rapid change in between. Speciation happens during the maxima as well as the interglacials, as populations isolated by deserts and ice masses differentiate.

Hydrogen (fusion energy) is an excellent energy source, if we we are able to develop the required science and technology.<br>It may very well be that we humans are stupid enough to never develop and deploy nuclear fusion into a (nearly) infinite energy supply - and this is not central to my argument.<br><br>My comment concerns your theory about Fermi's paradox.<br>If I understand you correctly, you suggested that all civilizations everywhere in the galaxy would be so limited by their energy resources that they'd never be able to make the jump to other star systems. But I see a lot of hydrogen around. To me, it seems perfectly plausible that some intelligent life form, somewhere in the galaxy, should be able to master nuclear fission, thus producing enough energy for inter-stellar travel. Of course, a more-intelligent-than-us life form might also come up with far superior energy sources. <br><br>Maybe we should just accept that we don't know everything. For me, the Fermi's paradox remains unsolved.<br><br><a href=civilization-and-succession.html#c904734053371783046 title="comment permalink">10/5/07, 12:53 PM</a><br><br>
