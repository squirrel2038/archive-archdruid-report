The core concept that has to be grasped to make sense of the future looming up before us, it seems to me, is the concept of limits. Central to ecology, and indeed all the sciences, this concept has failed so far to find any wider place in the mindscape of industrial society. The recent real estate bubble is simply another example of our culture’s cult of limitlessness at work, as real estate investors insisted that housing prices were destined to keep on rising forever. Of course those claims proved to be dead wrong, as they always are, but the fact that they keep on being made – it’s been only a few years, after all, since the same rhetoric was disproven just as dramatically in the tech stock bubble of the late 1990s – shows just how allergic most modern people are to the idea that there’s an upper limit to anything.<br><br>It’s this same sort of thinking that drives the common belief that limits on industrial society’s access to energy can be overcome by technological innovations. This claim looks plausible at first glance, since the soaring curve of energy use that defines recent human history can be credited to technological innovations that allowed human societies to get at the huge reserves of fossil fuels stored inside the planet. The seemingly logical corollary is that we can just repeat the process, coming up with innovations that will give us ever increasing supplies of energy forever.<br><br>Most current notions about the future are based on some version of this belief. The problem, and it’s not a small one, is that the belief itself is based on a logical fallacy.<br><br>One way to see how this works – or, more precisely, doesn’t work – is to trace the same process in a setting less loaded with emotions and mythic narratives than the future of industrial society. Imagine for a moment, then, that we’re discussing an experiment involving microbes in a petri dish. The culture medium in the dish contains 5% of a simple sugar that the microbes can eat, and 95% of a more complex sugar they don’t have the right enzymes to metabolize. We put a drop of fluid containing microbes into the dish, close the lid, and watch. Over the next few days, a colony of microbes spreads through the culture medium, feeding on the simple sugar.<br><br>Then a mutation happens, and one microbe starts producing an enzyme that lets it feed on the more abundant complex sugar. Drawing on this new food supply, the mutant microbe and its progeny spread rapidly, outcompeting the original strain, until finally the culture medium is full of mutant microbes. At this point, though, the growth of the microbes is within hailing distance of the limits of the supply of complex sugar. As we watch the microbes through our microscopes, we might begin to wonder whether they can produce a second mutation that will let them continue to thrive. Yet this obvious question misleads, because there is no third sugar in the culture medium for another mutation to exploit.<br><br>The point that has to be grasped here is as crucial as it is easy to miss. The mutation gave the microbes access to an existing supply of highly concentrated food; it didn’t create the food out of thin air. If the complex sugar hadn’t existed, the mutation would have yielded no benefit at all. As the complex sugar runs out, further mutations are possible – some microbes might end up living on microbial waste products; others might kill and eat other microbes; still others might develop some form of photosynthesis and start creating sugars from sunlight – but all these possibilities draw on resources much less concentrated and abundant than the complex sugar that made the first mutation succeed so spectacularly. Nothing available to the microbes will allow them to continue to flourish as they did in the heyday of the first mutation.<br><br>Does this same logic apply to human beings? A cogent example from 20th century history argues that it does. When the Second World War broke out in 1939, Germany arguably had the most innovative technology on the planet. All through the war, German technology stayed far ahead of the opposition, fielding jet aircraft, cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, guided bombs, and many other advances years before anybody else. Their great vulnerability was a severe shortage of petroleum reserves, and even this area saw dramatic technological advances: Germany developed effective methods of CTL (coal to liquids) fuel production, and put them to work as soon as it became clear that the oil fields of southern Russia were permanently out of reach.<br><br>The results are instructive. Despite every effort to replace petroleum with CTL and other energy resources, the German war machine ran out of gas. By 1944 the Wehrmacht was struggling to find fuel even for essential operations. The outcome of the Battle of the Bulge in the winter of 1944-5 is credited by many military historians to the raw fact that the German forces didn’t have enough fuel to follow up the initial success of their Ardennes offensive. The most innovative technology on the planet, backed up with substantial coal reserves and an almost limitless supply of slave labor, proved unable to find a replacement for cheap abundant petroleum.<br><br>It’s worthwhile to note that more than sixty years later, no one has done any better. Compare the current situation with the last two energetic transitions – the transition from wind and water power to coal in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and the transition from coal to petroleum at the beginning of the 20th – and a key distinction emerges. In both the earlier cases, the new energy resource took a dominant place in the industrial world’s economies while the older ones were still very much in use. The world wasn’t in any great danger of running out of wind and water in 1750, when coal became the mainspring of the industrial revolution, and peak coal was still far in the future in 1900 when oil seized King Coal’s throne.<br><br>The new fuels took over because they were more concentrated and abundant than the competition, and those factors made them more economical than older resources. In both cases a tide of technological advance followed the expansion of energy resources, and was arguably an effect of that expansion rather than its cause. In the 1950s and 1960s many people expected nuclear power to repeat the process – those of my readers who were around then will recall the glowing images of atomic-powered cities in the future that filled the popular media in those days. Nothing of the kind happened, because nuclear power proved to be much less economical than fossil fuels. Only massive government subsidies, alongside the hidden “energy subsidy” it received from an economy powered by cheap fossil fuels, made nuclear power look viable at all.<br><br>Mind you, uranium contains a very high concentration of energy, though the complex systems needed to mine, process, use, and clean up after it probably use more energy than the uranium itself contains. Most other resources touted as solutions to peak oil either contain much lower concentrations of energy per unit than petroleum, or occur in much lower abundance. This isn’t accidental; the laws of thermodynamics mandate that on average, the more concentrated an energy source is, the less abundant it will be, and vice versa. They also mandate that all energy transfers move from higher to lower concentrations, and this means that you can’t concentrate energy without using energy to do it. Really large amounts of concentrated energy occur on earth only as side effects of energy cycles in the biosphere that unfold over geological time – that’s where coal, oil, and natural gas come from – and then only in specific forms and locations. It took 500 million years to create our planet’s stockpile of fossil fuels. Once they’re gone, what’s left is mostly diffuse sources such as sunlight and wind, and trying to concentrate these so they can power industrial society is like trying to make a river flow uphill.<br><br>Thus the role of technological innovation in the rise of industrial economies is both smaller and more nuanced than it’s often claimed to be. Certain gateway technologies serve the same function as the mutations in the biological model used earlier in this post; they make it possible to draw on already existing resources that weren’t accessible to other technological suites. At the same time, it’s the concentration and abundance of the resource in question that determines how much a society will be able to accomplish with it. Improvements to the gateway technology can affect this to a limited extent, but such improvements suffer from a law of diminishing returns backed up, again, by the laws of thermodynamics.<br><br>Innovation is a necessary condition for the growth and survival of industrial society, in other words, but not a sufficient condition. If energy resources aren’t available in sufficient quality and quantity, innovation can make a successful society but it won’t make or maintain an industrial one. It’s worth suggesting that the maximum possible level of economic development in a society is defined by the abundance and concentration of energy resources available to that society. It’s equally possible, though this is rather more speculative, that the maximum possible technological level of an intelligent species anywhere in the universe is defined by the abundance and concentration of energy resources on the planet where that species evolves. (We’ll be talking more about this in next week’s post.)<br><br>What we’re discussing here is an application of one of the central principles of ecology. Liebig’s law – named after the 19th century German agronomist Justus von Liebig, who first proposed it – holds that the maximum growth of a community of organisms is limited by whatever necessary factor in the environment is in shortest supply. A simpler way of stating this law is that necessary resources aren’t interchangeable. If your garden bed needs phosphorus, adding nitrogen to it won’t help, and if it’s not getting enough sunlight, all the fertilizer in the world won’t boost growth beyond a certain point.<br><br>For most of human history, the resource that has been in shortest supply has arguably been energy. For the last three hundred years, and especially for the last three-fourths of a century, that’s been less true than ever before. Today, however, the highly concentrated and abundant energy resources stockpiled by the biosphere over the last half billion years or so are running low, and there are no other resources on or around Earth at the same level of concentration and abundance. Innovation is vital if we’re to deal with the consequences of that reality, but it can’t make the laws of thermodynamics run backwards and give us an endless supply of concentrated energy just because we happen to want one.

With the disindustrial tsunami about to come our way, "economic development" may be an idea whose time has passed. Life, if we are able to continue it, will again revolve around growing and maintaining food instead of credit, travel and trinkets. We need to think in different categories, categories new to us perhaps, but possibly very ancient. Our critical food supply future (to say nothing of the monumental inconveniences to come), however, is not nearly our most dire need. It is our oldest need: the mental one; the need to find some way to make sense of a new way of life, to describe and define the creeds and codes of the villagers we are about to become.<br> And this is exactly why I look forward to seeing your thoughts every midweek.

He implied that you may have to put more energy into nuclear power than what you get out when you account for all of the energy intensive processes required to make it possible. If this were true and the only energy source was nuclear then there would be no net energy gain and the process would not be able to continue. Currently, since fossil fuel energy is used in the necessary processes they subsidise the energy cost and hide the inefficiencies.<br><br>I am not sure if nuclear actually has a negative energy return but I plan to look into it.

Trouble is, I reckon you’re preaching to the converted.<br><br>Like Duig, one of the things Jared Diamond put into words for me in Collapse “is the tremendous power of denial and rigid thinking, even in the face of unfolding crises”. Actually, especially in the face of unfolding crises.<br><br>I’d been observing it on all scales all my life and was already aware of it, but “Collapse” really wrapped it up for me. In short, no matter how good your explanation of limits, people really don’t want to know, so you’ll just be shut out as yet another greenie crank.<br><br>By the way, I’ll give you that Jared Diamond’s Collapse “has some problems (mostly via overgeneralizing from a handful of ecologically marginal societies) but it makes some valid points, especially about the need to take the stability of the ecosystem into account in economic and social questions.” Trouble is, I think that with a few fortunate exceptions, most societies are much more marginal than we like to think.<br><br>The crucial limit may not be land or water, it may even be some social resource, but time and time again societies have shown that they can fall remarkably quickly.<br><br>By the way, I live in Australia, the driest inhabited continent on earth with the thinnest, least fertile soils. There are really only a few thin strips were people can reasonably live, even short term.<br><br>With careful, loving management, it would probably give a good life to about 3 million people indefinitely, as experts suggested in the late nineteenth century. Instead the boosters and developers packed over 20 million in, all parasitizing limited, failing farmland and a few good mines.<br><br>Guess what, suddenly, we’re running into the wall. Suddenly there isn’t enough water even in good years to come close to running our cities and our trade deficit is enormous, despite us being in the middle of the biggest mining boom ever (thank God for China). What happens next time mining has a few off years is anyone’s guess.<br><br>So you see, I’m sort of hyper-aware of all this limits stuff.<br><br>Anyway, after all that rambling, on to the main point: I suspect that unless some miracle, science fiction power source like harnessing dark energy or permanent magnet over unity motors rescues us, future generations will regard as with cold loathing as the generations that squandered the resources that could have taken us to the stars, made mankind immortal and set up the earth for permanent, comfortable habitation on McMansions and SUVs (the Olduvai Theory).<br><br>I guess this is what history feels like, what the Germans felt like when they realized they were losing the war and sooner of later would have to answer some rather difficult questions about just what did happen to that nice Jewish family who used to live next door, worse yet, answer them to their own children and grandchildren.<br><br><a href=innovation-fallacy.html#c7274211025565879759 title="comment permalink">9/13/07, 5:30 PM</a><br><br>

So? Unless it's accessible to us in a concentrated and abundant form, it won't power an industrial society. The energy bound up in matter by nuclear forces can't be extracted without using even more energy than you'd get out of it, except in the very small handful of elements that are unstable enough to be fissionable. That means trying to power a society off it is like trying to support yourself by paying $2 for $1 bills. <br><br>Rohit, you've missed the point of the post. Sunlight may be abundant but it's very diffuse. (If you had one hand in sunlight and the other hand in burning gasoline, you'd notice the difference; that's the difference between diffuse and concentrated energy.) To concentrate diffuse energy into usable intensities, you have to invest a lot of additional energy; if you have to power that process from the diffuse energy source, most of the energy will be used up in the process and your net energy is going to be very small. <br><br>Adrian, many thanks!<br><br>Joel, what your nuclear engineer friends don't talk about is that the French nuclear industry gets huge subsidies from the French government; it also benefits, like every other "alternative" energy resource just now, from the fact that most of the energy needed to establish and run the nuclear industry comes from fossil fuels. <br><br>Farfetched, yes, I have a regrettable sense of humor. I also remember the words "limitless" and "resource" being used in the same sentence -- almost always a recipe for nonsense. <br><br>Jon, when Carter tried to sell the meme of conservation to the US public he was crucified for his pains. The best way to end a political career in America is to tell consumers they can't have something that they want. This doesn't show a level of thinking much above the bacterial. <br><br>Quick Brown Fox, you're right that nuclear power has very low, and possibly negative, net energy. It's also uneconomical in a financial sense, though. Am I the only person left these days who remembers the WPPSS bankruptcy of the early 1980s? The sheer cost of trying to build a half dozen big nuclear plants, even when electricity rates were tolerably high, caused the largest municipal bond default in American history.<br><br><a href=innovation-fallacy.html#c8467705771701151546 title="comment permalink">9/13/07, 5:51 PM</a><br><br>

Of course someone will counter that if you had your hand at the focus of a solar collector the experience would be rather different; but of course that requires having metal, glass, etc. all these other energy-intensive manufactured materials to create. I could ignite the gasoline by literally banging two rocks together. <br><br>This leads to one of the most critical points in all this, which you stated (in reference to nuclear power) as: "it also benefits, like every other 'alternative' energy resource just now, from the fact that most of the energy needed to establish and run the nuclear industry comes from fossil fuels." I have rarely gotten anywhere trying to point this out to solar/geothermal/wind/etc. afficionados. They rightly point out that all those components COULD be manufactured by using alternative energy sources, too; but I just have this strong suspicion that when you start having to use solar to power the mining equipment and smelt the ore to make the metals to make the solar collectors, etc., the cost effectiveness goes rapidly out the window in an escalating feedback loop. <br><br>Agriculture is a case where civilization was fundamentally transformed (actually, brought into existence) by innovations in technology that allowed the concentration of formerly dispersed resources (i.e. food).

It demonstrates the limits of growth in a situation where the boundy value (the amount of medium) becomes limiting. For depletable resources this is an OK approach. But, energywise, Earth is much much much more an open system than a closed system. Our rate of use of fossil fuels is much much much less that the rate at which new energy enters (and leaves) the system. <br><br>You seem to be saying that somehow fossil fuels are especially concentrated and that this makes then special. But, if you consider the electric energy per pound produced by a solar panel compared to that produced by coal, it is 200 time greater. Fossil fuels, for most of us, are concentrated in somebody else's petri dish and we've had to build a huge parasitic infrastructure to bring them to us. By contrast, solar power requires a one car train instead of a full coal train, a schooner instead of an oil tanker and a coast guard instead of a navy.<br><br>You mention thermodynamics, but thermodynamics goes against fossil fuels unless all you want is heat. Photons ariving from the sun have incredibly low entropy and solar panels convert this to low entropy electricity via quantum conversion, providing much better effciency than plants to produce mere BTUs. <br><br>You express a correct worry about what the net energy of nuclear power is. In France, it takes the output of three reactors to enrich the fuel used in the 59 that they have. Recalling that energy production from nuclear power is subject to thermodynamics, that gives an energy return on energy invested of about 7 considering the enrichment cost alone while other energy costs bring this lower. But for a solar panel, the energy that goes into making it is payed back in about 2 years of mid-latitude use so that just under warrantee it has an energy return on energy invested of 12.5. Accounting for degradation and extending use out to a centrury, the value goes up to 33. With recycling it approches 100.<br><br>Innovation looks a little bit like your mutation analogy, there are many thing that are tried but only one or two efforts pay off, but it is also different because it is purposeful. Understanding that quantum conversion is not subject to the problems of heat engines drives the research in solar photovoltaics and the payoff in terms of reduced costs for energy are about become manifest. <br><br>Solar power may make rivers flow up hill, but only to save a bit of power for some late night activities. That is not such an unreasonable thing to do.<br><br><a href=innovation-fallacy.html#c1370710383915412143 title="comment permalink">9/13/07, 8:22 PM</a><br><br>

I realized long ago that technology did not lead us to industry. In fact, highly concentrated and relatively easy to extract, hydrocarbon energy in the hands of clever humans gave us industrial society, which in turn encouraged technolgy and innovation. What I like to tell people, on the rare occasion that I can get anyone to talk about the post oil future, is that when we start to move down the slippery slope of diminishing hydrocarbon resources we will also start to abandon our technological innovation because the energy will be too valuable to waste it on activity with an uncertain payoff. Risk has a very different connotation when you are dealing with a valuable (scarce) resource. As we move away from technical innovation towards a more pragmatic store of useful knowledge there will be no going back. There will never be another industrial age. The remaining resources are too depleted and too diffuse to be economically viable in a low-tech future. We are living in a unique and passing phase of human existence. A couple of hundred years from now no one will even remember what the industrial age was and it won't matter because it will have no relevance to that time anyway. Forget the science fiction vision of traveling to the stars. In the future, if there are any of us left, we will again be living under the stars.<br><br><a href=innovation-fallacy.html#c6635259979829421568 title="comment permalink">9/13/07, 9:01 PM</a><br><br>

I suspect you may be confusing technological LEVEL and technological INTENSITY.<br><br>Vast civilizations such as our present one with 6 billion plus members need huge, abundant and concentrated power sources just to stay functioning. However, I can easily imagine a civilization that has limited itself to, say, 250 million, educated, equal citizens carefully spaced out over a planet such as Earth. Such a culture could fairly easilylive within their planet’s permanently available resources AND develop high technology, even star-faring technology.<br><br>Until they could tap dark energy or something, their planet-side technology would not be very INTENSE, but a comfortable 1950s, middle class, Western lifestyle should be readily available to all their citizens, essentially forever.<br><br>No, no V8 cars, just little electric runabouts that were passed down to the next generation. Suburbs would still be possible though, linked to “down town” by extensive light rail networks.<br><br>Maintaining that lifestyle would of course be made a lot easier by a stable population that meant that things (homes, schools, bridges, solar power grids, railways) would only have to be built (well) once, then renewed (recycled) every thousand years or so.<br><br>Of course, that degree of dedication and community spirit would require a system that prevented the accumulation of too much wealth by any individual or group. There is some good research indicating that the wealthy as a class have less commitment to community or environment, being able to “move on” as they can.<br><br><a href=innovation-fallacy.html#c7789920990527906290 title="comment permalink">9/13/07, 10:25 PM</a><br><br>

This is what nuclear power is about. When a heavy atom is split, the lighter atoms and particles that are left, have less mass than the original atom. The missing mass becomes energy. The reverse happens when light atoms are combined in fusion reactions. When two are combined, the resulting atom has less mass than the original atoms combined. Lead is the most stable element in the periodic table. Lighter elements can be fused and heavier ones can be split. The elements in lead's neighborhood, have little potential energy at all.<br><br>Beyond that we have Star Trek Technology with antimatter reactions. Antimatter is matter with an opposite charge.

They don't even come close.<br><br>Somewhere between theory and practicality, there is an unexplained disconnect. As accurate information about the costs of fuel and other expenses is safeguarded for national security reasons, we're left with only tidbits of information to work with.<br><br>There are a couple of nuclear physicists on the Yahoo Group, 'Energy Resources' that argue that if the US military didn't subsidize our commercial programs by refining uranium and plutonium for weapons, the the uranium for commercial reactors would be too expensive to use. We wouldn't have civilian nuclear reactors at all, if we weren't building nuclear weapons. I can't prove this assertion one way or another.<br><br>But still, if nuclear energy is living up to theory, why does it cost so much more than less efficient oil?<br><br>Now I have one serious problem with nuclear power after all of this. It seems that decommissioning a plant is still a matter of theory. Estimated costs are so high, that plants are refurbished to keep them running, rather than decommission them when their time is due. I can accept arguments for this case. It seems reasonable.<br><br>But Peak Oil throws a monkey wrench into the equation. If we can't afford to decommission plants now, then there is no reason to think that as we go through the downturn, that we'll ever be able to decommission them.<br><br>I've asked several nuclear engineers what would happen if our nukes were never decommissioned and allowed to decay and fall apart. They all told me the same thing.<br><br>All of the nuclear power plants will melt down and explode if they are not decommissioned or kept in service. They will all turn into fiery nuclear geysers.<br><br>Even if they are decommissioned, they require ten thousands years of maintenance.

I'm curious, though -- in what way does this help you develop a useful response to the crisis of industrial society? <br><br>Yooper, you can't give a message to somebody who's decided in advance not to hear it. My more modest goal is to help those people who are open to the message think their way through some of the comfortable but misleading mythologies our culture has built up around the future. <br><br>Jim, the fact that you disagree with my arguments doesn't make them poorly researched. Look into the energy cost of nuclear power <i>as a whole system</i> -- digging up the ore, refining it, processing it, shipping it, building a nuclear power plant, maintaining it, dealing with the nuclear waste, and decommissioning the plant -- and you've got something very close to the amount of energy the plant will produce in its working life. As for the relationship between energy concentration and abundance, well, in a universe where energy inevitably moves from higher to lower concentrations, an inverse correlation between concentration and abundance is statistically inevitable. We'll be talking about that more next week. <br><br>Chris, the problem with your solar power analogy is again that a single solar panel is only a small part of a very complex system. Add up the total energy cost of the system -- mining the rare minerals needed for solar cells, building the machinery to make them, making the solvents and other supplies, keeping the clean rooms going, and everything else -- and coal is much more economical: that's why coal is in widespread use right now, while solar energy only fills niche markets. Since most of the energy that goes into making and distributing solar cells comes from fossil fuels, furthermore, PV looks more economical than it is -- if you had to power the entire manufacturing process (including raw material extraction) for solar cells, using only electricity from solar cells, your costs skyrocket. (This is what's coming to be called the Law of Receding Horizons, and will be getting a post here in the not too distant future.) <br><br>Bill, excellent! I do think that people hundreds and even thousands of years from now will remember the industrial age, if only because some of its aspects make great fodder for bards and traveling storytellers, but your point about the twilight of innovation is a good one. My guess is that there's still plenty of room for innovation, but it'll be focused on increasing the efficiency of existing techniques. <br><br>Stephen, I suppose a society of the sort you've proposed is theoretically possible, but like most Utopias it requires human beings (or other sentient creatures) to ignore the potent biological drives that put us at the top of the planetary food chain in the first place. <br><br>Bunnygirl, I don't think there's a solution to our present problems, if by that you mean a way of avoiding the end of the industrial age and a long decline in population, energy use, and economic output. But you're quite right that alternative thinking can make it much easier for us to deal with the predicament of industrial society than just blundering ahead or trying to go back to some allegedly better society of the past. <br><br>Weaseldog, the long-term fate of today's nuclear reactors has been very much on my mind as well.<br><br>Boysmom, thanks for the reference! This is exactly the issue. I suspect a fair number of the people in the studies who refused to change, and died, used some variant of the arguments we've seen here -- some doctor will come up with something that will save me, or it's all somebody else's fault, or what have you. <br><br>Loveandlight, the Germans learned mass production long before the war and used it to turn out aircraft and other military gear in vast amounts. The big concentration camps all had in-camp factories where prisoners worked at assembly lines producing munitions. They didn't run out of planes, tanks, or bullets -- they ran out of fuel and, toward the end, cannon fodder.<br><br><a href=innovation-fallacy.html#c145983696125784718 title="comment permalink">9/14/07, 12:14 PM</a><br><br>

These are standard silicon, thin film silicon, multi-junction silicon and thin film non-silcon. I should have been more clear that I was discussing standard silicon when talking about the energy payback time. Standard silicon does not involve rare resources, and the energy inputs are well understood, so the payback time is a solid number. What may have changed since the last time you looked at this is increased scale of production and improved methods of fabrication. Most large producers are trying to match what Evergreen Solar is achieving in energy savings through reduced loss of refined silicon during fabrication. The energy cost of recycling panels fabricated in this way has also been studied and it is about one third the original energy input. This is why the EROEI can asymtopically approach 100, but over centruries of use. These numbers are all solid. The main thing driving price for standard silicon is the transition between using scrap from integrated circuit manufacture as a raw material to dominating the use of purified silicon. Fabrication costs for an integrated purification and manufacture come to about $1.50/Watt for a 500 MW/year operation. Retail is a little below $5/Watt.<br><br>Thin film silicon, say amorphous silicon, also does not rely exotic materials and while less efficient in energy collection it may be more durable than standard silicon since amorphous material may be less prone to cosmic ray induces performance degradation. It is less well studied but likely has a higher EROEI because much less refined silicon is used in its manufacture. It is less well suited to residential rooftop use because it is hard to cover energy use at its efficiency. These retail for $3/Watt.<br><br>Multi-junction silicon does use exotic material but also often uses concentrators so that the amount of materials used is not so large. Because of the use of concentrators, the EROEI can be fairly high since there is also less purified silicon used and the efficiency of conversion is high. Prices for these are especially high because they cater to small markets such as space applications.<br><br>Thin film non-silicon panels use rare earths where they are in production and their EROEI is not well understood partly because they have not yet forces a supply sqeeze for their raw materials which are often co-produced in unrealted mining operations and partly because their durability is still not estabilished. First Solar is working closely with NREL to get this later issue figured out. Their recycling characteristics are not well studied either. These panels, like thin film silicon, have a lower efficeincy than standard silicon but they are coming to dominate the commercial market because the commercial market is satisfied with <br>10 year power purchase agreements and the wholesale prices for these panels are the lowest, going down to $1/Watt for Nanosolar. Under conditions where their raw materials are produced no matter what, their EROEI is likely quite high because there is little material involved in either the substrate or the PV film. The concern you raise applies chiefly to these if their raw materials become scarce. I know of no study though that shows that powering the world energy use with this technology sufficiently strains available reserves so as to make it unfeasable. Because recycling of these panels is not at all well understood, the effects on dilution of rare elements or EROEI are unknown. Non-silicon thin film may end up being a market blip since the cost for standard silicon is expected to continue to fall and its advantages in known durability and higher efficeincy may bring it back into favor in the commercial market once it is done getting its toes wet and is ready to take a full plung. <br><br>At this point, solar competes with gas rather than coal and as such it is much more economical. With higher market penetration it will need to dip a little lower in price to compete with coal, but not by much. To compete with night time coal, storage will be needed, but the cost of coal is also rising owing to substiution of lower grades, so the cost of storage need only fall to a few cents per kWh to make penny per kWh solar more attractive than night time coal. It is worth remembering that the cost of solar is all up front while the cost of coal includes an ongoing fuel input. This gives coal some financing advantages, but when you notice that the cost of gas is even more weighted to fuel cost, and that solar is growing very rapidly because it is cheaper than gas, it seems as though this stumbling block is starting to be surmounted.<br><br><a href=innovation-fallacy.html#c5873127263778660028 title="comment permalink">9/15/07, 9:23 AM</a><br><br>

That is an example of poor planning as a result of pressure form an all powerful industry and seeing patterns where none exist. The area had abundant hydro power, rivers waiting to be choked to provide power. Cheap electricity turned Bauxite to the aluminum that allowed Seattle to become the home city of Boeing. Cheap electricity powered trains over the mountains. Who cared if baseboard heaters were under windows, just crank up the thermostat. <br><br>Life was easy for planners. Look at capacity and usage some years ago, look at it today, draw a straight line, build another dam to bring capacity to the line and usage will follow. It worked for almost 40 years but something happened on the way to Nirvana. People started asking things like "Should we dam Hells Canyon?" So they substituted Nuclear power to make the production come up to what they thought would be consumption.<br><br>They started one plant at Hanford. Then drew the lines again and decided that they needed another. What could be cheaper than just taking already approved plans and duplicating them again? Then western Washington wanted some of that construction money. No worry. draw that line again and turn on the duplication machine.

Salvage is the mostly unrecognized cushion that may just help us to a soft landing -- more on this in the months to come, as I plan on discussing a range of technologies well suited to a deindustrializing world. <br><br>Joel, solar reflectors are an entirely different cat from PV cells -- I've commented here more than once that the French used to have solar steam engines in their North African colonies before cheap diesel priced them out of the market. Butti and Perlin's book "A Golden Thread" has the details. The efficiencies aren't that high but the initial energy investment is very modest and I'd be amazed if the net energy wasn't well up in single digits, if not low double. <br><br>Panidaho, that corresponds to everything I've read about nuclear -- the actual output is a fraction of the theoretical, and even the theoretical isn't that good in net energy terms. <br><br>Ares, all good points. <br><br>Chris, PV promoters have been saying all these things for the last 30 years, and yet the market doesn't bear them out. If solar was as economical as you suggest, utilities and municipalities would have been piling into them like gangbusters since the California brownouts a few years back as an investment -- and they aren't. <br><br>The small city where I live, for example, has been buying PV arrays for public buildings for some time now. Nobody here pretends that they're an investment, or that they'll pay for themselves; they're seen as a sort of charitable contribution to the environment, as well as an emergency backup for times when the power grid here in southern Oregon gets wonky. In other words, solar is still a boutique product with a narrow niche market. If it were competitive with fossil fuels, given its other advantages, that wouldn't be the case. <br><br>Dan, bingo -- the whole catastrophic Russian campaign was in large part an attempt to get enough oil to keep the Wehrmacht running. <br><br>Bunnygirl, thanks for the clarification. As for the alternatives, I hope to talk about some of them shortly. <br><br>Yooper, one of the problems is that we actually don't have very good figures for human population until quite recently -- I note, for example, the recent discovery of a whole landscape of previously unsuspected cities in the fourth millennium BCE, bridging the space between Sumer and northwestern India. But your broader point stands -- the last three hundred years worth of reckless consumption of fossil fuels has pushed human population figures right off the charts.

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c3980912089483508052></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/17404310713482611952 rel=nofollow>Lance Michael Foster</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Exactly, JMG! The western attachment and idealization of "progress" is part of our society's most cherished ideals. However, I have always believed that "progress" is not an improvement, but a reaction to failure. Agriculture was a reaction to insufficient hunting and gathering resources. In North America, we see this in the Archaic shift to heavier reliance on small game and vegetal resources once the megafauna were gone from the PaleoIndian period. And when population growth hit a crisis in the Midwest, the growth reliance on corn was a reaction to insufficient game and wild plant resources (although the nutrients in corn were much less than wild foods). Progress is essentially then, a reaction to entropy, and the ecological laws you have discussed here.<br><br>Thus, the quest for meaning can be combined with our growing understanding of science (ecology, physics, etc.) in understanding that entropy is what we all struggle against, individually against disease, aging, death, and collectively in ecological collapse, epidemics and war. Our oldest myths can help in this, as the lessons of ecological and social collapse are inherent in them, such as Ragnarok and the cannibalism myths of society turned upside down in the Americas.<br><br>Great blog, JMG!!<br><br><a href=innovation-fallacy.html#c3980912089483508052 title="comment permalink">9/24/07, 5:37 AM</a><br><br>
