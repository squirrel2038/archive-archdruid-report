Last week’s Archdruid Report post introduced five themes likely to be primary factors shaping the deindustrial future before us. It’s easy to talk about such things in the abstract, but harder to make sense of them as a lived reality, and it’s this latter step that has to be taken to understand their impact on our world. For this reason I’ve picked up the toolkit of narrative fiction again. Each of the next five essays will be preceded by a fictional account of one person’s journey through a world shaped by the themes I’ve mentioned. The story begins in the rural Pacific Northwest sometime in the second half of this century.<br><br>*****************<br><br>Adam stepped out onto the cracked blacktop and moss of the parking lot, blinked in the glare of the westering sun. Habit made him reach back with his one good hand to close the door, but he caught himself, let the hand fall. No point in closing things up now; winter wasn’t far, and the place might as well be useful to the bears.<br><br>One of the beneficiaries of that act gazed blindly down on him in concrete effigy as he crossed the parking lot. It had a sign in its paws saying Learyville Motel – a neon sign once, though the tubes got a coat of white paint once electricity went away. Another bear, chainsawed from a fir log, stood on its hind legs by the motel office. The bear had always been Learyville’s mascot; the school team had been the Bears, back when there was a school team, or a school for that matter. It would just be the bears’ town now, though.<br><br>He stopped at the highway’s edge, tensed himself against memories that pushed the limits of his self-control, then settled his pack on his shoulders and started west. Still, the memories came surging up, blinding him. He thought of Learyville the way it was when he’d been five or six, when most of the houses had families in them and cars still came roaring down the highway in long lines on their way to campgrounds and fishing spots and the ocean beaches. Things had been better still before he was born, so the old folks said, back when gas was so cheap you could drive all day on twenty dollars, and the Learyville Motel had its <span style="font-style: italic">Sorry – No Vacancy</span> sign lit up every summer evening. Still, the town seemed crowded enough in his childhood; he’d had playmates in those days, and you had to be careful crossing the street. <br><br>That was before the war, of course. Once war came, gas rationing canceled most vacations, and a dozen young men from the town went off in uniform, leaving their family’s windows decorated with blue stars that turned gold one by one. Nobody wanted to talk about that, and Adam had to ask his father what it meant, one night when just the two of them sat in the motel office. Afterwards, staring into the night from his bedroom window, he thought about the people he knew who wouldn’t be coming home again. The image that came to mind was an old blanket the moths ate full of holes one summer. The moths had gotten into Learyville, too, and a cold wind was blowing through the holes.<br><br>The moths hadn’t finished with the town, either. The summer Adam turned eleven, when the fighting reached Mexico and people stopped talking about the war except in worried whispers, the bridge on the road down to Southport collapsed under the car on the way back from a trip to the grocery store. He didn’t remember a thing between the lurch of the bridge giving way and the hospital room where they told him his mother was dead. His right arm was a mess, and they’d never been able to afford the therapy that would have fixed it, so a mess it stayed. <br><br>When the armistice came a year later, most of Learyville buzzed with talk about how soon the good times would be back, but Adam’s father slumped back in his overstuffed chair and told him they were whistling past the graveyard. Though gas stayed rationed and the economy lurched from crisis to crisis, a trickle of tourists came down the highway again, but even that shred of hope turned against the town. Nobody ever figured out which tourist brought hemorrhagic fever to Learyville, but three months afterward almost fifty people were dead. Other epidemics followed, but that first one left gaps in Learyville’s fabric that nothing afterward could patch.<br><br>Adam shook his head and kept walking, but the houses he passed stared back at him with empty eyes like so many skulls. That blue one had been Joe and Edna Williams’, before she died of the hemorrhagic fever and he drank himself to death; the green one back there was Fred Kasumi’s before he died and his sons left for the city in search of work; the brick one next to it had been the Dotsons’ since Learyville was a logging camp, and old Marge Dotson lived there for years after everyone else in the family was dead or gone, tending her chickens and her garden until he found her lying face down in her asparagus bed one morning.<br><br>Across from the Dotson house was the Hungry Bear Café, with the stripped and rusting shells of a dozen cars still in the parking lot. Those broke Adam’s pace, though he made himself keep going after a moment. Those cars didn’t belong to tourists or locals. They started arriving one or two at a time in the years right after the war, full of young people convinced, like their hippie grandparents before them, that going back to the land was the wave of the future. Some of the newcomers moved into empty houses on the edge of town and tried to farm for a few years before loneliness, sickness, or the thin acid soil that had defeated the original homesteaders in the 1800s drove them back to the city or straight to the Learyville cemetery. Few came to farm and fewer stayed long; better land could be had close enough to urban areas to provide a market for cash crops.<br><br>No, most of the ones who came had a different dream. They parked their cars in the café parking lot, paid for one more civilized meal, and then headed out into the woods, convinced they were destined to found the tribal societies of an age about to be born. Those who spotted Adam tried to talk him into coming along; their excited gestures and bright eyes lit up a grand vision of life in the wilderness in harmony with nature, walking the hunter-gatherer path. The first few times he’d gone back to the motel with his head afire, and his father had to sit him down and explain exactly what would happen to a bunch of city kids who thought nature would welcome them with open arms. He’d been right, too. Some of them came stumbling back out of the forest months later, starving and shivering and riddled with parasites. Others never came out at all, and Adam got used to finding their bones in the woods when he and his father went hunting deer in the hills outside of town. For them, nature had opened not her arms but her jaws.<br><br>One group left something else behind, though, and that was what made Adam halt and then push himself onward outside the café. There had been six of them, three boys and three girls, none of them much older than Adam himself, and they’d gone into the woods with whoops of laughter early one summer. Three of them died in the usual ways as the forest patiently tested them to destruction; the three survivors came back as winter came and the rain changed to sleet, two of the boys carrying one desperately ill girl. The Prices took them in; the boys struggled back to health and fled in someone else’s car as soon as they could, but the girl, Sybil, stayed.<br><br>She had some kind of relapsing fever – probably from a tick bite, Vinny said, though he wasn’t sure, and by then there were no doctors within reach. She had no family and nowhere to go, so the Prices gave her a home, and she returned the favor by caring for them when she was well enough. She and Adam found their way into a relationship within a few weeks. It wasn’t love, or even sex, so much as the raw loneliness of a town that by then had only a dozen residents. Still, lying in each other’s arms or sitting by the Price’s fireplace, they talked about marriage, imagined a future when the tourists came back and the two of them ran the motel. When the fever finally took her on an icy February day four years later, Adam walked down to the river and thought long and hard about jumping in before he turned and went back to the motel.<br><br>By then the cafe was open only on Saturday nights, when the last handful of locals gathered to share a meal and play cards by firelight, and the motel was all closed up except for the manager’s home and two rooms. Another war was going by then, a civil war this time, and the only visitors were government draft agents scrounging the countryside for anyone fit to carry a gun. Adam got used to the way they’d look at him, size up his crumpled arm, and reluctantly decide that he wouldn’t earn them their bounty. Finally even the draft agents stopped coming, and life in Learyville became a round of waiting, never very long, for the next death.<br><br>Call of a bluejay shook Adam out of his memories, and he turned around. Afternoon was turning toward evening, but no smoke rose from the chimneys of any of the houses he’d passed and no light shone from the windows. The general store, post office, and gas station that anchored the western end of town were tumbling in on themselves, half overgrown already with blackberry vines. In the distance, a stray gleam of red sunlight hit the big concrete bear in front of the motel, made it glow like an ember about to go out.<br><br>He drew in a deep breath, reviewed the things he’d packed: all the clothes he owned that hadn’t gone to holes yet; blankets for sleeping; a cooking pot, tinder, and the flint and steel he’d learned to use once matches stopped being available; some useful tools; a tarp for shelter, and rope and stakes to put it up; bandages and a bottle of the herb tincture Carol Price used to make for wounds; down at the bottom of the pack, a ring that had been Sybil’s, and the six best asparagus crowns from Marge’s garden, on the off chance that he’d find a place to plant them someday. He had a good sturdy knife on his belt and his father’s revolver in his coat pocket; the one thing he didn’t have was a destination, but that didn’t matter much, not just then.<br><br>Tears pushed through then, and dampened his face. There had been one last grave to dig this afternoon, this time for his father; one more hole in the fabric; that was over now, and so was Learyville. He turned west and started down the highway, leaving the town to the bears and the dark trees of the forest.

You remember, she found him on the internet around the time the fever first showed up in Seattle, back before the phones went dead. Real striking guy, talking about new Jerusalem and all that, you could almost understand why she might think he had all the answers and knew the way out of this mess. Seems I remember there were a lot of guys like that for a while. Didn't some of them get involved in the civil wars, too? Wonder what became of all them. Pushing up daisies just like the rest of 'em, I reckon.

But on rereading, I appreciated that you had set it in a particularly vulnerable place: an isolated town with a tourist economy and poor options for farming. And you make references to places where circumstances are different, some of which we will doubtless see in later installments. Towns like this would be the first to lose electric, phone, and maintained roads in a decline, for the same reasons they were the last to get them. <br><br>So is Adam's "toolkit" he takes with him perhaps a metaphor for the toolkit we need to assemble as a society for our own unknown future?<br><br><a href=adams-story-twilight-in-learyville.html#c5839568979280398403 title="comment permalink">5/30/07, 6:20 AM</a><br><br>

Here in the US, the vast majority of people don't have a clue how to put bear on the menu -- if anything, it's likely to be the other way around. If the crisis ahead of us was primarily a food crisis, I'd be worried about the bears, but as it is, in the industrial world, food shortages aren't likely to become a major factor until we're well down the curve of decline. More on this in next week's post.<br><br>And yes, I'd be delighted to read your folklore paper -- I'll be in touch shortly. <br><br>Bill, exactly -- his part of the story focuses on the mechanisms of depopulation, and I figured the best way to do that was to show their impact on a particularly vulnerable community, modeled on places I know in the Northwest. <br><br>Is Adam's toolkit a metaphor? Nah, it's a plot engine. Stay tuned!<br><br><a href=adams-story-twilight-in-learyville.html#c2029117617457306276 title="comment permalink">5/30/07, 10:22 AM</a><br><br>

I still want to say something about it.<br><br>I've been expecting things to go pear-shaped since 1974 or so — still am — but it hasn't happened yet. Doesn't mean it won't, but we've muddled along from problem to problem so far. Heck, we might manage to keep muddling along, ending up with a best-case scenario where we bring down power and population gradually. People will disappear through brushfire civil wars as the country breaks up, limited starvation, suicide, many by medical conditions they can no longer have treated (diabetics, heart patients, cancer, diseases), flooding....<br><br>SInce Bill jumped in with a side-story and didn't get whacked for it, so will I. :-) What happened to the Chinese invasion? During the civil war here, didn't they try to assemble a fleet to shift their population problem here? Did a typhoon take them out, or did they make it but too weak from starvation to defend themselves (let alone attack)?

Chalk it up to stress. Besides, it made for some great imagery. But you'll certainly be seeing more of Adam; he'll be the viewpoint character throughout this series. <br><br>As for the deleted comment, my experience is that it's a waste of everyone's time to try to reason with trolls, so please don't. <br><br>The muddling-through future you've suggested is actually fairly close to the scenario I consider most likely, so long as you factor in the results of political breakdown and localized disasters of the Katrina variety. Most civilizations fall that way, bit by bit.<br><br>As for your Chinese invasion, you guys gotta lay off with the crystal balls. Except it's not quite an invasion, and it's not from China. If you glance back to the original post that launched this series, you might notice that the second of my five themes is <b>migration</b>.

She tells the story through two sociologists from New Jersey, Frank and Deborah Popper, who saw this transformation as early as the 1980's. They have proposed that in place of the failed attempt at agriculture and ranching in that part of the Midwest, the prairie should be restored and the buffalo brought back. <br><br>The book goes into some detail about just how these towns empty out, and how those who remain deal (or don't deal) with their situation (which includes some hostility toward Eastern university-types).<br><br>A preview of the book (with additional resources):<br>http://books.google.com/books?id=2qq9XIcIkWkC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;ots=VLQ56nJ5NM&amp;dq<br><br>A more recent newspaper article which covers some of the basics:<br>http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/04/22/MN39309.DTL<br><br>An article by the Poppers which looks at the uses of metaphor in geography and regional public planning (hey, it's narratives again!):<br>http://www.gprc.org/buffalo_commons_popper.html<br><br><a href=adams-story-twilight-in-learyville.html#c1742720279446733138 title="comment permalink">5/30/07, 7:53 PM</a><br><br>

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c1505238414406924472></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/04737693388485635100 rel=nofollow>John Michael Greer</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Jason, of course you're right that detrollification is occasionally possible. The problem is that even when it works -- and it doesn't always -- it takes plenty of time, and I simply don't have that. <br><br>I work 12 hour days writing, and I've got my duties as head of AODA and my work on the Takelma Language Project (helping to resurrect a Native American language here in southern Oregon) to take care of as well. Writing and managing this blog has to be squeezed into spare time after those are dealt with. So I pretty much have to leave the cause of troll reform to those who've got the spare time and patience. <br><br>Rebecca, I see you've joined the crystal ball brigade. Stay tuned!<br><br>TRB, I wrote my first novel at the age of eleven. (Mind you, it was pretty awful.) I spent most of two decades trying to break into print in science fiction and fantasy, and failed abjectly. The praise that's come in for my narratives here has been quite a surprise to me -- I figured they would be hack work useful to communicate certain points, nothing more. But I'm glad you enjoy them. <br><br>As for the relationship between this set of stories and the world sketched out in the three Christmas posts, I haven't the least idea as yet -- I know the basic plot of the five parts of "Adam's Story," but the setting will show itself as the writing proceeds. That concrete bear at the motel, for example, was a complete surprise to me. <br><br>I've been watching the situation on the Great Plains since the middle 90s; to my mind, it's at least as big an alarm bell as the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. What we're seeing, I think, is the failure of white settlement in the inland West. There, at least, Jason's arguments have quite a bit of strength; the Great Plains and mountain West aren't ecologically suited to cereal farming along European lines. The sooner the plains in particular are turned over to a nomadic pastoral economy, the better for everyone, and it might as well be buffalo -- perfectly suited to the ecosystem, and tasty, too. <br><br>Loveandlight, actually, I'd planned on having some neoprimitivist cougar chow put in an appearance since I first envisioned this series about two months ago; in particular, Sybil was part of the backstory from the beginning. Mind you, I knew people in Seattle who loudly insisted they were going to head out into the woods the way the people in the story did, and only the fact that they were all talk and no action kept them from a similar experience.<br><br>One of the things a lot of people don't know about the evergreen forests in the coastal Northwest is that they are surprisingly barren in ecological terms -- most of the soil nutrients get leached by the rain. That's why the First Nations all through this part of the world lived at the water's edge, got most of their food from the rivers and the sea, and told hair-raising stories to their kids about the cannibalistic monsters that lived in the deep, dark, spooky forest.<br><br><a href=adams-story-twilight-in-learyville.html#c1505238414406924472 title="comment permalink">5/30/07, 9:45 PM</a><br><br>

You mention tick bites, which plague the civilized hiker, but it's a little known fact (because the context is so rarely relevant) that ticks go after humans with impaired immune systems. They can smell it in the blood.

But if it did, I think it would go more or less the way you've outlined. That's why I've urged people not to run off into the woods, but to learn primitive skills first, maybe pick up some permaculture as a stepping stone, and rewild themselves as a process, not as a sudden event. Hunting and gathering doesn't have to be hard; it's what we evolved to do, and what it takes--hunting, fishing, hiking--are things we do now and call it a vacation. But you absolutely do have to know what you're doing. Run off into the woods without knowing what you're doing, or worse, do it alone, and you'll just wind up dead.<br><br><a href=adams-story-twilight-in-learyville.html#c5763129474892310310 title="comment permalink">5/31/07, 6:40 AM</a><br><br>

One of the consequences of the distance that's opened up between most human beings and the natural world since the industrial revolution is that the difference between lots of living things, and lots of edible and useful living things, is not always easy to spot. There's a huge amount of biomass in a coastal Douglas Fir forest, but as you've pointed out, it's pretty much all Douglas fir, and that wasn't even on the list of famine foods among the local First Nations (though the new spring tips make a great tea). <br><br>Jason, I don't doubt that ticks have their taste preferences; mosquitos make a beeline (mosquitoline?) for people with inadequate vitamin B in their bloodstream, for that matter. Still, First Nations lore here on the coast, from long before grain became an item of diet, treated wood ticks as a known problem and had treatments for bites. So I'm a little skeptical of your claim as a universal rule. <br><br>But I applaud your insistence that people who want to pursue the hunter-gatherer life need to know what they're doing, and I'm glad you don't see neoprimitivism as a mass movement -- though I suspect you may be facing an unpleasant surprise. I've known far too many people who've read one too many books by John Zerzan and Daniel Quinn, and who think of going back to the hunter-gatherer economy the way so many hippies thought of going back to the land. One of the things every movement has to contend with is its own potential for debasement at the hands of popular culture.<br><br><a href=adams-story-twilight-in-learyville.html#c8606434658935807867 title="comment permalink">5/31/07, 9:22 AM</a><br><br>

I suppose this might be the Darwin Awards parade going through Learyville, but these certainly aren't people familiar with very much of the primitivist literature <i>I've</i> read.

That's at least a notch above "(PIOOMA, 2007)." Several problems I see with the hypothesis, still. Much of North America, including most of the eastern woodland tribes, were within the region of Maize culture, hence they did have grains as a significant carbohydrate source, didn't they? Additionally, organisms adapted to feeding on the blood of wildlife are not likely to have adapted to seek out high-sugar meals. These are much more readily available by sucking the sap of plants. If your evolutionary hosts are wild deer or canids, you are "designed" to live on the blood of animals that rarely, if ever, saw cereal grains. Finally, lots of people in recent years have gone on extreme cereal-free high protein diets. Having been in the woods with some of them, they get the ticks and chiggers just like the rest of us. I also have to wonder WHAT east coast you live on where people don't worry about ticks.

The northwest coast First Nations didn't do much in the way of horticulture, as most of the others did -- at least not until they got potatoes from white trappers, and took them up with gusto -- but the same mixed economy based on mastery of oceanic resources underlay the same sort of stratified society with clans, slavery, warfare, and monumental architecture.

Not about the meat versus grain debate, but about why ticks and Lyme disease didn't use to be such a problem on the East Coast. My friend is much deeper into ecology than I am, and this is the hypothesis he gave me: <br>Deer are the primary food source for the ticks that carry lyme disease. Before the settlers came, the deer (and thus the ticks) were kept in check by both the First Nation peoples and especially by their own natural predators, mostly the big mount cats. <br>However, the settlers hunted both deer and cats to the point where there were not many left in the Northeast. In the past few decades deer have slowly returned (due to conservation efforts, I'm assuming) but their predators have not. (And I'm sure middle class surbabnites don't like the idea of mountain lions coming by their mountain retreats.) That's led to an explosion in the resident deer population, and thus in the tick population. It makes sense, and according to this theory, the tick problem in the NE could be gotten under control by getting the deer population under control.<br>-Rebecca<br><br><a href=adams-story-twilight-in-learyville.html#c1017489481298582141 title="comment permalink">6/1/07, 6:02 PM</a><br><br>

Sulfur deficiency in the soil or if there is sulfur but it is complexed by the p.h. or other minerals in the soil. <br>Interestingly studies have shown that grains grown in sulfur deficient soils have dramatically less nutritional value.

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c5591117666179007670></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/04205235466179190199 rel=nofollow>Matt</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>A lot of interesting things in the post and the comments, and a lot to digest. <br><br>One thing that strikes me about JMG's fiction, and consequently the idea of going into the woods to be hunter-gatherers is the silliness of going "into the woods." Even not taking into account the massive population drops this story takes into account, there are more structures than people in this country already. It would seem to me, that finding a structure of a suitable size and condition near a wild area would be much smarter than adding the trouble of actually living under the trees to your concerns. Listen, I've read the Boy Scout manual and a few survival guides in my time, but I'd much rather live in a warm, dry shed that I'd dragged a single bed and a desk into that trying to make a shelter every night out of pine boughs and leaves. I understand that wild foods around stationary areas would disappear over time, but I still think efforts would be made to find abandoned structures instead of going off into the woods and trying to spend nights avoiding predators, dampness, and cold. Just a thought on that matter...<br><br>Twilight had a nice comment at the end of one of her posts: <i>They </i>[tribal hunter gatherers]<i> worked in groups to meet the challenges of nature.</i> This is a key idea, here. Provided JMG's crystal ball gazing is remotely true, community structures are going to be key to survival of any and all individuals. That's why it seemed that John's discussion previously of life boat communities focused too much on the preservation of knowledge and glossed over the idea that ANY true community will be a lifeboat community. Working together in stressful situations, whether local, regional, or national, is the only to ensure survival of the greatest amount of individuals. That's why wolves have packs, birds have flocks, and humans have (had, really) tribes and communities and Ruritan clubs, or what have you. It wasn't mentioned in John's fiction, but where was neighbor helping neighbor? Where was the sharing of information, advice, food, supplies? Where was the families moving in together into a larger house to maximize efforts? Man, it sounds like that place just fell apart. True, there was the mention of Sunday nights at the restaurant, but it'll take a hell of a lot more than that to survive something as monumental as this. What's in my heart and mind? Helping my neighbor get through the winter, so he can help me get through my broken leg, and we can both hold off the invanding Chinese/Australians/Midwesterners who want to eat and steal everything. And make me a communist.<br><br>Last, I'd like to address Bill Pulliam's comments about invasive species. I know, and think it's pretty clear, that invasive species are "a bad thing," but I also understand nature to be a pretty resilient thing herself. Kudzu, for instance, is actually very edible by human beings and a lot of other plant foraging creatures. Believe me: pick any road in any direction from where I sit right now and you'll find massive hillsides just covered in kudzu, but I think it'll be held back a little if, say, food prices skyrocket, or some farmer with suddenly far fewer neighbors decides to try free ranging his remaining cattle. And a thousand suddenly free and feral house cats will take car of that starling problem, though creating a whole different one in its wake since they're technically an invasive too. Sure, introducing African wildlife into the Kansas plains is a remarkably fool hardy idea, but as far as environmental impact, I'm much more concerned with the man-made chemical and industrial pollution that pockmarks the world than I am about Japanese lady bugs and hogweed. <br><br>Last, I'd like to say I really enjoyed reading John's fiction, there. I've been toying and scribbling on a little project of a similar nature, myself, though in a graphic novel package. It crossed my mind that something like what John is doing here and what I've been scribbling has the opportunity to be immensely, if not intentionally, instructional. Solutions to problems (And methods to deal with predicaments, eh?) could be presented in a fictional form, maybe to be found and implemented later, you know? The project in my head has this aspect applied a little more directly, but the graphic novel format has more flexibility in terms of how information can be laid out on a page. With text, subtlety would be a better tool.<br>Anyway, great read. The preceding post, by the way, was very helpful to me in thinking about some aspects of the future environment, though I hope to present a little more optimistic of a view than poor Adam's not-so-swell beginnings. I don't remember Eden being so rough. I guess all the apple's have already been eaten.<br><br>That's my two cents.<br><br>Solar hot water workshop next weekend! While I'm sure it's going to cover industrially-produced house size installations, you can do it just fine with black plastic and two by fours!

Imagining hunting and gathering in some idyllic pastoral situation is a far cry from the organized-by-man situation of all but the densest national parks which still have roads running through them. It's a much safer bet to use the structure already built around us for things better suited to our environment. Yes, the 15 soon to be empty big-box retailers down the road from all of us probably all can't be used for anyting too useful, but I bet if we sat down and thought about it, we could come up with something. How about storage for salvageable housing materials? Drying areas for food and seed? Bunk houses for refuge camps? Large workshops for boat manufacturing or peddle-powered vehicles? I mean, I'm being optimistic, especially since no doubt 98% of anyone's time will be spent on finding or growing food, but the point is that the Wal-Mart they built 3 years ago, the car they built last year, and everything between won't be crumbling to dust anytime soon, and all of those things will play some sort of role. Probably a key one!<br><br>I've been daydreaming about running a class or organizing some sort of workshop (and eventually writing a book) about taking apart a common soon to be useless car and repurposing every part of it into something else that would be more useful -- shovels or seats or shoes or roofing or fabric or electronics. You get the point. There's going to be a few million of the suckers sitting around. Might as well find a use for them...Problem is, I know bunk about cars.

My guess is that during the next economic downturn a lot of those will be finding their way surreptitiously into freezers. My grandparents used to tell stories of getting by during the Depression years in which poached venison played a noticeable role, and we have a respectable number of bowhunters and black powder enthusiasts hereabouts. <br><br>Eboy, very interesting about the sulfur issue. As for your comment about the economics of sustainability, this is square on -- I commented in similar terms in my post <a href=../../2007/04/cycles-of-sustainability.html rel=nofollow>Cycles of Sustainability</a> -- and this is one of the reasons I've come to think the entire "lifeboat community" notion is fatally flawed. More on this in a later post. <br><br>Matt, your comments on community and the art of salvaging the physical capital of industrial society are spot on from my perspective. I didn't stress the cooperative dimension in this story for a variety of reasons, but you'll notice it in details throughout if you look. Still, cooperative communities can still die out if the economic and ecological basis for survival isn't there. <br><br>Your idea of exploring future possibilities in a graphic novel form sounds like a good one, BTW. So does learning the skills of materials salvage. One of the major legacies of industrial society to the future will be the transfer of vast amounts of raw material from diffuse deposits far below the earth to concentrated form on the surface. Much of this can be salvaged and worked by low-tech methods, a point I'll document in detail in a future post. For now, <a href=http://www.nobugs.org/engineer/furnace/Furnace.txt rel=nofollow>here's</a> an account by a guy in Britain who built, from scratch, an effective smelter to turn aluminum scrap into ingots; the same device would work on copper and most other nonferrous metals. More on this later. <br><br><i>Viriconium</i>! Gods, it's been a long time since I've heard anyone mention Harrison's books. <i>The Pastel City</i> and Edgar Pangborn's <i>Davy</i>, both of which I first read during the energy crises of the Seventies, probably played a larger role than anything else in getting me to think outside the myth of progress and see that decline was also a possibility. Both are also thumping good reads, which probably didn't hurt. <br><br>Fergal, good -- you're thinking. You can get good crops from bare sand with organic methods, as long as you're willing to compost your own feces and every other scrap of organic matter you can, but it takes time. In a market society in the early decades of decline, it also takes an economic infrastructure that will allow you to sell your produce and pay your bills and taxes. If somebody had showed up in Learyville's last years with the tools, knowledge, and resources to start farming and keep themselves going until they could feed themselves, they probably could have made it, but the same demographic factors that made Learyville nonviable meant there were plenty of better prospects. We'll be seeing some of those later on in the series.<br><br><a href=adams-story-twilight-in-learyville.html#c1245110034553119065 title="comment permalink">6/2/07, 9:00 PM</a><br><br>

It's a pretty big country (world), and all sorts of responses none of us have even thought of will no doubt make appearances, including some confused kids wandering off into the woods to meet their demise. Really, as Danby pointed out, hunger is a great motivator, but it can also lead you to do some pretty dumb things. I guess, like bill pulliam commented, I was just struck by the darkness of John's story and wanted to present more optimistic ideas. I know that it's a pretty harsh reality that's inherent to the story; I just hoped neighbors would consider looking over the fence next door to see who lived there after the TV was shut off for good, you know? <br><br>Though, as eboy wisely pointed out, it won't be too helpful to have a lot of people, organized or not, if no one knows anything. To that, though, I have two responses. First, it takes only one person in a group to teach everybody else an item of knowledge, say one Master Gardener (Though they always have that preoccupation with flowers), or the horticulture teacher from the local community college, or that old guy who you vaguley remember seeing till his soil every year. Humans, and all predators, really, have always had organization on their side -- a feature probably best seen in the ultimate human machine, the military -- and information sharing is a hallmark of any organized system. It only takes one, is my point.<br><br>Second, to make another Viriconium reference, there's always "external brains." Libraries and used book stores and no doubt quite a few book shelves all have books that no doubt contain the crucial information needed. Heck, just today I passed up dozens of books on growing vegetables in this or that environment, using this or that method. True, many of them will be useless without the prescribed doses of triple 19, pesticides, and ready made mulch, but that doesn't mean there's not a lot of key information contained in them. Sure, sure, depending on how bleak your outlook for the future, libraries may be raided for burning material, roofs may cave in -- what have you. But if I'm looking for kindling, I'm going to start in the romance section, or maybe all those diet books and C++ code books. <br><br>Sure, there's a lot of knowledge that's been lost to our collective and individual conciousness -- Right now, I have no idea when to plant a lot of vegetables, any signs of the weather, etc -- but that doesn't mean it isn't written down somewhere, and looking back to point one, once you've read it, you can tell your neighbor. <br><br>One last rant. I keep quiet on three months of posts, and now I'm stinkin' Faulkner over here.<br><br>It seems to me that it doesn't matter if a lot of what a level-headed peak oiler predicts doesn't come true at all. There are some things, I personally believe, that are unavoidable -- energy costs will rise, no matter what, for instance. But one thing I think that saves the whole deal, and why I never have any pangs of doubt about my views of the future, is that very few people advocate responses that would be harmful should we all be wrong. Stronger local/regional communities and economies are good things. Getting to know your local farmers is a good thing. Driving less and walking/biking more is a good thing. Increasing the efficiency of the systems that surround you is a good thing. Reducing your energy input and your environmental footprint is a good thing. No. Matter. What. Happens. <br><br>I mean, even if we find a billion jillion new barrels of oil (And really turn that screw tight on our eventual fate!), I truly and honestly believe all of you who have made changes based on a suddenly false guess about the future will be happier, healthier, wiser, and wealthier (On many levels). <br><br>Last! I promise! -- I was speaking to salvaging cars on a more nuts and bolts level, things outside of using the alternator on a windmill, or the battery in a PV system. Things like using the tires for rubber sandals, and the seat covers for fabric, and the sheet metal in the body for shovels or roofing tiles, the frame for raw metal, the springs for tool steel. Not that the former aren't great ideas, but the latter's a little more complete. Thanks for the support of the idea, though!<br><br><a href=adams-story-twilight-in-learyville.html#c5459190405704328459 title="comment permalink">6/3/07, 5:13 PM</a><br><br>

Look at the historical record, not the paleontological one. There is scarcely an ecosystem on earth that has not suffered LOSS of biodiversity and impairment of function because of human-introduced alien species. My biggest beef with permaculture as it is practiced (not in theory) has been the fact that is often carried out with an indiscriminate focus on alien species and ignorance of the ecosystems native to the area that it is supposedly striving to work with rather than against. Your bamboo may be useful <i>to you</i>, but it an invasive weed that is harmful to native ecosystems. <br><br>I can't think of a square kilometer of this planet that would not benefit, ecologically speaking, from the complete elimination of all species from it that were introduced by humans. American ground sloths and camels are GONE. They cannot be replaced or even approximated by asian and african aliens. Our pleistocene ecosystems evolved with the presence of the american species, not the superficially similar old world animals. Do think you could "replace" mountain gorillas with humans? Coyotes aren't even proving to be a suitable "replacement" for wolves in the places where this substitution has happened, and these species are far more similar than elephants versus mammoths. Sure, we all would have loved to see the megafauna roaming the American steppes with our own eyes. But it ain't gonna happen. Gone. Forever. No way back. An elephant will never be a mammoth. All it will ever be in this continent is yet another foreign invader, adding to the disturbance of the continent's ecosystems, not somehow magically mitigating it. <br><br>Pleistocene rewilding needs to be tossed on the junk heap of really bad ideas quickly, before someone actually carries it out.<br><br>But I fear we are wandering way off topic here.<br><br><a href=adams-story-twilight-in-learyville.html#c4867132349131536227 title="comment permalink">6/3/07, 8:23 PM</a><br><br>

We may be off-topic, but not as far off-topic as you think. <br><br>I suspect there are things about which we will simply disagree, and I think invasion biology will be one of them. There is a “Mythic Narrative” aspect to invasion biology…from the outside, it looks like a “Golden Age” myth wrapped up in science which uses a lot of hyperbole and strident language; alien, invader, bad. <br><br>A question concerning timing; at what point does an introduced species become native?

As you so eloquently stated, an elephant is not a mammoth. It must be the Permaculture thing, but I see the extinct North American animals as unique, but the niches those animals filled as functional equivalents. It is a bad idea to introduce African species to the Great Plains…my support of it was mostly tongue and cheek.

Climates have always changed, and new species have always found their ways to islands and continents where they didn't exist before. The problem is when these processes start happening with unprecedented speed. Because of global human mobility, plant and animal species are being spread around the world at a phenomenal rate. This invasion of new species (much of which is happening incidentally and unintentionally) overwhelms many ecosystems. The results are a loss in regional differences, a reduction in biodiversity (a few aliens come to occupy the niche space that was formerly occupied by a wider array of natives), and a simplification of ecosystem structure and function. Simplified ecosystems are less resilient ones; think of the monoculture as the extreme example. <br><br>Of course, in the present world, the distinction between "natural" and "anthropogenic" is not a sharp line. A couple of examples... during the 20th century several species of old-world gulls spread westwards across the north Atlantic and are now firmly established here in the North America. So is this a "natural" expansion, because they flew here under their own power? Or is it an "anthropogenic" invasion, because human activities (like garbage dumping and commercial fishing) changed the environment and made it a better place to be a gull, hence their population increase and range expansion. Similarly, coyotes spread into the southeast in response to the opening and fragmentation of the landscape, and the elimination of the wolves that once lived here. So are they a native species, or an alien invader? They walked and swam here by themselves, but we made it a happy place for them to live. <br><br>What all these things do respresent is change. And because of human activities, change worldwide is happening faster now than in many many millenia; perhaps faster than ever before. Given this, doing something that will spin this whirlwind up even faster (like spewing old-world grazers all over the american steppe) seems to me to be clearly a bad idea. <br><br>vlad -- the arundinarias are some of my favorite native grasses. But they don't have the structural qualities of the most robust asian bamboos. You can grow bamboo (and a vast array of other non-native species) without having them turn into noxious weeds if you are mindful in selecting the species and in how you grow them. The problem is too many people who aren't so careful.<br><br><a href=adams-story-twilight-in-learyville.html#c3793160628698448228 title="comment permalink">6/4/07, 11:24 AM</a><br><br>

Otherwise, it is hard to explain how they (the trees) carried out their repeated northward and southward migrations with the pleistocene climate shifts. A Passenger Pigeon could eat a nut in Georgia and deposit it the next day in Illinois if, for instance, it got snagged by a Cooper's Hawk on its northward migration (the nut still being in the pigeon's crop, which the hawk would leave behind as offal). Mourning doves, on the other hand, don't each such large seeds, nor are they quite as much of a long-distance migrant. Mammals and gravity are only going to disperse these trees by at most a hundred meters or so per generation. And now, as we potentially face even more rapid climate change.. well, the pigeons are extinct. <br><br>Maybe rather that trying to reestablish the megafauna, we should be gathering nuts and acorns in the south and scattering them across the landscape hundreds of km farther north (and vice-versa; the interaction of rainfall and temperature shifts could easily make some species migrate southwards in spite of warmer temperatures... or eastwards, or westwards). But that has a whole nuther set of problems associated with it, in terms of carrying pathogens and pests. Such a quandry...<br><br><a href=adams-story-twilight-in-learyville.html#c7784681649682591729 title="comment permalink">6/4/07, 6:09 PM</a><br><br>
