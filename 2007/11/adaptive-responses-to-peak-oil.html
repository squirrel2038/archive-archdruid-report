One of the occupational hazards of writing a blog on the future of industrial civilization, I’ve discovered, is the occasional incoming missive from somebody with a plan to save the world. My inbox fielded another of those the other day. As worldsaving plans go, this one is relatively modest, and by no means entirely misguided.<br><br>My correspondent hopes to convince the American people, or at least some portion thereof, to resettle in largely self-sufficient villages of 5000 to 10,000 people, compact enough that nobody will need to own or use a car. Each village owns enough land around it to feed its population, using edible forest crops and the like as the basis for subsistence. There’s a good deal more; you can find the rest of the details on the <a href=http://villageforum.com/ >website</a> my correspondent recommended.<br><br>Taken in the abstract, this is a great plan, and I suspect that a fair number of my readers would be as pleased as I would to move into such a village. As usual, though, the devil is in the details, and it’s as ugly a devil as ever graced a medieval morality play. Like those theatrical devils, though, this one has his uses. A close look at why my correspondent’s plan won’t save civilization from peak oil makes a good introduction to a theme that will be central to most of the next year or so of <span style="font-style: italic">Archdruid Report</span> posts – the question of how to craft an adaptive response to the coming of the deindustrial age.<br><br>It’s a rich word, “adaptive.” In the jargon of evolutionary biology, it refers to anything that allows an organism to respond effectively to the demands of its environment. When the environment is stable, what makes an organism adaptive stays pretty much the same from generation to generation. When the environment changes, though, what’s adaptive can change as well, sometimes radically; genetic variations that would have been problematic under the old conditions become advantages under the new; if the shift is large enough, a new species emerges. This points up the other, dictionary definition of the word – according to my Webster’s Ninth, “showing or having a capacity for or tendency toward adaptation.”<br><br>Both these meanings have crucial relevance to the work ahead of us as industrial society skids down the far side of Hubbert’s peak. On the one hand, it’s crucial to find ways of living that are adaptive in the ecological sense – that is, well suited to the new reality of a world of scarce energy and hard environmental limits. At the same time, we won’t simply be landing plump in that new reality overnight, nor do we know in advance exactly what that new reality will look like, so it’s just as crucial to find ways of living that are adaptive in the dictionary sense – that is, capable of adapting to the unpredictable changes of a world in transition.<br><br>The problem with my correspondent’s plan is that it may be adaptive in one sense, but it’s not adaptive at all in the other. It seems quite likely that a network of largely independent towns with populations in the 5000 to 10,000 range might be well adapted to the human and natural environments of a deindustrialized world, though that’s a guess at this stage of the process. It’s the process of getting there that’s the difficulty.<br><br>Let’s look at the numbers for a moment. Assume a population of 8000 and an average of 4 persons per family, and you need 2000 new homes for the community. We’ll assume that these homes are cheaper than the median US home – say, $250,000 apiece on average. That gives you a startup cost of $500 million. Add to that the cost of community infrastructure – everything from water and electricity to a school, a library, and the like – not to mention the farmland surrounding the village, and you’ve roughly doubled your price tag to $1 billion.<br><br>Even if half your residents own their own homes now and can pay for their new housing out of their equity – not a likely situation in the midst of today’s housing crash and credit crunch – and all the residents put in a great deal of sweat equity in the form of unpaid labor building the village, it’s still going to cost a great deal. If you had 2000 families committed enough to the project to risk their financial future on it, it might nonetheless be possible to make it happen. Still, that’s a huge risk, and it’s made even larger by the fact that the new village is going to have to provide jobs for all its adult residents – part of the point of the exercise is that nobody owns a car, remember, so commuting to the nearest city is out.<br><br>Nor can the village’s inhabitants count on being magically transported to a deindustrial world, where they can simply harvest their edible forest crops and barter skills among themselves. For many years to come, they will have bills to pay – not least the costs incurred in setting up the village – and national, state, and local taxes as well. Will the new village be able to provide its residents jobs that will insure their financial survival? Many small towns in the same population range are failing to do that right now. Behind the attractive image of a self-sufficient village in the countryside, in other words, lies the hard reality of a $1 billion gamble for survival against serious economic odds.<br><br>That $1 billion gamble, furthermore, would at best only take 8000 people out of the automobile economy – few enough that statistical noise will cover any impact they might have on the larger picture. Imagine a program to take 10% of the US population out of the automobile economy instead; that’s the sort of scale such a program would need in order to have any measurable effect on the fate of industrial society. The price tag there would be around $3.8 trillion in direct costs, plus the huge indirect costs involved in abandoning or relocating 10% of the country’s existing housing stock, residential and community infrastructure, and so on. It would take years, and possibly generations, for the savings in petroleum costs to make up for the huge initial outlay, and if the program turned out not to work – if, for whatever reason, the world on the far side of Hubbert’s peak turned out not to be suited to villages of the sort my correspondent envisions – all that outlay would have been wasted.<br><br>Now my correspondent’s plan is far from the most extreme example of this kind of unadaptive thinking. The poster children here are the dwindling tribe of technology fans who believe that fusion power will save us if we only commit enough money to research. It’s been well over half a century since the first attempts to make a viable fusion reactor got under way, and the only working example in the solar system is still 93,000,000 miles away from Earth, rising in the eastern skies every morning as it turns hydrogen into helium at its own unhurried pace. We have absolutely no certainty that another trillion dollars of investment will get us any closer to commercially viable fusion power, and if the gamble fails, industrial society is left twisting in the wind with a great deal of empty space beneath its feet.<br><br>The problem shared by these, and so many other proposed responses to the predicament of industrial society, is that they aren’t adaptive in the second, dictionary sense. They bet the farm on a single strategy, and if that fails, there is no plan B. Such plans look good on paper, but that’s usually as far as they go, because the factors in the human and natural environment that would make them possible simply aren’t there. For some forty years now, for instance, people have been talking about village communities like the ones my correspondent described. Very few have even been started, fewer have been built, and the ones that have become viable communities can be counted on the fingers of one foot.<br><br>What sort of response to the emerging crisis of the industrial world would count as adaptive? We’ll be talking about that for quite a number of posts to come, but a few suggestions might be worth making at this point.<br><br>First, an adaptive response is <span style="font-style: italic">scalable</span> – that is, it can be started and tested on a very small scale, with a minimal investment of resources, and then expanded from there if it proves to work. A fusion reactor is not scalable; you either have one, after trillions of dollars of further investment, or you don’t. My correspondent’s village proposal is a good deal more scalable than this, but even so it’s impossible to give it a try without at least a few hundred families and quite a bit of money. What we need, by contrast, are responses that can start out with individuals committing only the money, resources and time they can easily spare.<br><br>Second, an adaptive response is <span style="font-style: italic">modular</span> – that is, it can be broken down into distinct elements, each of which functions on its own without needing the involvement of all the other parts. That allows something that doesn’t work well to be swapped out without disrupting the rest of the system; it also allows elements suited to one stage of the deindustrializing process to be replaced with something else when that stage gives way to another. Think of the difference between a machine and a toolkit. A machine either does the job or it doesn’t, and if the job changes, you usually have to replace the entire tool. If you have a toolkit, by contrast, the jobs that can’t be done with one tool can usually be done with another.<br><br>Third, an adaptive response is <span style="font-style: italic">open</span> – that is, it can be combined freely with other approaches to the challenges of the future and the enduring predicaments of human existence. None of us can know in advance what belief systems, socioeconomic arrangements, and lifestyle choices will turn out to be most adaptive at each stage of the decline of industrial society. Locking a response into one particular set of approaches limits its usefulness, and could lead people in the future to jettison valuable options because they have become too thoroughly entangled with a dysfunctional economic system or a discredited ideology.<br><br>These characteristics look back toward some of the issues already discussed in this blog, but they also open unfamiliar doors. As we peer through those doors in the weeks and months to come, it might be possible to glimpse something of what adaptive responses to the predicament of the industrial world might look like.

A good introduction to what should be a very interesting series of posts. So, do you feel that the UK (and spreading elsewhere) Transition Town movement is an example of the doomed-to-fail ecovillages you talked about, or a modular, scaleable approach. To me it is more like the latter in that the participants are not starting any capital works of construction, not abandoning their current jobs or homes, but simply innovating as the need arises plus some sensible anticipation.<br><br><a href=adaptive-responses-to-peak-oil.html#c101614798797463376 title="comment permalink">11/22/07, 12:21 AM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c3951717784018633896></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/08936125294516790391 rel=nofollow>The Less Deceived</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>As usual a post with some interesting ideas, lucidly argued. However, I would counter that you are not being adaptive enough in your assessment of how attitudes to housing might change.<br><br>A modern house costs $250k because people pay a builder to construct something prefabricated with vinyl siding, air conditioning, a fitted kitchen and an integral two-car garage. People are prepared to pay because the existing economic and environmental context makes it feel normal and even sensible to do so. On the other hand, if a family fleeing some urban dystopia is desperate for a home in a certain locale then they will (and must) live in anything they can get. They will not complain about the lack of a fitted kitchen. For the desperate even yurts and tipis are options but for a longer term solution it is possible that straw-bale housing will become popular.<br><br>A friend of mine built a straw-bale house partly on her own. She found plenty of volunteers to lend a hand. She needed that help and a mentor, largely because it has two stories and a fairly complex structure. However, a single-storey straw-bale house would need little more than a rammed earth and tyre foundation, bales for the walls, lime wash to weather proof the bales, and shingles for the roof. She has running water and electricity, with heating from a wood stove. She lives in a very rural area in the west of the UK where the weather is changeable but often wet (somewhat like Oregon, in fact) and the house is weatherproof and very snug. If it were not for the ‘honesty window’ you would not know it was a straw-bale house. <br><br>This then is genuinely affordable housing: the 400 or so bales themselves would probably cost no more than $500-600. A total $5k to $10k might be a reasonable figure for a basic house built completely with one’s own labour. No, it wouldn’t be luxurious but it would be a home that would protect its occupants in even the coldest winters - it would allow survival, in other words. The work would be hard but if multiple families in a particular location wanted houses then people would naturally gravitate towards cooperating with each other, lending their labour and being repaid in kind.<br><br>It can be done, as far as I can see, for a cost more than an order of magnitude lower than that you suggest. That, to my mind, is not the core issue. The issue is how long it would take for middle-class Americans to decide that they can accept living in such a dwelling. As of now, I would guess at 1% or less of the population. But in a society where personal transport is no longer affordable for the masses, food is scarce and urban law and order fading? A society where a rural village offers hard work but a stable food supply and personal security, with plentiful examples of straw-bale housing already in place to show what is possible? Well, that might be a different story. If we end up in such a society people will adapt or die.<br><br><a href=adaptive-responses-to-peak-oil.html#c3951717784018633896 title="comment permalink">11/22/07, 1:03 AM</a><br><br>

My guess is that they may do well. <br><br>Deceived, no argument there. There's nothing inherently wrong with the village as a settlement structure; the problem comes when you try to manufacture them according to a preconceived plan, rather than letting them evolve naturally out of changes in human settlement patterns. When refugees from the deserts of Georgia and the drowned cities of Florida build themselves simple homes of available materials on the prairies of postglacial Greenland, they won't be spending $250,000 a house to do so, and their villages may have a very good shot at survival.<br><br>A happy turkey (or tofu) day to all, by the way.<br><br><a href=adaptive-responses-to-peak-oil.html#c5106519676356512278 title="comment permalink">11/22/07, 1:13 AM</a><br><br>

It is a sad habit of Americans, and industrial peoples in general, to walk away from existing infrastructure as though it were a damaged toy. My city, like every other city in the US, has lost an enormous legacy of extraordinary and solidly constructed buildings to this "solution" mentality. If you look at the photographic record, you see a series of perfectly usable buildings demolished to make way for something mundane, no more useful than its predecessor, and usually far less beautiful.<br><br>It's just wasteful. It wastes embodied energy, labor, valuable materials, and a piece of history. And it throws more carbon into the atmosphere. I think the best solutions involve changing our minds, our perspectives, and our behaviors, which is probably why I like this blog. New construction is a developer's answer to post-industrial living. It's post-industrial thinking from a thoroughly industrial vantage.<br><br>Let me suggest that most of us are, in fact, already living in villages. My city neighborhood functions as a village, and my building as a smaller village within it. Human relations haven't changed so much that you can't reach out to your neighbors and start to live cooperatively, exchange favors, and look after each other in ways that the village scheme envisions. And suburbites can, I am sure, reorganize their social relations in similar fashion.<br><br>But of course, this doesn't involve any new toys, and you do have to accept the neighbors you've got. Let me just say that in my experience, the necessary mental shift pays far greater dividends than new construction.<br><br><a href=adaptive-responses-to-peak-oil.html#c6047457150051204264 title="comment permalink">11/22/07, 8:01 AM</a><br><br>

Would you be so enthusiastic if you and the people you care about were first in line? You might be, you know; the Four Horsemen don't play favorites.<br><br>Lizm, exactly. Working with existing infrastructure is adaptive -- in many cases, especially on your side of the country, it embodies valuable experience from the pre-fossil fuel age.<br><br><a href=adaptive-responses-to-peak-oil.html#c471801429504781248 title="comment permalink">11/22/07, 8:27 AM</a><br><br>

It is the factor that actually leads to the failure of most intentional communities. Let me tell you a story.<br><br>St. Johns was to be a Traditional Catholic Village in Pennsylvania. Centered around village church, the 200 or so homes were to be available for sale only to members of the sponsoring organization, the Third Order of St. John. Covenants restricted further sales only to other members. The church would offer only the Traditional Latin Mass, and the village would have no school of it's own. Instead, all the children would be bussed about 5 miles to a school run by the Society of St. John.<br><br>Money was raised, land was purchased, some 50 homes were ready to be built. A college was planned. It all looked to be going well. Then questions came up about the behavior of the head of the Society of St. John around high-school aged boys. No molestation was ever proved, but the admissions of activities just short of that (supplying alcohol to minors, nude massages, etc) led to the resignation of the head of the order, and revocation of his permission to function as a priest by the local bishop. He was later deported back to Argentina. A thorough audit of the books found a half-million dollars had been diverted to personal use by the priests.<br><br>Finally, the local bishop suppressed the order, seized their funds, and made sure they were returned to the original donors. The Third Order sponsoring the village was disbanded and the property sold. The Society have since re-organized in Paraguay, God help them.<br><br>Every (and I do mean every) intentional community movement I have examined closely has either collapsed or turned into a personal cult due to the failings of the leaders.<br><br><a href=adaptive-responses-to-peak-oil.html#c4602675490230126024 title="comment permalink">11/22/07, 10:25 AM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c2945592290676548828></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/17092263065191866809 rel=nofollow>guamanian</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Since I believe I am likely to live the rest of my life in a framework of 'semi-managed decline', I am often on the lookout for ideas that reflect your principles of "scalable, modular, and open", and also often look back in time for patterns that can be modified and re-used, given a few tweaks.<br><br>The ones I stumble upon this way are almost always 'bottom-up' instead of 'top-down' in design terms, and usually make some quirky use of an existing structure or system that will no longer work as originally intended in the decline phase. <br><br>Here are two ideas that I could see being adaptive to the early stages of descent. I don't offer them as solutions, but as small-scale thought experiments that might meet your criteria for adaptiveness:<br><br>1. Bio-truck Farms. Here in southern Ontario there are lots of industrial mixed-crop farms that include corn and other potential bio-fuel crops in the mix, all located within a short drive radius of our urban centres. We also have several small-scale bio-fuel experts working in the area. Combine these assets, and I could visualize a system where on-farm biodiesiel production drives the tractors and a couple of trucks to close the liquid fuels loop on the farm. The bio-trucks are then used to bring market produce to different neighbourhoods of the city for regularly scheduled markets, and also are used as 'flatbed busses' to bring labour back to the farm for a few days work on the return trip from the market, before returning us to the city for another market cycle. The overall pattern would create a biofuel-driven radiative flow of food and workers between cities and the neighbouring farms.<br><br>This might be a very useful way to use farm-brewed biofuels in energy descent. If a few farms tried it when the time is right, and it worked for them, adoption or adaptation by others would be natural, gradual, and not very capital intensive or disruptive. It would not even change farm ownership patterns much.<br><br>Historical templates exist for all aspects of the system: Vegetable farm trucks stopping regularly in neighbourhoods for tailgate sales were common in Canada 50 years ago. Migrant labour is already part of farming. Trucks used as rural busses for workers are common in Central America as in many other places. Farms growing feed for their own horses is a analogue for farms growing fuel for their bio-trucks. Even the recent invention of CSAs creates a template for 'our' neighbourhood supplying the labour for 'our' associated farms.<br><br>2. Burb-steading. For brevity, I'll just sketch this one: Given a little bit of creative dis-assembly and reconfiguration, four adjoining abandoned suburban houses become a one acre intensive vegetable farm with a super-insulated home, a barn/coop, and two concrete-lined fish ponds. (The foundations of the two disassembled houses.) The location on the city edge offers a ready market. Even the surplus windows become cloches for growing season extension.<br><br>I cheerfully acknowledge that both of these ideas are probably flawed and doomed to fail... but the approach of working creatively with what we already have, trying it, failing, learning, adapting, and trying something else will work just often enough to be our best way forward.<br><br><a href=adaptive-responses-to-peak-oil.html#c2945592290676548828 title="comment permalink">11/22/07, 1:34 PM</a><br><br>

I can only assume that the person who brought it to your attention was only very loosely using this model as a starting point for something much more diverse, much less expensive and much more self-sufficient. <br><br>For example, take the "local sustainable economy" concept the village folks are using. It's not really very local at all. When you go down the list, some of the requirements are that the village has "fast broadband and good transport links" and "access to airports and overnight shipping." The site also states a village will need to attract 2000 jobs for an economy of 100 million - that's an average of $50,000 per year per job, and all those jobs are supposed to be done from within the community. To accomplish this, a village using this blueprint will have to be a very-hand picked operation - attracting mostly well-heeled retired people, urban professionals who can telecommute to their big city corporate jobs, or folks who can relocate their well-paying entrepreneurial lifestyle to a village. That's a pretty darned small sub-section of the overall population. <br><br>Nor are the village folks even trying to be self-sufficient in food - they refer to the village as being a "major market for for the local farms." So, while hoping that some local farmers might decide to put the village on their delivery route is good, that means lots of inputs and outside infrastructure are still required to keep the village propped up and functioning - pretty much the same as any other city. Oh, and I also see no mention of where they plan to get their power - my guess is off the same grid as everyone else? <br><br>So what we really have here is a no-cars-allowed-inside, gated, high-input suburb of mostly hand-picked professional middle-income or higher individuals with <a href=http://villageforum.com/page7.html rel=nofollow>some pretty serious community covenants</a> to control who moves in. To my mind, definitely not sustainable in any sense of the word. Might be a nice place to live, depending on how well the other folks in the community behave, but it's still prone to the same oil and climate related problems as any other city. <br><br>(Btw, I had to laugh a little at the "using edible forest crops and the like as the basis for subsistence" part. I would love to see what the average person off the street would say when confronted with a plateful of "edible forest crops!")<br><br><a href=adaptive-responses-to-peak-oil.html#c7831259625851004951 title="comment permalink">11/22/07, 11:02 PM</a><br><br>

The other major GH effect gas is CH4, but it happens to be methane, the most efficient fuel available...<br><br>So, to me, as long as the global economy is driven liberalism, we are running into a grim present toward a dark future, that of extermination of most species on earth, including our own.<br>And even if we don't disappear, what will be left will never raise above the state of farmer.<br>It doesn't mean that we won't be able do destroy the environnment again, as transforming all possible soils into agricultural fields is a very efficient way toward pollution, extermination of species and eventual self-destruction.<br><br>Also, I don't believe humanity as a whole is capable of grasping the problem of environnment, climate change, peak oil and assimilating the cultural traits of moderation (notably in term of child number), respect of environnement and scientific way of proceeding that are required to survive in the long term.<br><br>I know that some people like you, JMG, and others, are trying to make an impulse toward this kind of society, by living in villages or some sort of tribal system, and adopt the cultural traits by settling them as a religion (that's how I understand modern druidism). But the shortcomings to this strategy are countless :<br>- the 6 billion people (soon 9) that want to reach the incongruous level of comfort american and european have enjoyed for 50~100 years and will also make the biggest part of future migrations (some of which practice public lynching every day or so, to denote the cultural gap)<br>- the geopolitical struggle for the last bits of fuel that has already begun in Iraq (I would call it the last world war, if I wasn't convinced it will only be the third)<br>- climate change will be accelerated because of the fore-mentionned attempt at other types of fuel.<br>- the climate change will make 99% of those villages dead, as they'll face floods, draught and food shortage. (meaning it requires lots of such villages for enough to survive)<br>- if the climate change is too strong (which I suspect will, for several scientific reason) people will die whether they are "environment-behaved" or not. So statically, it's lost again.<br>- the societies that have low birth-rate (it's a sustainable behavior) are also the ones that emit the most GH by head : Europe and North America.<br>- a lower birth-rate is a short-term insurance of losing in the struggle for survival, against competing high-birth rate populations.<br>- a society can't retain its cultural traits in the very long term.<br>The case of the birth-rate is very important, because a single population that has no control over it's growth (the growth being always near 0 % +/- ) eventually overwhelms all others. The expansion of European populations all over the world between the 14th and the 19th century is a good example, as we destroyed many local populations, like native americans.<br><br>It also means that mankind will follow a saw-teeth curve of population until it goes too high and then drop to zero (we may be on the last tooth). This a very frequent behavior in life simulations, however complex they are. It is a distinct feature of locusts populations.<br><br>That's it for this week, and I'm in a good mood !<br><br><a href=adaptive-responses-to-peak-oil.html#c1098364439459937675 title="comment permalink">11/23/07, 2:34 AM</a><br><br>

And I agree about the "adaptive" part. When energy becomes constrained, the economy will only be more constrained — and working with what's available will be the only way to go forward. Turn suburban houses into duplexes — people with less stuff won't need so much room anyway, and you cut your heating costs in half for the same number of people — and raze other houses for raw material or turn them into storage or businesses. Even the hard work part wouldn't be too onerous as long as there isn't some self-appointed "chief" who takes the profits and chats up the daughters while the parents are working.<br><br>But even old-style villages weren't completely self-contained. There were roads from one to the next, which carried commerce and information, and I would expect that an adaptive, sustainable village would develop some kind of sustainable industry to provide the people with necessities, luxuries, or trade goods.<br><br><a href=adaptive-responses-to-peak-oil.html#c4717581864254561353 title="comment permalink">11/23/07, 11:02 AM</a><br><br>

Having already critiqued the village project on other grounds, I didn't want to get into the fact that it's basically nouveau suburbia, but yes, it is. As for leaders and followers, one of our problems these days is that nobody wants to cooperate on any basis other than getting their own way all the time -- and that's not a recipe for a viable community. <br><br>Jonathan, I can't speak for all Druids, but no, I'm not trying to encourage people to become farmers and move to villages. I'm saying that as industrial civilization comes apart at the seams, farmers in villages will be most of what we'll have left, and we might as well act now to make the transition to a neo-agrarian society with as many of the benefits of the last three hundred years as possible. As for the sawtooth pattern you suggest, well, locusts are still around; the current situation is in many ways unique -- not least because it's only because of fossil fuels that the overpopulation of the last century has been possible at all -- and it's much more likely that human societies will return to the same much less drastic set of population cycles they had before the fossil fuel age once it's over.<br><br>Francisco, thanks for the link.<br><br>Farfetched, very much so. It's one of the common delusions of the modern world that the only alternative to industrialism is huddling in a cave somewhere.

My idealistic ~6-8 friends succeeded in buying a big house in the city and did full income sharing for about a year.<br><br>What they actually accomplished for that year, cohousing, seemed more promising than building up a exurb community, paying down student loans and credit cards faster than they could have as individuals, and they set up a workable set of household managers over: kitchen, housekeeping, maintenance, finances, etc.<br><br>I thought hard how their vision could make more sense to me and the vision I saw was more cohousing within urban neighborhoods. For me it all came down to debt - to do big things fast you have to take on a lot of debt, so I'd rather scavenge within the existing resources for easy pickings - perhaps renovating a poor neighborhood, or if you leave the city, find a small town in need of new blood and make some friends and see where you can make a difference.<br><br>I'll always look for incremental changes that move in a direction that I think I want to go, and reserve the right to change paths as circumstances and opportunities advance.<br><br>OF COURSE, that's how humanity got into this mess we have now - taking the easy road of cheap energy and now we have to face the costs of our choices which were not sustainable.<br><br>I'm sure there's times for revolution - where all smooth paths are unacceptable, but when you follow that path, you have to give up all hope that there's any road back to the life you left. Like Alexander's Army, burning their boats on a new shore of conquest. I suppose the burning times may yet come again!<br><br>Myself, I feel like I'm honoring the hard work of my parents and grandparents if I continue some of their work, build off their wealth. I MEAN I know I have a lot more spare time than they did, so that's a great gift. I'm not sure I'm willing to work as hard as the pioneers, and I'm not yet sure what direction I need to travel.<br><br>My own revolutions are closer to home - sometimes trying to convince friends and family that a bicycle is the most power means of transportation, and change is slow, but not all seeds grow fast, and I'm not ready to evangalize my mission quite yet.<br><br><a href=adaptive-responses-to-peak-oil.html#c5939033422913626908 title="comment permalink">11/26/07, 11:44 AM</a><br><br>

It implies that you have a "leader" mind-set, which is possibly why you've not examined the successful communities.

For the past hundred years or so, "standard of living" has been equated with "energy use."<br><br>There certainly should be other ways of defining a high standard of living, but they have to be invented before they can be raised. I'd suggest we not use the old terms to mean new ideas, because it is impossible to "raise the standard of living" of anyone in a finite world without reducing that of someone else, given the phrase's colloquial association with money (an illusion) and energy (in decline).<br><br><b>JMG:</b> I think you've been a bit harsh on Village Forum. From my involvement in the intentional communities movement, I think they're a bit naive and unrealistic, it's the right direction. You point out the immense costs of doing this sort of thing as though it would happen in a Soviet-style, centralized mandate.<br><br>However, I think this sort of thing is <i>inevitable!</i> If you accept the premise that the future is going to be more like the past as cheap energy goes away (and I think much of your writing reflects that belief), it's easy to see that pre-fossil fuel, much of humanity was organized around units larger than the family.<br><br>Call it a village, tribe, whatever, up until the beginning of the industrial revolution, as ushered in by widespread use of coal, people lived in groups of a few tens to a few thousands of people.<br><br>When energy became cheap enough so that energy slaves could take the place of common resources, the communal unit of choice devolved into the family, and it settled there for some time.<br><br>Now at the peak of energy use, the communal unit has become the Individual, with each of us expected to function with little or no input from persistent communal associations.<br><br>As energy declines, we'll see the necessity of larger communal units re-emerge. Children will cease to be the hobbies and luxuries of the energy rich, and will once again become an important labour source.<br><br>I think it makes a lot of sense to leap-frog the family, and strive to restore the communal group as the essential societal structure. For those who are dubious, we're all around you -- join in the fun, and work together with others for the future.<br><br>So please don't tell me how many zeros would have to be after the dollar sign -- to this degree, you and I agree that Village Forum is unrealistic to think people will voluntarily leave a comfortable place to start over.<br><br>What's more likely to happen is the classic <i>diaspora,</i> a mass relocation based on common forces. Some of us are old enough to have witnessed the last North American diaspora, when the cities and suburbs inhaled the people from the countryside as "fossil energy slaves" made toil on the land unnecessary for all but a few. This will simply be the reversal, a sighing exhalation from cities no longer capable of caring for burgeoning populations.<br><br>Before fossil energy, there were fifteen families working the land for every one living in a city. We should start planning for that again!

They are living, in an enviroment, "outside the box". Through generations, these people have passed on the skills required to become a somewhat substainable society. If, change comes slow enough and of those settlements that are isolated, can largly go undisturbed, they stand an excellent chance of survival.<br><br>However, we're talking about a religious sect here and might I add a very close knit bunch.

Its been created on a tried and tested basis through several decades of use around the world, and its wisdom has become distilled and itself is open to adaptable and reproducible new solutions. It’s the system most aligned with how nature works. You want to know what works for life on earth? Look to nature- it’s been at the game for billions of years!

Since we are talking about self-sustaining communities rather than households, I did a simple search for intentional communities with more than 100 children. It returned 11 hits, only 2 of which, both kibbutzim in Israel, could be described as a potentially self-sufficient intentional communities. <br><br>I will confess to not having studied kibbutzim much, as they seem to be very specific to Israel and not very exportable to other situations. <br><br>As for the rest, essentially they're cults. And yes, Guamanian, I'm quite aware of the The Farm, having been involved in the homebirth/midwifery movement back in the 80's and 90's. It's a cult too. <br><br>By far most of the smaller intentional communities listed at FIC are simple co-housing arrangements. Co-housing just doesn't cut it in terms of setting up an alternative structure to replace industrial capitalism. It's got no capacity for sustaining itself. It is merely another form of condominium, with less privacy and even more subordination to authority. I wouldn't even count them as communities.<br><br>Para-communities are such organizations as Catholic Worker's houses and Helping Hand Charitable Trust. They are communal, and of great value, but they are set up and function as charitable organizations, not as communities per se. <br><br>My point is this: a dozen commodities traders and programmers living in an oversized Victorian house in SF, or a thousand vegans worshiping King Yo as the incarnation of the Universal Spirit are not really going to alleviate the collapse of the industrial economy. Nor are they going to likely contribute much to the next phase of history. They are essentially extraneous to the discussion.<br><br>The other point (the one everyone seems to be missing) is that all such successful communities are based around religion, whether of a Buddhist, Mennonite, Doukhobor or Anabaptist bent. The communities themselves are rarely of the intentional "let's build a community" stripe, but rather of the "I'm ready to buy a house and some land, but I don't want to be too far from my co-religionists" style. Even more so with the monasteries, which are explicitly about NOT a self-sustaining community (celibacy and all), but rather about achieving salvation.<br><br>An interesting thing is happeining in a little town in Oklahoma, named Clear Creek. The traditionalist Benedictine Monastery at La Solemnes in France (you may have heard their CD <i><b>Chant</b></i>) has founded a monastery there. The monks have no intention of building a Catholic community in Oklahoma. Yet, that is what they are doing. Land prices have risen dramatically within a few miles of the new monastery as Catholics from other parts of the country move to Oklahoma in order to be nearby. <br><br>Well, I'm off to go cut more firewood.<br><br><a href=adaptive-responses-to-peak-oil.html#c4409685871200410078 title="comment permalink">11/27/07, 3:29 PM</a><br><br>

My next post will have some comments on these lines. <br><br>Guamanian, the Farm's an interesting example, with much to learn from on both sides of the balance. You're certainly right that it's one of the more successful of the species. <br><br>Ares, I'm a fan of the incremental approach, of course -- you don't burn your boats unless you have to.

They won't be self-sufficient, but then nobody is actually self-sufficient; local dependency, rather than complete autarky, is the theme that needs to be kept in mind. <br><br>Dwig, oh, granted -- my guess is that monasteries will make a very strong comeback. I've often thought that the Shakers make a good model for what an American monasticism could look like; more generally, people studying the possibility of intentional communities might take them as an example. There's still one Shaker community left up at Sabbathday Lake, Maine; the only thing that kept them from being a continuing presence in a larger way is a society in which celibacy and self-discipline are pretty much unthinkable. <br><br>Bytesmiths, I'm not at all opposed to the emergence of villages -- in fact I'm quite convinced that it's inevitable. Still, this will happen when human ecology supports it, and not before; nor will the resulting villages be pocket suburbs for the upper middle class. Once we no longer have the energy equivalent of 260 slaves working night and day to satisfy our cravings, we'll find out just how much work it really takes to support a given standard of living, and standards of living will drop accordingly. <br><br>TRB, one of the reasons I'm talking about the prospect of future ecotechnic societies is precisely because what you've called "the myth of reeling time backward" is so pervasive in our society. It's an article of faith in modern society that the only alternative to the acceleration of the status quo (aka "progress") is some past social system. That has to be countered with visions of a low-tech but innovative future. <br><br>Naresh, exactly -- these are among the reasons I think the transition town movement may do well. One of the things I like most about it is that it focuses on the concept of <b>transition</b> rather than trying to impose some rigid ideal on the flowing shape of human social interaction we call a community. <br><br>Jan, women had more rights in medieval and Elizabethan England than they did in Victorian England, when fossil fuels were coming in and the energy per capita was much higher. Fortunately, the sort of determinism that derives social forms from energy levels doesn't work in practice. <br><br>Dan, the word "cult" is a snarl word that simply means "a religion the speaker doesn't like." You're quite correct that most successful intentional communities have a religious focus -- whether that focus is one of the established religions or a new and thus unpopular religious movement is immaterial, except from a theological viewpoint (and of course the people you're dismissing as "cults" have as much right to their theologies as you have to yours). <br><br>As for their relevance to the future, well, the last time a major civilization in the Western world started down the track of catabolic collapse, one of the minor players in the religious landscape was this very unpopular minority religion that claimed an executed criminal was God incarnate. People dismissed it as a cult, too, and I'm quite sure that believers in Jupiter Optimus Maximus would have laughed at the thought that it might play any significant role in the future. As Rome declined, though, that "cult" ended up filling the void, and its intentional communities became crucial in preserving most of what we have left of classical culture. So it's unwise to dismiss King Yo and his followers out of hand!<br><br>Yooper, another way to look at Chefurka's figures is to imagine a town or neighborhood with 1000 people in it. If his calculations work out, that would be the equivalent of an extra 25 deaths in that town each year. For what it's worth, I think that's on the high side -- I expect it to take closer to a century for the bulk of population decline to work out -- but it's still a gradual process.<br><br><a href=adaptive-responses-to-peak-oil.html#c1598048165182737627 title="comment permalink">11/27/07, 6:18 PM</a><br><br>

Greenland cores suggest that temperatures worldwide shot up an average of 13 to 15 degrees F. in under a decade; in some areas close to the disintegrating ice sheets, the change was closer to 30 degrees F. Rain belts shifted, deserts spread, and a lot of species adapted to ice age conditions died out.

I don't mean to snarl. <br><br>My point about cults and cultic intentional communities is this: If I'm looking for a way to ride out the next 50 years of dislocations and collapse, I'm not going to start worshiping King Yo in order to do so. No serious, intellectually honest person would or could.<br><br>If you believe in King Yo, by all means worship him, but to try to use his cult as a pattern for how to organize a community that <i>doesn't</i> believe in King Yo is irrational. The central fact of the cult of Yo is that it <i>is</i> the cult of Yo. This fact will be expressed in everything from it's architecture and art to sexual ethics to the structure of economic arrangements and the division of labor. The reasons those patterns work is most likely because the members have internalized the, if you will, Yo-ness of the arrangements.<br><br>Attempting to copy them will likely result in a serious inability make them work. It's also likely to result in either serious personal conflict or serious exploitation, given the surrender of individual will that is typical in cultic communities.<br><br>As an example, let us excuse the Yo-ites for a minute and invent a cult, called the Zeds. In the Zed community, women are required to serve in the temple brothel one day each month. I can think of a lot of reasons that this arrangement would be very efficient and resolve many issues in any community. It depends, however, on a generalized view of women as chattel. This view must also be internalized by the women themselves. The effects of this arrangement would spill over into all other areas of the community, in ways that would not be immediately apparent. To attempt to pattern your new community after the Zedite community, even without the temple prostitution, would likely result in failure.<br><br>The thrust of the argument, which I failed to actually make previously, is not that cults are stupid and therefore doomed, but that cultic communities depend primarily on the cultus to give them structure and more importantly, meaning. As similar as a Buddhist and a Catholic monastery may be in externals, the interior life of the members is exceedingly different. Both depend on the religion to give them purpose, meaning and structure. That the structure is similar is striking, but the dissimilarity in purpose and meaning even more so. You could not build a Christian monastery based on a Buddhist one, nor a Buddhist monastery based on a Christian one. Attempting to copy the structure of a cultic community without the cultus is asking to fail.<br><br><a href=adaptive-responses-to-peak-oil.html#c2290063012121691963 title="comment permalink">11/28/07, 7:04 PM</a><br><br>

M. Greer and M. Simon.<br><br>To each of you, I say: You have a great point, but you're missing or ignoring something very important about the other's argument. The result is practically no communication at all.<br><br>Specifically, to Greer: Simon was trying to tell you that unlike, say, the "hydrogen economy" or photovoltaics or the Tokamak, this *isn't* a vague specter of a "fix" that will be dangled in front of our society for decades, always just beyond reach. Simon says in "6 to 9 months" either we know or we don't. Either Simon's hope is vindicated on this one or not. To presume he'll lose this bet of reputations in advance is horrifically cynical. History does change unexpectedly sometimes, famously so when sub-atomic physics gets involved...<br><br>And, to Simon: The mere possibility of an end to our recent string of ever-bigger energy grabs obviously merits intellectual attention. Greer, and the broader school of thought he's part of, don't say their scenario is certain nor inevitable. They are simply not sure whether our ingenuity will actually be sufficient to keep up the pace. And of course they're not sure--since after all, we're talking about things that have not yet been invented! So given this ridiculous uncertainty, it's wise to consider many possible futures.<br><br>To sum up, in a world of very high future uncertainty and risk (e.g. our modern world), it is essential that we condone all reasonable ways to tackle the future. We *need* everything from careful contingency planning of the sort that Greer &amp; Co are doing, to creative invention of the sort that Simon &amp; Co are advocating and the IEC community is doing right now. I applaud both of you.<br><br><a href=adaptive-responses-to-peak-oil.html#c9040528750139661189 title="comment permalink">12/1/07, 11:42 AM</a><br><br>

While I agree that the challenges of adapting to post-peak oil are significant, I feel like many of the comments imply that oil will suddenly run out. <br><br>My understanding is that the demand destruction will occur each year production declines. Resulting in increasing pain, punctuated by periodic recessions that reduce economic activity, thus reducing energy use.<br><br>Sure, the world 50 years from now will look substantially different (I'm guessing no more SUV's), but unless there is a sudden supply disruption, why wouldn't we see what normally happens when housing costs are higher? A movement towards cheaper housing?<br><br>For example, converting McMansions into apartments, or re-population of inner cities. Certainly an individual in downtown boston that doesn't own a car, walks to work, and whose kids go to local schools is using less energy then I am (where I've got to drive to blow my nose).<br><br>My living costs increase. My kids leave, they move into inner cities (because they can afford it), Eventually I follow (because I want to be around grand kids).<br><br>I think the same will happen with autos. People stop buying SUV's, they buy smaller cars, perhaps hybrids. Demand destruction only occurs fast enough for supply to match demand at a stable price.<br><br>Finally, for those who are concerned about the hordes of food less, homeless, masses sweeping across the country in search of post-apocalyptic food supplies, I would suggest that America will ignore global warming and burn whatever amounts of coal it needs to to prevent that from happening.<br><br>Think twice before preaching the coming nightmare. You may create a self-fulfilling prophecy. As a normal, middle class, american voter, if I'm scared of peak oil/energy, why would I vote down that new coal-fired power plant being built down the road. At least I'll have electricity to keep my house warm, and keep my work running.<br><br>Mike<br><br><a href=adaptive-responses-to-peak-oil.html#c2135861359777394750 title="comment permalink">12/2/07, 6:48 PM</a><br><br>
