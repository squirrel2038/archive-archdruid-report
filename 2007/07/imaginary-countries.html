You might not expect it from a college town where public nudity is legal and the Republican Party hasn’t had a significant presence in thirty years, but the Fourth of July is a big deal in the small Northwest town where I live. This year’s parade was grand as always, with enough marching bands and colorful floats to satisfy anyone’s taste for pageantry, and a couple of jet fighters from the local Air National Guard base added an unexpected note of realism to this celebration of a revolutionary war by carrying out mock strafing runs over the crowd. As I type these words, barbecue smoke is rising from backyards all over town, and a few blocks east of my home the technicians are putting finishing touches on the evening’s fireworks display.<br><br>There’s a certain comforting solidity in a festival that’s been celebrated in the same way since well before I was born. If this year’s celebration is shot through with worries about the future and a bitter ambivalence about martial symbolism during an unpopular war, the same things were true of the Julys of my childhood, when the undeclared war du jour was in Vietnam rather than Iraq and a different generation of demagogues mouthed the same slogans that fill the talk shows today. Still, with the ten volumes of Toynbee’s <span style="font-style: italic">A Study of History</span> weighing down the shelf above me like the headstones of dead civilizations, it’s hard not to remember that the apparent solidity of old customs in a changing world can turn out to be as deceptively fragile as lake ice in the springtime.<br><br>In last week’s <span style="font-style: italic">Archdruid Report </span>post I suggested that from the point of view of history, nations are fluid and fragile things, and plans for the future that take their stability for granted are likely to end up in history’s recycling bin sooner than most. In many parts of the world this observation would not even have to be made, since borders have changed and nations have appeared and disappeared within living memory. Here in America, by contrast, it hasn’t even begun to find its way into the national conversation about the future. <br><br>The closest thing you’ll find to it is the suggestion, kept alive by the memory of our nation’s only civil war so far, and trotted out now and again for shock value, that the United States might someday split up into two or more still recognizably American nations. The possibility that the current borders of the United States might be the high water mark of an American continental empire, one whose tide is already turning from flow to ebb, remains all but unnoticed. The possibility that a century from now the United States might be a much smaller nation with no bigger role in international affairs than, say, Italy, is practically unthinkable. History shows that this sort of change happens all the time, but it seems very hard for Americans to apply a historical perspective of this kind to their own national community.<br><br>There’s a complex history behind this notion of American exceptionalism. Before the <span style="font-style: italic">Mayflower</span> brought the first shipload of Puritan refugees across the Atlantic, the idea that European settlement in the New World might be exempt from the sordid details of the Old World’s history was already in the air. The first Rosicrucian manifesto, which ignited a continent-wide furore on its publication in 1614, promised cryptically that “there shall be a door opened to Europe” and that “Europe is with child and will bring forth a strong child;” the German Rosicrucian sects who settled in Pennsylvania in the late 17th and early 18th centuries were far from the only people to apply these prophecies to the newly discovered lands across the ocean. <br><br>These habits of thought were sealed into place when the revolutionaries of 1776 chose to define their struggle for self-determination against English colonialism in the radical language of the Declaration of Independence. The ideals enshrined in the document whose signing we celebrate today had already been put into circulation during the English revolution more than a century before, and went nowhere; the restoration of Charles II to the British throne in 1660 drew a line beneath Britain’s brief experiment with Republican government. When those same ideals became the foundation of a lasting political settlement on American soil, the idea that America might go its own way, unburdened by the Old World’s troubles, became an article of faith for many Americans.<br><br>The problem with this comforting faith, of course, was that history failed to play along with it. It’s one thing to talk of westward expansion and manifest destiny, and quite another to come to terms with the wars of conquest and extermination that cleared the continent for America’s growth. Equally, it’s one thing to discuss the Monroe Doctrine as a matter of guaranteeing the freedom of the New World against the Old, and another to notice that in practice, too often, this amounted to a guarantee that the United States and not some other power would force its will on the nations of Latin America. Like every other country on earth, the United States faced its share of conflicts between its own ideals, on the one hand, and the demands of power, prosperity, and survival in the brutal world of international politics, and like every other country on earth, the United States made its share of wretchedly bad decisions in response.<br><br>When a gap opens up between ideals and reality, the result is what psychologists call cognitive dissonance, and America has a very bad case of it. A great deal of American political debate over the last half century or so has accordingly focused on trying to relieve the cognitive dissonance of America’s inevitable failure to live up to the high ideals on which it was founded. On the one hand, mostly but not exclusively on the political and social right, you can find loud claims that America’s moral failures either didn’t happen or don’t count, and that the ideals ought to be taken as an description of the way the United States actually behaves in the world. On the other hand, mostly but not exclusively on the political and social left, you can find equally loud claims that America’s moral failures not only cancel out anything worthwhile our nation has done, but prove that the ideals themselves are a sham.<br><br>These two claims, the Tweedledum and Tweedledee of American political rhetoric, have become so pervasive these days that very few people seem to notice either the bankrupt logic that drives them both, or the disastrous disconnection from reality that they both foster. The reasoning they share in common is the logic of Utopia, the claim that the right political, economic, or social system can make people behave like angels, and that anything less is therefore unacceptable. Conservatives who want to say that the American system works well thus end up arguing that it’s perfect, and radicals who want to point out that it has problems thus end up denouncing it as evil incarnate. Once the logic of Utopia enters the picture, the possibility of middle ground vanishes, and with it goes the potential for the compromise and cooperation that the founders of the American political system, pragmatists that they were, saw as essential.<br><br>This is disastrous enough, but to my way of thinking, the second consequence of the flight from cognitive dissonance may prove to be much worse as America stumbles into an age in which cheap fossil fuels become a thing of the past. To insist that America is by definition the world’s best society, inevitably destined to triumph in its disinterested pursuit of democracy around the globe, is to give up citizenship in the real world and move to a country as imaginary as Oz. To insist on the precise opposite of these claims is to do exactly the same thing. Neither set of beliefs would provide anything in the way of useful guidance even if America and the world could count on relative stability over the next century or so. In a world facing a long and difficult transition to sustainability on the far side of Hubbert’s peak, trying to impose the geography of imaginary countries on the real world will most likely prove suicidal.<br><br>It probably needs to be said that worshiping America as Utopia is not the same thing as patriotism. It’s not even a useful substitute. Apply the same logic to marriage – which is, after all, simply another form of social organization – and the fallacy becomes plain. Insist that your own marriage is already the best possible marriage, that its problems either don’t exist or don’t matter, and that for that reason there’s no need to discuss making changes, and drastic marital problems are pretty much a given. Respond to social troubles in the same way and you make an explosion inevitable. Equally, though, if you insist that your own marriage is so uniquely bad that marrying anybody else at all would be an improvement, your chances at marital bliss are no better, and the same is just as true in the world of politics; those who insist that American empire is the worst of all worlds might want to consider what would have happened if the Soviet Union had won the Cold War.<br><br>What makes all this pursuit of imaginary countries embarrassing from the historical point of view is that of all the revolutionary ideologies of the last few centuries, the one that shaped America’s institutions is one of the least congenial to extreme claims. You’ll find few political documents in all of history as riddled with caution, compromise, and wiggle room for necessary change as the American constitution, precisely because the unlikely radicals in Philadelphia whose act we celebrate today were profoundly aware of the power of political passions and the fallibility of institutions. That very fact makes their handiwork all the more relevant in a future when caution, compromise, and wiggle room will be desperately needed. The fact that the system they designed was also crafted to fit the measured pace of transport and communications in an age before fossil fuels points to another reason why the old pragmatic rules of the founding fathers may just turn out to be more relevant to the real world of tomorrow than to the imaginary worlds of today’s political rhetoric.

Far too many people have no idea what a joke and a failure statist Communism, at least on the level of industrial society, truly was. Yes, China is doing pretty well for itself, but they developed their industrial infrastructure in a way that allows for some real market activity. If they hadn't, stuff made there would be about as desirable to buy in the developed world as the junk churned out by the USSR's "socialist industry" was. (But even so, China's central planners are showing the same Communist reckless disregard for ecological health that turned Russia, Belarus, the Ukraine, and Eastern Europe into a virtual toxic-waste dump.)<br><br><a href=imaginary-countries.html#c4923526887902508382 title="comment permalink">7/5/07, 10:14 AM</a><br><br>

See for example Carolyn Merchant's _Reinventing Eden_. Planning for lower levels of resource consumption is often seen as un-American. <br><br>While the USA is often imagined as utopia, the exact utopian vision varies significantly. Maybe the biggest split is between the Puritans and the Locke-Voltaire-Paine Enlightenment thinkers. But even this isn't right. Somehow William Penn did not create a Quaker utopia as totalitarian as the Massachusetts of the Puritans. <br><br>There is also the liberal environment of Emperor Rudolph II in Prague. This seemed not to be anti-religious like Voltaire or Paine. I think the Amish come to the USA out of the collapse of the diversity supported by Rudolph.<br><br>Even if many fundamentalists are against Darwin and thus against science at some level, this hardly makes them against technology. For example, there are the folks that promote nuclear weapons and their use as a way to help bring about the apocalypse. <br><br>Anyway, the utopian vision of what the USA is or stands for is not just political, but also technological. "We are the most advanced country on earth." True or not, it seems to be dogma.<br><br><a href=imaginary-countries.html#c8045440010034805629 title="comment permalink">7/5/07, 12:12 PM</a><br><br>

One of the eye-openers when I visited Britain in 2003 was the extent to which the US is a technologically backward country; the household technologies I encountered in the homes of British friends were a generation or so in advance of ours.

That is, on imagining a "better" world and then forcing it on other people. <br><br>That way, we could focus on keeping alive the best aspects of the democratic tradition, in which I include utopianism -- "imagining something better" -- as I understand the term, but without the "forcing it on others".<br><br><a href=imaginary-countries.html#c6830317867091675262 title="comment permalink">7/6/07, 12:04 AM</a><br><br>

I wish I could say that I believed the majority of our fellow citizens were capable of handling that sort of change.

There's a scene where the officer (Roy Sheider)is advised by Richard Dreyfuss's character that they have spotted the shark. And the advice is 'Don't cause any panic' because this frenzy will excite the shark. So of course the 1st thing that the life guard does is to start blowing his whistle and screaming....<br><br><i><b>I'm afraid that if any of these changes were to be seriously implemented by those in charge, we would see panic, economic collapse and major social unrest.</b></i><br><br>I don't see an organized demand destruction happening probably for many of the reasons you cite. But if the writings on the wall. <br>And consequences are very real not enough oil and energy then big problems. So if you don't see a o.d.d. then anticipate them trying to secure fort knox and impose martial law. <br><br>If Katrina is the best example of how government functions in a crisie. Need I elaborate?<br><br>So its back to those individuals who look out and think that they see this as being the future. To put their 2 cents together and spend money and labour towards that end of increased self sufficiency. <br>Root cellars don't build themselves, gardens don't improve without labor. <br><br>In sci-fi stories there are rules layed out as to what is and what is not allowed in the fictional world. You can only use the transporter if you're within 2 sectors of a black hole for example. Well if we start hitting negative feedback loops or other nasty environmental consequences because we have failed to address our war on nature. (and we know who will win this battle) <br> Then this may severely alter the very real constraints on what is possible. <br><br>Local food means vulnerability to crop failure. Which was in the past onveniently downloaded onto to the backs of farmers with the advent of refridgerated trucking. Now that big agricorporations are involved how many times do you think they'll invest thousands of dollars in seed and fuel and labor to see certain failure? Others have pointed out that the current screw the grandkids agricultural model that confers disease by way of nutritional deficiency does not handle weather extremes well. And the only way we are going to get organic matter levels high enough is with time and proper farm practice. But that luxury does not exist in the b.a.u. (business as usual) world.<br><br> Similarly deciding that we need more trees to sequester carbon/ filter air/ shade the ground/ provide wind diversion etc. Won't mean a hill of beans if you plant some saplings that need 50 years growth in order to provide the now necessary benefits of those trees.<br><br>To end on a positive note. If you can't get all that junk food trucked from timbucktoo and pharmaceutical drugs and you get lots of exercise working for your food. Then your lifespan will no doubt increase.<br><br><a href=imaginary-countries.html#c1429073208165133191 title="comment permalink">7/9/07, 1:40 AM</a><br><br>

Everything else is just rearranging the deck chairs. We WILL be altering demand, it's just a matter of whether we do it without conscious choice.

Have you read this? http://www.dieoff.org/page150.htm<br><br>I think the framers of the Constitution did well in their time frame, but the only natural right we have is the right to Try to Live. Everything else is statutory and we need to remember that civilization and society are just an agreement between the individual and the group to behave according to the group's structure. When the group fails to uphold its part of the bargain (the most good for the most members <i>for the LONGEST TIME</i>), then the individuals have to rebel. This can take the form of new groups or anarchy. <br>Did the USSR actually lose the Cold War? OR did they simply move into Descent before us? In the very long term view, Russia is in a much better position with fewer people, fewer promises that cannot be fulfilled, and less dependence on technological overhead. Most of the 'work' and 'production' done in this country is for useless reasons. <br><br>loveandlight: We see the junk turned out in the Soviet Union as the inevitable result of Communism, but what if they had simply used their scientists from the space and weapons programs to build computers, cars, and social infrastructure for themselves, instead of to compete with our ludicrous military machine? Competition isn't all it's cracked up to be in our blind faith view of Capitalism. The desire to reach a goal is what produces better products. Competition by multiple producers simply wastes resources. We all know how things can be made better, but we let the accountants decide. In the USSR, those accountants worked for the Politboro. Here, they work for the IRS and the tax cheats.<br><br><a href=imaginary-countries.html#c8665080540689271858 title="comment permalink">7/9/07, 5:46 AM</a><br><br>

If you can't get all that junk food trucked from timbucktoo..."</i><br><br>Synchronicity! I was perusing the grocery store ads today, and had some of the same thoughts. It's amazing how much of the stuff sold as food in the typical grocery store is really just overpriced, over-processed junk. But I'm sure that as much as it's been handled, it's got a really high profit margin by the time it gets to those grocery store shelves. And with most folks' susceptibility to marketing blandishments, I'm sure they sell a lot of it. I pity the families that live off that crud, tho.<br><br>But what this means is that you could probably eliminate 80% of the so-called food stuffs from your typical grocery store and still have enough variety to eat like a king compared to most of the rest of the world. Or would the "real food" be what disappears while the junk is what ends up staying on the shelves? Real food probably has a lower profit margin and a higher turnover rate due to spoilage. So who knows. More good reasons to grow at least some of your own and set up a local supply chain, imo.<br><br><a href=imaginary-countries.html#c5401805097315106088 title="comment permalink">7/9/07, 2:48 PM</a><br><br>

It is junk as the industrial agribusiness nutritional profile is very poor. <br><br>They can not produce high quality food as they count on commercial fertilizers. Which places an upward limit on the achievable brix score.<br>see highbrixgardens.com<br>You can test the nutritional quality of your food with a refractometer. (measures %sucrose by weight) turns out that there is a correlation co-efficient of 1 when comparing the natural sweetness of food and its nutritional profile. With the caveat that g.m.o.'s may be able to bypass this natural corelation and some mineral profiles in the soil for example the sweet vidalia onions are so because of low sulfur content of the soil where they are grown.<br><br>So plant the garden also for your health and ammend the soil to achieve high brix values.<br>Now there's a concept investing in the future quality of your land!<br><br><a href=imaginary-countries.html#c1430819979842811213 title="comment permalink">7/10/07, 11:46 AM</a><br><br>

Whether you are referring to US rooters or US bashers, I think the gist of the issue is to keep in mind the basic difference between the American Revolution, the ideals that Jefferson &amp; co. embraced, and today US empire. I don`t know if you have ever surfed www.antiwar.com, a libertarian site which often works on this matter. They draw a fascinating parallel between the US and ancient Rome. Basically they claim that your republic was founded on the same fear of tyranny, and the same delicate balance of powers, that the Roman republic was, and that the Congress was devoid of real power after WWII, just as the Roman senate became a meaningless chamber in the days of Augustus. I guess it is simply impossible to keep true democracy alive when a country grows too succesful. <br>I hope you don`t mind if I mention a different topic here. Have you ever read "De Re Military", "On the Army" by Flavius Vegetius? It is a strange book, written in the days of Theodosius. The author is concerned about the decline of the Empire and writes a handbook where he pathetically compiles the old recipes for military success that worked in the days of Julius Caesar, in a vain attempt to reverse time. What I mean is, Romans actually noticed that their empire was in decline, it is only that not the sack of Rome was the turning point, but the battle of Adrianopolis instead.<br><br><a href=imaginary-countries.html#c5813552591079749015 title="comment permalink">7/12/07, 1:40 AM</a><br><br>

This is with or without a "decline" or a "collapse" of industrialism.<br><br>Hardly anyone in the U.S. today would question the idea that Italians and Irish (for example) are "white", but they didn't used to be considered so. Since racial categories are based on perception and cultural constructions they will continue to be malleable. In fact, race as we know it was only invented in the 17th century.<br><br>More to your point, I heard an interview with Tim Wise and Damali Ayo in which they suggested that in the future more groups -- including Latinos -- will eventually be included in "whiteness". But they expected that blacks will still not be let in to the definition of this "norm". (See episode 1 at; http://www.lipmagazine.org/looselip/ )<br><br>Since this blog talks about myths and stories, I would say that one of the primary myths of the United States is the notion that (1) there is a scientific and objective way to classify humans according to a quality called "race", (2) that this distinction *essential* (in the sense of a true, core "essence") differences between groups of people, and (3) that these categories are ancient and unchanging. None of these things is true, but as we all know, the stories we tell ourselves still shape our behavior even if those stories are completely at odds with reality. And this is why racist attitudes and behaviors are still with us even after people should know better.<br><br><a href=imaginary-countries.html#c5490975335172918782 title="comment permalink">7/12/07, 6:36 AM</a><br><br>

A good discussion, to which I'll add only two brief notes. <br><br>Yooper, since there's no such thing as a "white race" now, I don't see any way to discuss the future of this nonexistent thing! If you want to know whether some people in the future will still have skins on the pinkish end of the human spectrum, good question. I don't pretend to know enough about genetics to answer it. <br><br>Asturchale, there are various ways to talk about the way the US has run off the rails in the last half century or so; my own take is that it's been the collapse of civil society, the networks of voluntary social organization that made democracy work, that pushed us over the edge. As for Vegetius, I've read him but not recently -- thanks for the reminder! In later posts here I want to start talking about how civilizations fall in somewhat more general terms, and he's a useful resource.<br><br><a href=imaginary-countries.html#c5950069681118664159 title="comment permalink">7/15/07, 1:18 AM</a><br><br>
