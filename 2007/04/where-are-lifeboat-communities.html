Since the first serious doubts about the long-term survival of industrial society began to surface in the second half of the twentieth century, one of the most frequently repeated proposals for doing something about the situation has been the building of lifeboat communities: isolated, self-sufficient settlements stocked with the resources and technology to survive the end of the industrial age. Such Seventies classics as Roberto Vacca’s <span style="font-style: italic">The Coming Dark Age</span> discuss such communities in detail, and these discussions have been picked up and expanded substantially over the half-decade or so since the limits to growth have come back into sight in the form of peak oil.<br><br>It’s a plausible notion, and it has the advantage of a solid historical parallel to back up its claim to viability. During and long after the fall of the Roman Empire, Christian monasteries served as living time capsules in which many of the treasures of classical culture stayed safe through the centuries. Buddhist monasteries filled the same function in Japan’s feudal age, and Buddhist and Taoist monasteries took turns doing the same thing through China’s repeated cycles of imperial boom and bust. It’s by no means implausible that some similar project could salvage the best of modern civilization as a legacy to future ages.<br><br>Yet it’s curious to notice that all the current talk about lifeboat communities has yet to result in much in the way of action. I know of several groups that are seriously trying to put together the money, people, and other resources to make such a project happen, and doubtless there are others canny enough to pursue such a project without informing archdruids or anyone else about it. For the vast majority of people who talk about lifeboat communities, though, talk is as far as it goes. It would be easy enough to dismiss this as just another example of the common human habit of saying one thing while doing something much less impressive, and doubtless that has a good deal to do with it, but I’m convinced there’s more going on here.<br><br>Partly, of course, it’s that the same sort of disconnect between talk and action pervades every cranny of the question of industrial society’s future. In discussions about peak oil or any other aspect of the crisis of industrial society you care to name, people routinely bring up abstract possibilities as though the mere invocation of their names is enough to banish our problems. Solar power, or biofuels, or nuclear fusion, or breeder reactors, or, gods help us, “free energy devices” (the current incarnation of perpetual motion) will take care of the problem, I’ve been told time and again by people who are doing nothing whatsoever to make any of these things happen. On the other side of the equation, I’ve been lectured nearly as often about the evils of civilization and the inevitability of a return to hunter-gatherer economies by people whose utter lack of physical conditioning and basic wilderness skills guarantee them a quick and messy death if they ever follow their own advice and take to the wilderness. <br><br>Wish-fulfillment fantasy plays a much greater role in today’s debates about the survival of industrial society than most participants in those debates may want to admit, and the lifeboat community concept is no exception. How many science fiction novels, movies, and TV programs over the last fifty years have centered on some isolated community of survivors heroically rebuilding the world in the aftermath of some global catastrophe? Like it or not, all of us have such images moving through the crawlspaces of our minds, and it’s important to keep an eye on their potent gravitational attraction as we try to sort out fantasies from realities about the future.<br><br>This is particularly true in the present case, because the lifeboat community concept has extraordinarily deep roots in American culture. From colonial times on, groups of disaffected people from all corners of the religious, political, and intellectual continuum have set out to build communities in the wilderness, and very often a core element of their motivation was a conviction that apocalypse was close at hand. A direct line of cultural continuity runs from the Rosicrucian communes of colonial Pennsylvania straight through the Transcendentalists, the Mormons, the Sixties counterculture, and every other band of American dreamers who convinced themselves that a better world could be reached by the simple expedient of heading out into the Territories like Huck Finn and building it themselves.<br><br>From this perspective, peak oil – and indeed the whole contemporary crisis of industrial civilization – is simply one more excuse for disaffected Americans to dream about doing what their equivalents have dreamed about doing for the last three centuries or so. That the dream so rarely translates into attempts to make it a reality, though, has a tolerably simple explanation, and its name is the Sixties. Many people alive today remember what happened when large numbers of white, middle-class young people left the urban centers where the counterculture had its roots and tried to build a new society in communes scattered across rural America.<br><br>It was a grand experiment but, on the whole, a failed one, and the root cause of its failure is instructive. Of the many thousands of young communards who headed back to the land, vanishingly few of them had the least idea how much sheer hard work it takes to grow one’s own food and provide the other necessities of life by one’s own efforts, and not many more had even the most basic skills needed to tackle that technically complex and demanding task. A little pottering around in garden beds with a copy of a half-read book in one hand won’t do the trick. Idyllic fantasies of living the good life in the lap of nature thus collided head on with the hard reality that life in a fossil-fueled industrial economy really is much easier than subsistence farming in Third World conditions. Caught in this collision, most of the communes of the Sixties either figured out how to batten off the larger society through welfare, drug dealing, or some other sideline, or simply let out a few bubbles and sank once the first bright rush of idealistic enthusiasm wore off.<br><br>The same challenge faces potential lifeboat communities in a world perched unsteadily on the brink of peak oil. Anyone who wants to pursue rural self-sufficiency needs to check their desire for a modern American lifestyle at the door, and embrace a standard of living fairly close to that of a Third World peasant. Given competent training, rigorous practice, and a high tolerance for hard physical labor day in and day out, a group of healthy adults can keep themselves and their dependents adequately fed, clothed, housed, and equipped with necessary tools, with a little left over for barter or sale; for thousands of years this has been the standard human lifestyle over most of the world, and once the brief era of fossil-fueled extravagance we call modern industrial civilization is over, it will likely be the standard human lifestyle once again. Compared to the relative ease, comfort, opportunity and abundance of a modern middle-class lifestyle, though, the lot of a subsistence farmer is fairly hard going. <br><br>If the industrial world faced the sort of quick linear decline imagined by so many pundits of the Seventies and the present day, the transition from a modern lifestyle to a sustainable one would be much easier. Faced with the certain loss of familiar comforts and a future getting steadily worse than the present, many people could come to terms with the difficulties of subsistence farming and learn to enjoy the acquired taste of its pleasures. As I suggested in last week’s post and elsewhere, though, this luxury isn’t one we can count on. <br><br>Instead, the most likely course for the decline and fall of industrial civilization is a cyclic process, in which periods of respite and partial recovery punctuate the downward curve that leads into the dark ages of the deindustrial future. The cycles of sustainability outlined in last week’s post pose a daunting challenge for potential lifeboat communities. How many people could maintain their commitment to the hard labor and sparse rewards of a subsistence lifestyle in a period like the Eighties, when energy prices are dropping, supplies seem abundant, and the lessons of the previous energy crisis become at least temporarily irrelevant? If the arrival of significant declines in world petroleum production triggers economic contraction, and thus undercuts the demand for petroleum, another interval like the Eighties is among the most likely outcomes.<br><br>What all this suggests is that the central problem that proposed lifeboat communities must tackle is one of motivation. This same suggestion might have been drawn from the historical parallel that undergirds the entire project. The Christian monasteries that preserved classical culture through the last set of dark ages, after all, were not staffed by people trying to preserve some semblance of a middle-class Roman lifestyle while the world fell apart around them. Quite the opposite—the monks and nuns who copied old texts, taught at abbey schools, and kept the lamps of Western civilization burning when they were at their lowest ebb since Mycenae’s fall voluntarily embraced a lifestyle even more impoverished and restricted than that of the peasants among whom they lived. The same point is equally true of the Buddhist and Taoist monastics who accomplished the same vital task in other places and times. Arguably, it was precisely this willingness to embrace extreme poverty that freed up the time and effort needed for the economically unproductive activities needed to keep the heritage of a civilization alive.<br><br>The motivating factors that guided the followers of Benedict of Nursia, Kobo Daishi, and Chang Daoling, then, may be among the crucial missing pieces in current debates about lifeboat communities, and indeed the entire contemporary crisis of industrial civilization. To explore this possibility, we’re going to have to take a hard look at one of the least understood and, admittedly, most dysfunctional aspects of modern culture, and talk about the place of religion in a response to peak oil.

No one lives on a lifeboat forever. So perhaps a more durable metaphor is in order.<br><br>My small group of friends are trying to find ways to replace the basics, food and clothing, with our own homegrown product or something manufactured locally and sustainably. That's a pretty big challenge. It takes time to work out how to make decent miso, can safely, source local fats and grains, practice effective vermiculture, and so on.<br><br>We're not a lifeboat community because we're not taking off for the countryside, much as we love it. That would contribute to sprawl. We're hoping instead to shift our urban environment back to its preindustrial habits, like composting, orchardry, the use of cisterns, shutters, canopies, lanterns, and so on. We're more about hoisting a main sheet and punching out long covered oarholes in the side of the dear old tub, which was a lively and stylish place to live long before petroleum and industrialization. Not everyone is so lucky in their locale, and I can appreciate the urge to move. But in the end, I suspect sanctuary is something you build, not something you find.<br><br><a href=#c988365239748452602 title="comment permalink">4/18/07, 3:13 PM</a><br><br>

In the wake of Ruby Ridge, Waco, Montana and a pile of Hollowwood movies, I imagine that some folks either don't want to be tarred with that brush, or fear actually encountering them if they *do* try to start a community.<br><br>On the other end of your post, I am struggling with an Earth Day sermon for my UU church this weekend about precisely that subject - the spiritual motivation for environmental action.,. it's a tough subject, and doesn't yield easily to being compressed into 15 minutes!<br><br><a href=#c6907702800170924517 title="comment permalink">4/18/07, 3:23 PM</a><br><br>

I think lizm is right about the metaphor being wrong, we don't want lifeboats, which whilst they signify a journey through hardship to a destination, also indicate that you'll be getting out at the end. Rather we should be looking at seeds of new communities, of new ways of life, that will grow in one place and spread from that centre. Seeds don't have to be planted exclusively in the countryside.<br><br>I think your statement that the central problem is motivation is spot on. Part of motivation is always belief in the outcome. A lot of people still cling to the idea that there will be a way out, that salvation will come in some form and we shall be able to continue our affluent progressive lifestyles.<br><br>Perhaps the monks could see around them the dangers, they could see what was being lost, so the need to preserve things was immediate. The lack of concrete certainty in the current situation makes motivation more an article of faith rather than a response to current conditions.<br><br><a href=#c5976858547802016180 title="comment permalink">4/18/07, 4:35 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c1949415357840676078></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/08724938709642010624 rel=nofollow>Loveandlight</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Your point about lifeboat communities is well-taken. Many of the few alternative communities from the 60's that were successful became casualties of the cyclic "upswing" period of the 80's and 90's for various reasons.<br><br>As for primitivism, I don't necessarily expect to survive the population "implosion" that will probably happen at some point. My own evaluation is that your theory on cyclic decline will be true for a while, then it will get to the point where civilization mostly disintegrates (which is not to say that human societies will cease to exist provided we don't go extinct). There are people who are learning primitive skills. Yes, this is a very small number of people, but once civilization with its complexity isn't around to provide a support system, the Earth will likely be supporting a very much smaller human population.<br><br>Why do I say that? Well, in this country alone, a huge percentage of the farmable topsoil is gone, maybe even as much as 80%. And what topsoil remains won't have much nutrients left in it for supporting agriculture once there are no more fossil-fuel derived fertilizers. Yes, there will be people who know how to rebuild soil with permacultural techniques, but what will likely be taking place is horticulture, or intensive gardening that observes certain limits and does not push yields past the point of diminishing returns. That's a different animal than the totalitarian agriculture civilization has used to support itself. A primitive lifestyle partially supported by horticulture can support a culturally rich human society such as that enjoyed by the pre-Columbian Native Americans, but it is a mistake to call such societies "civilization" in the proper sense of the word, because living within certain limits puts a cap on how complex such societies can become. (I am amused by the temper-tantrums that 20-something LiveJournal latte-liberals throw when I try to explain this difference.) Native American societies such as Cahokia that became addicted to ever-increasing complexity collapsed when the demand for perpetual growth that complexity (civilization) demands caused them to run out of their most vital resource (wood, in the case of Cahokia).<br><br>Another reason I don't see agriculture as it has been practiced over the past 10K years continuing is that climate-change will end the calm, gentle, stable climate (relatively speaking) of the Holocene era that made agriculture possible.<br><br>But as I've said before, it's probably not really for me to say how humans will live sustainably on the planet in the future. I just think the primitivist critique of civilization as it has been so far is the one with the most merit. And if you're going to sympathize with that critique, you pretty much have to take it for granted that the vast majority of people will disagree with you (not to mention that you will occasionally encounter the sort of temper-tantrums I mentioned in a previous paragraph).<br><br><a href=#c1949415357840676078 title="comment permalink">4/18/07, 5:46 PM</a><br><br>

This year we want to try a solar oven, which is a method not yet approved by agricultural extensions. Information is sparse, but there is a book by Eleanor Shimeall on the subject. If you want to stay in touch by email, I'll let you know how it goes. Otherwise, the biggest challenge has just been processing enough to get all of us through the winter and spring, with supplemental produce from our local foods stand. You have to be kind of disciplined and set aside several hours in the evening, when it's a bit cooler. We water can tomatoes, fruits, and conserves, and pressure can veggies. We use the Ball Blue Book as a guide. Our pickling and fermentation efforts are still at an early stage. <br><br>There are refrigeration techniques that you might find helpful. I'm planning to construct a root cellar my basement locker, and there is an Egyptian device known as a zeer, or pot-in-pot refrigerator, which you can read a bit about here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pot-in-pot_refrigerator<br><br>Liz<br><br><a href=#c7675213350127777734 title="comment permalink">4/18/07, 5:55 PM</a><br><br>

Well written and insightful. If you are really interested in the back to the land phenomenon and what it was really like this is highly recommended. If you want a light, "and then we all got stoned" sort of retrospective this will be too analytical but still interesting."<br><br>Myself, I found Agnew a little bit shallow and dismissive of the experiment. She published in 2005, but had no mention of climate change-- that ecological impulse she had was just hippy foolishness.

<div class=avtb id=c7756320512114604935></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/00627270393248813976 rel=nofollow>Danby</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Well, John, this is certainly a post to my own heart! <br>Erik, try your local county extension office. Every county has one, and they have lots of free information and low-cost and even free classes on food preservation. The best 2 general books on the subject are <i>Putting Food By</i>, and <i>Stocking Up</i>. The best low-tech handbook, bar none, on food preservation is <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Stillroom-Cookery-Preserving-Naturally-Measures/dp/0914440136 rel=nofollow> Stillroom Cookery </a> by Grace Firth. <br><br>Having moved out into the sticks almost 20 years ago, I can tell you that it has been nothing like what I expected. As John says, the sheer amount of physical labor involved in raising your own food is incredible. The monetary input has been unbelievable as well. About 12 years ago, it became obvious that we weren't going to make it on the farm alone. I've been working full time at an outside job since. Thankfully, about 6 months ago, I was able to make the transition to full-time telecommuting, so I now again have some time to devote to the farm. The greenhouse will be finished tomorrow. I have some hope of raising a large percentage of our food this year, for the first time in those 12 years.<br><br>If you're thinking of going back to the land, I have some suggestions. The first is to understand why you want to. If you're de-urbanizing out of fear, of economic collapse, or crime, or pollution, or whatever else, you'd better just stay home. All the things you're afraid of in town are worse out in the country. I mean it. I have a convicted, level 3 child molester living adjacent to my property. Second, raise a garden, right where you are now. I've had gardens since I was 8, and I knew how much work it was to hoe a row of peas. Third, get and learn how to use a gun. Where I am it would take about 20 minutes for the police to get here, were I to call. That's enough time to get very very dead. You will have to defend yourself. No-one else will defend you. Fourth, get the tools and skills now. Trying to learn when you're dependent on the outcome can be a bad experience.<br><br>Explicitly lifeboat communities are doomed. Even if you can get one formed and working, it will only last one generation. What will last is a community organized around a specific purpose. I don't even think it's particularly important what that purpose is, provided it is meaningful to the members and serves as a means of ordering the life of the community.<br><br>I think the failure of the communes in the 60's has a simple explanation. What is most important about trying to build a community is that any small community must share a common culture. A culture consists mostly in a set of shared understanding of how the world works, and what is appropriate and inappropriate behavior. Most of the 60's communes failed because a bunch of kids smoking dope and sharing a vague admiration for Marxism is not a shared culture. Some would work hard and some would not. Some would be content to live is squalor, others would not. Some would put their Marxism in practice through petty theft. And free love is a disastrous undertaking in any human society. <br><br>It is also true that unrealistic expectations were shattered on the hard rock of reality. They always are. Some rose to the occasion (Terry Pratchett comes to mind). Most did not. Most do not.<br><br>I agree, from hard experience, that subsistence farming is incredibly difficult. Raising grain, as an example is more expensive than buying it. I don't think subsistence farming should be the goal, unless and until you see an actual societal collapse. The goal should be to be <i>ready</i> to raise most/all of your own food. To have the skills, tools, and resources in place to do so. And to have other skills that are of value in a post-petroleum economy, such as brewing, musicianship, spinning, knitting, knifesmithing, woodcarving, or, for you hunter-gatherers out there, flint knapping. Very few people around the world have ever raised all their own food, made all their own tools, did everything on a self-sufficient basis. Trade is a feature of all human society, so it's good to have something to trade.<br><br>Sorry to roam about so much, but there's far more to be said than really would be appropriate in this sort of forum.<br><br><a href=#c7756320512114604935 title="comment permalink">4/18/07, 8:51 PM</a><br><br>

Thinking about clean air, water, food and hope for the grand kids is a much better goal than circling the wagons IMHO.<br> <br>The bigger concern is the climate change consequences of not reigning in our CO2 emissions. <br>I fully agree with Danby that energy should be expended on growing as much of your own food. For knowledge, food quality (nutritional density).

In the past, many or most individuals existed under regimes of hard physical labor and the difficulties of famine and disease, their Dark Ages may seem like a minor adjustment in lifestyle compared to what we may have in store. The religious orders could hide their information and relics and live sparsely. Why attack a religious outpost when you can’t find the treasures and they don’t have much food either? I’m afraid that we are entirely unfit and unprepared for what’s coming, not just the end of oil but the end of natural gas and then the collapse of the electrical grid. If we could all spend a few years in a labor camp and then find ourselves free in an energy restricted environment we might feel much better about the whole thing but we are spoiled by our energy slaves. I’m afraid we are being led right to the edge of a cliff while our corporate and government leaders hurriedly loot our treasury. Those on the edge of the cliff will pushed over by the incessant pressure from behind. Some will fight and throw others into the abyss. Some will close their eyes and freefall into their dreamy netherworld. Maybe they’ll decide to throw all the old useless people over first. “Everyone over 65, to the front.” Faster than the doomed can fall the word will work its way back through the throngs of condemned and anarchy will ensue. Maybe this is why the mass media has failed to mention our predicament. They want our procession over the cliff to be peaceful and organized and if our behavior becomes too unruly the Blackwater mercenaries will show us no mercy. So go out to BestBuy and purchase that home entertainment system and continue watching the fools on T.V., you know the ones, the chuckleheads whose job it is to convince all the zombies that everything is all right. That’s what you want to hear isn’t it – everything is going to be all right.<br><br><a href=#c4580249529828308280 title="comment permalink">4/19/07, 5:56 AM</a><br><br>

Lizm, I agree wholeheartedly about the problems with the "lifeboat" metaphor. One of its many downsides is that it misses the existence of a world of options between full immersion in modern industrial life and an isolated cabin in the woods. It's in that middle ground, it seems to me, that successful responses to the crisis of industrial society are to be found. <br><br>This was among the reasons why my spouse and I moved from Seattle a few years back to a small town in southern Oregon. We grow some of our own food and support local organic growers who produce most of the rest, and have been phasing in other appropriate-tech lifestyle changes as time and funds permit. That's the sanctuary we're building, but it's not a panacea -- there are urban areas well suited to long term sustainability, too, and kudos to you for pursuing that path. <br><br>Erik, good point. As for canning, talk to your county extension agent, or the local Grange!<br><br>Bunnygirl, getting out of debt and providing one's own health care are real challenges, but for most of us they're not insuperable. I think it's the fear of them, rather than the reality, that keeps most people chained. <br><br>Geoff, my take is that the monks had other reasons for doing what they did -- they weren't responding to their society at all, but rather to the teachings of their faith. Much more on this next week. <br><br>Loveandlight, the one thing I'd point out in response to the whole neoprimitivist theory is that there's a spectrum of human social complexity. Of course societies of the deindustrial age will be less complex than today's urban-industrial system -- sheer energy limits will see to that -- but more modest urban centers have thrived for thousands of years in suitable environments. <br><br>I expect that to continue far into the future, in those bioregions suited to agriculture -- which admittedly are only a small fraction of the earth's surface. As for the impact of climate change, there's a post in the works on this; it's not often recognized that agriculture took over from mixed economies during a time of extreme climate change at the end of the last ice age, precisely because small-scale grain farming is more resilient than most of the alternatives. More on this later.<br><br>By The Creek, many thanks -- I'll check it out. <br><br>Dan, excellent advice! If you ever decide to do a second blog on such themes, let me know and I'll put out the word in the peak oil community -- it'll be something a lot of people should read. <br><br>Eboy, all good points. Yes, I expect rationing and some steep declines in civil liberties in the decades to come. <br><br>Kjmclark, one of the things that makes the "lifeboat community" concept, as usually conceived, so problematic is that it doesn't have a destination. It's as though people are thinking in Hollywood terms -- lots of drama, then you get to the end of the movie and nothing comes next. My interest is in the long term, and that requires not a lifeboat, if you will, but an island -- or a continent. <br><br>Dopamine, notice how the only alternatives you're considering are at the far ends of the spectrum. Step outside either/or thinking and you'll find many more possibilities opening up. <br><br>Steve, many thanks! This is a crucial point -- local community networks, not the fantasy of total self-sufficiency, are the basis for human survival in nonindustrial societies. Mind you, it's a mistake to idealize local community networks -- they have their problems also -- but they're viable in a deindustrial environment, and the alternatives aren't. <br><br>Michael, yes, that's the challenge. The motivation needed to tackle it -- now that's the question. <br><br>By the Creek, remember that China has a few thousand years more experience with boom and bust than America does. My guess is that when the dust settles, something called China will still be around; I have extreme doubts that anything like America will be intact even a century from now. But we'll see.<br><br><a href=#c5740333331629428397 title="comment permalink">4/19/07, 9:33 AM</a><br><br>

The idea of living in a no-petroleum world is not a new one. Mankind did it for several thousand years before oil was found in Pennsylvania in the 19th century. Cheap energy has changed so much of how people live that perhaps it's not obvious how a society without petroleum is structured.<br><br>Look the world over and you will see that human society, once out of the hunter-gatherer stage, can be divided into 3 levels; village, town and city. <br><br>A village is a small group of homes, often farmsteads, clustered amidst the fields and forests. It draws it's resources directly from the land around it. The residents are mostly involved directly in the production of local goods, whether farm produce, fish, wood, salt, or whatever else.<br><br>A town is a larger collection of homes and some businesses. Historically, it would provide services and trade to residents of the outlying villages. A typical town would include a church (in Asia a temple), a smithy, a mill, perhaps a baker, usually some sort of governmental authority (hall of the local noble, court or police), and various craftsmen and vendors. (say fish, or manufactured goods). A town is be the location of the market, at which the residents of the outlying villages bring their produce (food and craftswork) for sale to other locals as well as merchants, who will resell the goods elsewhere.<br><br>A city, functionally is to the towns what the town is to the villages. It is a seat of local, regional or national government, it houses the cathedral, it's markets feature a great variety of goods from the outlying districts as well as from other regions or countries.<br><br>Cities, towns and villages have been the structure of human habitation since before the development of writing. It is only in the last 150 years or so, since the development of the train, that that structure has been altered.<br><br>Of course you can live in town and maintain a farm in the country. Before the introduction of the automobile, it was the standard practice in the midwest US for farmers to maintain a separate home in town for residence in the winter.

A lot of comments already - the number seems to be increasing exponentially as time goes by. I now find myself checking your site a couple of times a day to see if the latest installment has been posted! <br><br>I noted your comment "It's in that middle ground, it seems to me, that successful responses to the crisis of industrial society are to be found." In the UK, a lot of people are carefully watching the Transition Towns initiative which now encompasses about 10 towns, small regions and cities. Would you classify this as a "lifeboat" of the sort that has no chance of staying afloat, or as a "middle-ground" movement that can adapt and survive if the cyclical decline you predict comes about?<br><br>One good thing about this movement, especially in the "lead" town of Totnes is the way in which it integrates itself with current society and commerce in the town, rather than trying to become isolationist. Admittedly, the town itself is an unusual one where shopping malls and chain stores have not destroyed local communities and businesses. The founder of this movement Rob Hopkins, told me that when he moved to UK from Ireland he selected Totnes as a place to live as it was the most peak oil proof place he could find. Even so, I think this is the most promising initiative I've seen in anything related to peak oil. <br><br>I await with interest the next post on the role of religion. I must admit I await it also with a small amount of trepidation as UK is a very secular country and any religion which involves behavior different from the norm is readily labeled as a cult whereby the opinions of its followers can be discounted.

As you suggest, most of us already live in communities -- we don't need to create new ones, but rather need to reinhabit the ones right around us.

More on this later. <br><br>Loveandlight, many thanks for the tips. <br><br>Jason, I didn't particularly have you in mind when I grumbled about neoprimitive cougar bait. It's been my experience, though, that the vast majority of people who espouse the neoprimitive ideology have done exactly nothing to prepare for the extraordinarily difficult challenge of hunter-gatherer living. If your experience has been different, I'm glad to hear it. As for the topsoil issue, expect a discussion of that in a later post. <br><br>Dan, this is a good typology. I'm guessing that something close to the preindustrial version of this will also be the postindustrial one. <br><br>Maura, the jury's still out on the Transition Town movement, though I have hopes. If they can maintain momentum when the price of oil drops again, they'll be good for the long term. I certainly hope they manage it.

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c6824686132358543201></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/04205235466179190199 rel=nofollow>Matt</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>The pot-in-pot idea is an amazing one, and the wikipedia entry on it is certainly educational. This, I think, is a fine example of an appropriate technology that will be very useful in a time of less energy. While many put its origins from the African continent, it seems much more likely to me that it's just one of those good ideas that a lot of people came up with at the same time. Here, for instance, is an appearance in a book of <a href=http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/devicesToC.html rel=nofollow>Handy Farm Devices</a>, from 1910, of a very similar device:<br><br><a href=http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/devices3b.html rel=nofollow>Homemade Water Cooler</a><br><br>Really what that is, the book I mean, is a collection of devices that were probably very common before oil showed up on the scene. I think you could compare it to the general knowledge of the seasons and planting schedules and signs of weather that were, at one time, common cultural knowledge but are now as mysterious as a shaman's chants. <br><br>Now, I'm sure I don't have a true comprehension of the difficulty in growing enough food to support you and yours, but I do have some comments on that issue, what JMG dismissed as "a little pottering around in garden beds with a copy of a half-read book in one hand" by people like my parents, who were definitely in the whole back to the Earth movement, and have the bookshelf to prove it. <br><br>First, please know I am as wary as anyone in these discussions of discussing any prediction on the future as if it were a certainty. I try to keep the possibility (Hope?) in the back of my mind that maybe this whole peak oil, collapse of industrial civiliazation thing will, you know, blow over. Still, I've made my decisions, as the Appropriate Tech grad school acceptance I received now two hours ago attests to. Anyway!<br><br>Second, I'd like to point out that if the people who have half-read those books and pottered about were actually facing rising food prices and a hungry stomach, I'm pretty sure they would read the book all the way through, and get up a little earlier in the morning to potter a little harder. Hunger is the great motivator, right? Yes, I know that we're talking about a whole lot of people who need a whole lot of food, but I also know that we here in the United States are blessed with a whole lot of space. When (If, right?) the fan starts getting gummed up with you know what, and your first reaction is to go full throttle with your backyard organic garden and canning operation, it seems to me that the only reasonable, intelligent and humanitarian second reaction is to bring your neighbor over to show him how to do what you're doing. <br><br>(That is, of course, for people living in areas where there is some green space, but urban gardening is certainly a possibility -- there are books on it!)<br><br>(And an old proverb or something to make the point: The best place to keep excess food is in your neighbor's stomach.)<br><br>This, also, is a very suitable reaction to the slow shuffle down the slope of peak oil that many before have spoken about. This is an incremental adjustment where small portions of the local population pick up the slack on food production, and when more people need to join in, there will already be a community support network of knowledge. <br><br>Which brings me back to the Handy Farm Devices I mentioned earlier. The entire book is online, by the way, though the construction is detailed less than the principle. James Howard Kunstler, most notably I think, rants against the thinking that some magical technology will come along and save us and our SUVs, and I certainly agree with him to a fault. I do think that technologies, both new and old-but-new-to-most, will come into our lives. There are a lot of well-educated computer scientists and automotive engineers and landscape architechts and all sorts of educated professions that will be out of work, and these are exactly the sorts of people who will be using their evenings under an LED lightbulb in their house figuring out the next step in technological advancement using old car parts and levels of energy efficiency unheard of today. <br><br>Last, reading JMG's posts makes me nervous about commenting because my thoughts are automatically less organized and thought out than his. I am in awe over his competence in discussing the physical, cultural, and philosophical sides to these issues. So, please excuse me if I seem less than fluent.<br><br><a href=#c6824686132358543201 title="comment permalink">4/19/07, 5:57 PM</a><br><br>

I can't imagine how hard it would be to get that tree cleared away (and cut up for firewood) without chainsaws — and we'll all be pretty stiff from cutting &amp; lifting as it is. BTW, there are likely lifeboat communities out there, but they're likely the survivalist-wacko type &amp; they have no problem with using (or storing large amounts of) fossil fuels.<br><br>Erik: look into dehydrating food as well as canning. Tomatoes, peppers, mushrooms, and larger fruits (haven't tried berries or grapes) are well-suited for dehydrating — drop a silica gel packet in a jar to absorb any stray moisture, fill it with your dried food, and cap it tightly.

We didn't have supermarkets and almost everything we ate was produced within fifty miles and came in by train. The old infrastructure still works.

Not sure if this will be of interest, but the Druid organization I head has launched a forum for sharing ideas and experiences with sustainable living -- you can find it at <a href=http://forum.cyberdragons.org/aoda/index.php rel=nofollow>The Druid Sustainability Forum</a>. No, you don't have to be into Druidry to participate. <br><br>Matt, I don't at all mean to put down pottering in the garden -- far from it; if people are going to learn how to feed themselves, that's usually the most viable way to start. My point was simply that you can't make an overnight transition to complete self-sufficiency that way, and the failure to grasp this was one of the things that made most of the communes of the Sixties go under. Many congrats, BTW, on your acceptance to the AT program!<br><br>Loveandlight, I have some fairly sharp disagreements with Jason's "Thirty Theses" -- to my mind they're rife with exactly the sort of immanentizing of myth I've spent so many screens critiquing on this blog. But that's a topic for a post all by itself. <br><br>Joel, I have to admit that the possibility of a punk monasticism had never occurred to me! It's not impossible; it's precisely on the cultural fringes that the future takes shape. Much more on this in the weeks to come. <br><br>Bryant, there are a number of the old communes that made it. Might be worth seeing if they had anything in common, and using that as a guide to future projects. <br><br>Phaidraigin, it's exactly the sort of changes you're making in your own life, as I see it, that hold the most hope for bringing something positive out of this mess. Kudos to you!<br><br>Lususnaturae, if that's the path that calls you, go for it. Time's short, there's a lot of work to do, and I don't know of anyone who's focusing on the preservation of knowledge yet. A network or informal organization for the purpose might be worth considering. <br><br>Farfetched and Lizm, you (and Matt) are onto the most important advantage we've got in the present predicament: the world approaching us is not that different from the world our grandparents grew up in, and a lot of the old, clever, sustainable technologies of the past are among our best options for the future.

Nothing asked in return. 3 years ago, the dairy needed a place to get rid of some 20 acre-feet (860,0000 cubic feet) of liquid manure in a hurry, guess who they call. To the dairy, it's a problem, to my friend,it's fertilizer. And he sent 3 tanker truckloads my way. No return asked, it's just how things work. <br><br>All the neighbors know that I'll take any spoiled hay they have left at the beginning of summer. To them it's worthless, you can't feed it to anything. To me it's a slow fertilizer. I lay them out side-by side to completely cover a garden bed, cut the strings, and till it in in the spring. It can sure build up organic matter in a hurry.<br><br>One of the most important things you have to learn to do is to buy from our neighbors. These are the people you will depend on if things go to hell. Safeway, Walmart, Home Depot, they don't care. They can't care. If you're a regular customer at the local hardware store, or farmer's market, people get to know you They'll do business with you too. And they'll care.<br><br>Gotta go. It's april, too much to do. Soon, if you're lucky, I tell how to make a motor-operated fool flail.<br><br><a href=#c7748554004479015158 title="comment permalink">4/20/07, 9:17 PM</a><br><br>

This has been my experience also -- the communities we live in are the communities we need, and the ones we need to help build. <br><br>Loveandlight, the interesting thing about the three theses you've mentioned is that if the word "civilization" in them means modern industrial civilization, I agree with them wholeheartedly. The myth of progress mandates exactly the sort of self-defeating pursuit of growth and complexity Jason describes, and of course Tainter's logic about the diminishing returns of increasing complexity is faultless. <br><br>The weakness in the argument is the claim that the growth-at-all-costs attitude is inherent in civilization as a whole, and historically speaking, this simply isn't true. Just for starters, take a look at imperial China -- the longest continuously functioning civilization in recorded history -- which did it by self-consciously pursuing stability and stasis, not growth.

Where are the lifeboat communities? We are all around you.<br><br>The reason you don't see us is that you expect a lifeboat community to look like something else. Most of us don't think of ourselves as lifeboats. That's not why we do what we do. Yet, we will be the ones to take up the slack when the society and the economy collapse.<br>Here are a few examples:<br><br>The Amish in the US number about 150,000. They maintain a tradition f going without most modern technology, most especially motor vehicles. Their reason for doing so is twofold, to maintain a separation from the world, and to encourage a tight-knit community. If your asked an old-order Amishman about is community being a lifeboat for western civilization, he would reject the concept outright he would explain to you about obedience and communitarian living. And still, when the oil goes away, the Amish will be uniquely situated to serve as a lifeboat. other religious traditions that can fall into the same category are the Mennonites, the Hutterites, and the Brethren. All told, that could total out at a couple of million worldwide, some significant portion of which <i>already</i> live a fairly petroleum-free life.<br><br>Ecologically-minded people have been finding ways to tread lightly for thirty or more years. There are lots of them about, doing what they consider the right thing. Locally we have an outfit that logs with horses. No big operation, no community worthy of the word. Just a couple of blue-collar guys that gave up their commercial logging jobs years ago, and send time in the woods, working with their draft horses. They sell low-impact environmentally friendly thinning and tree management services. <br><br>This weekend was the 29th <a href=smallfarmersjournal.com rel=nofollow>Small Farmer's Journal </a>Draft Horse and Horsedrawn Equipment <br>auction in Sisters Oregon. I had planned on attending, but sent Saturday retrieving my daughter's broke-down car instead. I'm not sure about this year, but last year over 20,000 attended. These are people directly involved in or interested in horse-powered farming. Small Farmer's Journal has been actively serving the horse-powered farmer for over 30 years. The reasons people want to farm this way are endlessly varied, but some common themes emerge. All love horses. Many are retired or converted conventional farmers who want to farm, rather than drive a tractor for a living. Religious or semi-religious factors are common. <br><br>Are SFJ readers a community? In a distributed and loose-knit way, yes. Are they a lifeboat community? In some cases, yes, explicitly. For some, yes, in an indirect and secondary way. For many, the question wouldn't even make sense. Would you even notice this community unless you were specifically plugged into it? Not likely.<br><br>Then there are people like me and my family. We moved out into the country almost 20 years ago. The goal was a decent place to raise the kids. The idea of a lifeboat was always there. Not for society, but for my family. I never gave much concern for our society. I think it is broken beyond mending, and will require extensive surgery, without anaesthetic, to fix it. Would you notice us, in your search for lifeboat communities? No. We keep a low profile, intentionally. The modern world doesn't like people who reject it's premises, and tends to interfere with their lives. <br><br>And finally, you. You may already be part of the lifeboat you are looking for. A lifeboat doesn't have to look like a commune or an intentional community to do the job, or an essential part of it. As I said in a previous post, the important thing is to be <i>ready</i>. You need to have the knowledge and tools in place to just pick up the pieces if it falls apart.<br><br><a href=#c8768851157026944904 title="comment permalink">4/22/07, 11:36 PM</a><br><br>

I have run into the notion a lot that "lifeboat community" = eco-commune. Assuming one even has the money to put together such a thing, communal living is a seriously unattractive option for many (possibly most) people, including me.<br><br>I would much rather be an autonomous node in a network than "Seven of Nine." Networks are far more resilient than centrally-commanded systems anyway, for a huge variety of reasons. I think any place that has arable soil, clean water, and social capital (or the capacity to uncover it) has a pretty good chance of developing resilient networks as things deteriorate.<br><br>I am also inclined to think that farmers markets are the early stages of these resilient networks wherever they thrive. At many farmers markets (at least the ones around here) you can find not just vegetables and fruits, but animal products like meat, milk, and eggs; all kinds of breads; health-care services like massage or reiki; hand-made clothing; and other necessities of life made or grown by local people (as well as non-necessities like arts, crafts, etc., that make life more fun and might be said to contain "cultural knowledge"). <br><br>A thriving farmers market might just <i>be</i> a lifeboat community for those involved in it. Likewise, the networks that grow up around CSAs might be lifeboat communities as well; local sewing clubs, woodworking clubs, and the like may end up being nodes in the network; on and on.<br><br>Anyway, I guess my point is simply to agree with danby -- lifeboat communities don't have to be eco-communes, and it could well be that we don't even recognize them around us because we don't appreciate their post-petroleum survival value. I don't think eco-communes are going to survive, personally -- to me they just look like smaller versions of what's collapsing already.<br><br><a href=#c5643804962155705548 title="comment permalink">4/23/07, 7:59 AM</a><br><br>

My work and study in Ecology and Permaculture backs this up.<br><br>The most complex biomes are those with the most available energy, like tropical rain forests, whereas the simplest biomes are those with the least energy available, such as arctic or alpine tundra.<br><br>I think that by focusing on examples like huge monoculture farms and the domination of English, you are looking at mere artifacts of having greater complexity at higher levels.<br><br>The 320-acre wheat farm would not be possible without the higher-level complexity of industrial manufacturing, commodities markets, the financial "industry," land use regulations, taxes, and government.<br><br>In fact, this is a perfect example of local complexity versus global entropy: the piles of complexity with which civilization burdens agriculture necessarily requires agriculture to simplify, in order that the overall entropy is preserved.<br><br><b>Restoring appropriate complexity</b><br><br>Another way of looking at it is that either the rapid collapse or slow dismemberment of western civilization as we know it may actually <i>enable</i> restoring biological complexity.<br><br>When cross-continental shipping becomes prohibitively expensive, who will have 320 acre monocultures?

Simply this: the coming petrocollapse is our friend, not our enemy. A reduction in overall energy necessitates a reduction in overall complexity, which just may mean an <i>appropriate</i> level of complexity can return to small biomes, local communities, even regional dialects becoming new languages.<br><br>It's not that I'm some sort of doom-seeker -- I dread the thought of all the living things that are going to be in a real hurt before this all settles out, many generations from now.

Or are there fewer types of entities, each one demonstrating fewer behaviors, and showing less adaptability than would otherwise be the case?<br><br>I see animals replaced with dumb, nonresponsive, and low-entropy machines.

It might seem trivial, but the word "complex" has a whole host of other connotations associated with it from non-linear dynamics and systems theory. <br><br>Consider your typical suburban lawn, or farm monoculture; in and of itself not very complex. However, two points. Firstly, the complexity required to support it is enormous: nothing less than the entire petroleum infrastructure for fertilizers, tractors for tilling, trucks for shipping, etc. Whole hierarchies of organization and systems of production that criss-cross the globe and generate massive amounts of entropy enable its existence. Which brings me to the second point: the lawn or monoculture is a system in disequilibrium with its environment, and as such, requires continuous effort (i.e. energy, thus generating more entropy outiside itself) to be maintained as it is. I should note that not all monocultures need the oil-civilization to exist, but the benefits in such situations often aren't enough to justify the effort and the risks can be enormous (e.g. potato famine).<br><br>As for cities... To quote Richard Register on p. 47-48 of "Ecocities":<br><br><i>Appreciation for nature takes many forms among city folk. The average city is a complex botanical garden of trees, bushes, and flowers from all over the world: on streets, in parks and yards, in containers on porches, in lobbies and living rooms, hanging from macrame, attached to chunks of dried peat moss - from tiny lobelia and Johnny-jump-ups to giant sunflowers and towering redwoods, from showy palm trees to bushy ferns loved passionately by their owners. Aquariums, terrariums, and birdcages are perennially popular. <br><br>Biodiversity in cities, despite the acreage given over to buildings, barren rooftops, and asphalt streets and parking lots, is very high, surpassing that of many environments where few or no people live. Dogs, cats, guinea pigs, hamsters, snakes, geckos, chmeleons, tarantulas, ants, and worms are all living in our homes and schools.</i><br><br><a href=#c8190779828625060215 title="comment permalink">4/25/07, 1:32 PM</a><br><br>

However, you possibly overrate the role of Christian monasteries as "lifeboat communities" for the preserval of ancient knowledge. The early monks only kept some of the pagan philosophical works (usually Neoplatonic) as supplementary tools for their interpretation of the Scriptures, not because they saw ancient and valuable knowledge in danger of being lost. On other occasions, they gladly burned down pagan temples and libraries, destroying many pages and many lives (check out the fate of Hypatia). Aristotle, for example, only became fashionable in Europe in the 12th century. If it hadn't been for the preservation efforts of the Arabs, he would be largely unknown today. The problem of the post-industrial world is rather that there won't be any modern-day equivalent of this thriving parallel culture. We shouldn't fool ourselves in thinking that the urge to preserve knowledge is powerful enough to create a new monastic movement. Higher motivations are called for...<br><br><a href=#c2546717396367485882 title="comment permalink">4/26/07, 5:58 AM</a><br><br>

These technologies would include public works, architecture, manufacturing capabilities, and modes of transportation. Then there's the business of having a strong military to defend the wealth and the trade routes, to acquire the raw materials for manufacture, and to secure the labor force for building and public works projects--usually slave labor, though sometimes the labor of a permanent underclass. <br><br>What we've been taught to define as "civilization" is a rigidly stratified class society that usually includes slavery as one of its features, and usually is, or becomes, imperialistic. The wealth and technological marvels of such societies, historically, seem to be dependent on empire, slave labor, and class stratification. <br><br>Hence, obviously, the wealth of such societies was never characterized by an improved standard of living for everyone, but by an affluent standard of living for a few, at the expense of a much lower standard of living for the majority of the people within the orbit of the "civilization" and its empire.<br><br>We've also been taught to regard any social organization that doesn't follow this model as "barbaric" or "uncivilized." <br><br>Since it seems self-evident (to me) that what we've been taught to define as "civilization" is, in reality, probably the most barbaric of all possible social organizations--being simply an organization for the systematic exploitation natural resources and the labor of others--maybe we need a different definition of "civilization."<br><br>Perhaps we should define "civilization" as a social organization characterized by civility--one that secures the maximum of personal freedom and security for all its members. Civility implies things like honesty, justice, and generosity in dealings with others, and respect for the individual and individual creativity. <br><br>It seems to me that civilizations made up of large urban centers with their monumental architecture and vast public works mostly evolved as the carapace needed to encase what were essentially imperialistic class/slave societies. We've been taught that this is what civilization is, and to reverence the architecture and public works as technological marvels, when they were, in essence, technologies that were developed mainly for the purpose of making imperialistic slave/class societies workable. <br><br>Historically, the main focus of technological advance seems to have been to develop the technologies that were most useful from the standpoint of empire-building and and the utilization of mass forced labor. <br><br>It hardly seems necessary or inevitable that technologies have to evolve in conformity with this model of "civilization."<br><br>If we focused on technologies that made people independent, instead of dependent, it seems probable to me that we could have a relatively high standard of living for all--and a society that is truly "civilized."<br><br><a href=#c2345924377575438219 title="comment permalink">6/19/07, 12:50 AM</a><br><br>

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c4245457512429322182></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/09151626560030214444 rel=nofollow>Brother Tom</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>I've had a strong urge to respond to your "Lifeboat Communities" post ever since it appeared in April, but I'm an old man, and have trouble focussing my thoughts and expressing them in an orderly way.<br><br>There is a wide-spread hunger for a more communal life style; there was a book going around a few decades ago entitled "Living Together in a World Falling Apart." Those of us who are most aware of the falling-apart are perhaps the ones most interested, whether we are Bunyan's "Pilgrim", or part of the environmental movement. The ideal, of course, is that the life-boat is big enough to hold us all. and that the life which is preserved is not only physical survival, but is a life worth living; hopefully more so than most of us experience in the world at present.<br><br>I've been a member of a religious communal movement for over 50 years. The movement began in Germany after WWI in great poverty, was forced by the rise of Hitler to relocate first to England, and in 1941 to back-woods Paraguay. No other country would take in a group of mixed nationalities like ours and grant them exemption from military service. In this primitive setting, we had full opportunity of experiencing what a life-boat community is like. Young men used to being clerks and scholars were obliged to learn farming, gardening, and building at a very basic level, with practically no tools or materials beyond what the land provided. The few trained doctors among our members did their best without most of the medicines or equipment they had learned to rely on in Europe.<br><br>Not everyone made it: Especially hard was the death of many small children in the first years, due to diseases, poor nutrition, and oppressive climate. But after 15 years of hard effort, when I finally saw their community, they had definitely carved out a viable way of life. Solutions had been found to all the basic problems of food, shelter, transportation, education, and other necessities. Children and elderly were well cared for. Needs were met to the best of our ability. There were outlets for music, art, and recreation on a modest scale. <br><br>You are right to raise the issue of religion in this connection. "Intentional communities" have been tried again and again, for idealistic reasons of all flavors, and by very sincere people; but by and large, only the religiously-based ones last. In our experience, the success of such ventures depends much more on the faith and committment of members than upon skills or knowledge. The latter can always be acquired as needed. But lack of unity in the former can be disasterous.<br><br>"Religion" can bring up the picture of endless arguments about details of beliefs and forms of worship, but I'm referring to something that can provide a uniting center for people with different backgrounds and opinions. For communal life to flourish, the participants must be united in their convictions about what is important: <br><br>What gives life meaning? What makes life worth living? <br>When push comes to shove, what values will be held onto; <br> the common good, or short-term individual advantage? <br>Is there a basis for the humility to listen to one another? <br> To be willing to be corrected without touchiness? <br> To apologize when it is fitting?<br>Where will we look for hope, when everything seems to be falling apart? <br>What will give us courage to hold on through the very difficult times?<br><br>The irony is that already now we need each other, we depend on each other, but we act as if that is not so. We wait for the next disaster to drive us together, but if we can't live well now, work together in mutual support, bear one another's weaknesses, in the present world with all its material advantages, how are we going to become ready after the difficulties of life get still worse? <br><br>There is a desperate need for leadership and example here; who is going to provide it?<br><br>Once a basis of faith and committment is established, of course, it is easier to pursue alternative energy projects, local food-raising, organic gardening, home-schooling, and all the other desireable projects in a communal setting than it is in an isolated family.<br><br><a href=#c4245457512429322182 title="comment permalink">8/20/07, 4:34 AM</a><br><br>

I however think that slowly more and more people will transit toward this non-industrial life style when time will be more and more propice. Will it be in time? Probably not, but I suspect a change that will take place certainly and probably faster than what we anticipate.<br><br>Even globally we can see some of those trends that are changing relatively fast: in the mid1990 up to 2005 (ok very roughly) it was trendy to go shopping outside the city to those huge mall, I think it definitely killed any decent small shop down town and worse it simply killed a lots of downtown activities. But since, we can see more and more activities toward a lots of those downtown cities. Those activities are still mostly toward luxurious product (zillion of shoes and cloth store) but there is more and more those odd and not part of huge Corp store or restaurant. <br><br>The organic grown effort: I think in the mid 1990 it was mostly accessible to midclass posh people but now we can see more and more people buying organic food: I am living in Scotland and at the local food store almost 20-30% of all food is organically grown.<br><br>Another thing also I observed: there is more and more people interested into old traditional job. Blacksmith is a good example, although I consider it more like an hobbit than a real job for a lots of people, it is a trend now that can have an impact within few years as it is a sort of knowledge acquisition that is shared by more people.<br><br>I don’t think that the technology will definitely save us with free energy motor, or electric or hydrogen complicated technology but there is around very simple technology that are not fully used (due probably to the fact that oil is still cheap) like the Stirling motor (external combustion motor), there will be probably more and more valorization of those type of technology developed very long time ago, better steam engine and the zeppelin return just to name fews. <br><br>About a potential global future lifestyle, I remember reading in the New Scientist few months ago (between Oct –Dec 2007) where they compared “quality of life” (define in term of education, health system and other basic indicator) in different country versus how many planet will be needed to sustain those people if everybody on earth was acting like this specific country. Ok it is probably not clear let say if all people living on Planet earth was having an American lifestyle, we will need 5-8 planets let say. On the other hand if everybody is having a lifestyle form a country like Sierra Leone or Gambia we will probably need less than 25% of earth ressource but we can suspect a life quality that is not sustainable in term of global development. The only country that has a “decent quality of life” without taking too much a toll on earth was Cuba! <br><br> I can imagine that globally we will reach that level of different development. I think it will be a shock for very industrialized country but maybe less for those countries not part of the G7. Maybe we have to rethink the concept of lifeboat as not small enclave within the industrial world but as full country like Cuba.<br><br><a href=#c4624388933261990412 title="comment permalink">10/25/08, 8:35 AM</a><br><br>
