There have been many times, during the two and a half years I’ve been writing posts for <span style="font-style: italic">The Archdruid Report</span>, when I’ve found myself staring at a blank computer screen of a Wednesday morning, wondering what on Earth I can say that my readers might find even remotely interesting. Happily, such times have been scarce this November. A passing reference, in my post two weeks ago, to my dissatisfaction with a presentation on the Transition Town movement brought a flurry of comments asking me to say more about that; I did so last week, and fielded another flurry of comments as well as some lively critiques on other blogs.<br><br>The core argument of last week’s post centered on the possibility of building a better future by deliberate planning, and many of the comments and critiques took issue with my suggestion that this is not only impossible but counterproductive. While most of these latter noted that they were participants in the Transition Town movement, the ideas they expressed in that context are anything but unique to that movement; rather, it expresses a consensus that extends through most of the peak oil scene, and indeed, most of contemporary society. Despite its popularity, though, this confidence in our ability to plan the future seems woefully misplaced to me, and the reasons that have forced me to dissent from the consensus may be worth discussing here.<br><br>Trying to plan a way out of the crisis of industrial society is an old habit. Back in the 1970s, when the challenge posed by the limits to growth was first showing up on the radar screens of our collective discourse, a great deal of discussion centered on how global planning could back humanity away from the brink; since then, similar plans on various scales – local, regional, national, global – have appeared at regular intervals. The durable Lester Brown, to name only one of these would-be planners, released the original version of his <span style="font-style: italic">Plan B</span> in 2003; he’s now on version 3.0, and further versions will no doubt be forthcoming in due time.<br><br>A double helping of irony surrounds all this flurry of planning. If the crisis we face could be met by making plans, we’d have little to worry about; the difficulty is that making plans is the easy part. Go digging in the archives of most American municipalities and you’ll find an energy plan drafted and adopted, after extensive citizen input, in the 1970s, calling for exactly the changes that would have made matters today much less dire: conservation standards, public transit projects, zoning changes to reduce the need for cars, and so on. You’ll have to brush a quarter inch of dust off the plan to read it, though, since nobody has looked at it since the Reagan years, and not one of its recommendations was still functioning when the housing boom began in the early 1990s. A certain skepticism toward another round of plans may thus be in order.<br><br>Yet there’s a second dimension to the irony, because the recurrent gap between plan and implementation is not the only difficulty that has to be faced. The assumption common to all these plans is that it’s possible to anticipate the process of transition to a deindustrial society in enough detail to make planning meaningful. I suggest that this assumption is badly in need of a hard second look.<br><br>There are two widely held beliefs these days about how we can deal with the end of the age of petroleum. The first claims that we simply need to find another energy source as cheap, abundant, and concentrated as petroleum, and run our society on that instead. The second claims that we simply need to replace those parts of our society that depend on cheap, abundant, concentrated energy with others that lack that dependence, and run our society with them instead. Most people in the peak oil scene, I think, have caught onto the problem with the first belief: there is no other energy source available to us that is as cheap, abundant, and concentrated as petroleum; the fact that we want one does not oblige the universe to provide us with one, and so we might as well plan to power our society by harnessing unicorns to treadmills.<br><br>The problem with the second belief is of the same order, but it’s much less widely recognized. Toss aside the parts of our society that depend on cheap, abundant, concentrated energy, and there’s nothing left. Nor are the components needed for a new low-energy society sitting on a shelf somewhere, waiting to be used; we’ve got some things that worked tolerably well in simpler agrarian societies, and some promising new developments that have been tested on a very small scale and seem to work so far, but we have nothing like a complete kit. Thus we can’t simply swap out a few parts and keep going; everything has to change, and we have no way of knowing in advance what changes will be required.<br><br>This last point is often missed. One of the people who commented on last week’s post, a software designer by trade, pointed out that he starts work on a project by envisioning what the new software is going to do, and then figures out a way to do it; he argued that it makes just as much sense to do the same thing with human society. A software designer, though, knows the capabilities of the computers, operating systems, and computer languages his programs will use; he also knows how similar tasks have been done by other designers in the past. We don’t have any of those advantages in trying to envision a sustainable future society.<br><br>Rather, we’re in the position of a hapless engineer tasked in 1947 with drafting a plan to develop word processing software. At that time, nobody knew whether digital or analog computers were the wave of the future; the handful of experimental computer prototypes that existed then used relays, mechanical linkages, vacuum tubes, and other soon-to-be-outmoded technologies, while the devices that would actually make it possible to build computers that could handle word processing had not yet been invented, or even imagined. Under those conditions, the only plan that would have yielded any results would consist of a single sentence: “Invest heavily in basic research, and see what you can do with the results.” Any other plan would have been wasted breath, and the more detailed the plan, the more useless it would have been.<br><br>The difficulty faced by our imaginary engineer is that meaningful planning can only take place when the basic outlines of the solution are already known. A different metaphor may help clarify how this works. Imagine that you suddenly wake up in a hotel room in Edinburgh. A mysterious woman tells you that you have been drugged and brought there secretly, it’s now December 30, and you have to get a message to someone you will meet beneath the statue of Nelson in Trafalgar Square in London at midnight on New Year’s Eve. If you succeed, Earth will be saved and you will get 100 million Euros. Since you know where you are, where you have to be, and how much time you have – the clock by the bed says 10 am – you can easily make plans and carry them out.<br><br>Now imagine the same scenario, except that the hotel room could be anywhere and you have no idea what day or time it is. Until you know where you are and how much time you have, planning is impossible. When the mysterious woman leaves, rather than heading for the door, the first thing you might logically do is to throw open the curtains. The results determine your next step. If you see the familiar skyline of Edinburgh, you can proceed at once to make and implement plans; if the vista before you is the clutter and bustle of an industrial town in Asia, you may need to learn more before planning becomes possible; if you see two moons setting in a pink sky above a cityscape of glittering domes, and the beings walking alongside the canal nearby have pointed ears and green skin, the one thing you know for certain is that the trip to Trafalgar Square is going to be interesting!<br><br>Now imagine the same scenario, except that the landscape outside has the pink sky, two moons, and alien promenaders, and the mysterious woman tells you that you have to get to <span style="font-style: italic">the local equivalent</span> of Trafalgar Square by <span style="font-style: italic">the local equivalent</span> of New Year’s Eve. All hope of planning has just gone out the window. Your only option is to improvise as you go, try as many options as possible, collect tidbits of information, and attempt to piece together what you learn into a workable mental model. Nor will you have any way of knowing whether your model is right or wrong until you fling yourself out of an ornate airboat, sprint up to the giant bas-relief of Gresh the Omnivorous at Roong Thisdara right at the purple of the high red of twelfth Isbil past Eshrey of the rising calendar, and find the person you need to meet waiting there for you.<br><br>Conventional ideas of planning tend to assume situations like the first scenario I’ve just outlined, where the problem and the potential solutions are both clearly visible and the only issue is how to connect them. More innovative ideas of planning – and it’s to the credit of the peak oil scene that these latter have been very well represented there – tend to assume situations like the second scenario, where investigation must precede planning, and then follow along the planning process to keep it on track, rather like a herdsman’s dog trotting alongside a flock of sheep. As I see it, though, the situation we face at the end of the petroleum age most resembles the third scenario, where all we have to go on is a relatively vague idea of what a solution might be like, success or failure can be known only in retrospect, and improvisation is the order of the day.<br><br>The core fact of the matter, after all, is that what we are trying to invent here – a society that can support some approximation of modern technology on a sustainable basis – has never existed on Earth. We have no working models to go by; all we have, again, is a mix of agrarian practices that seem to have been sustainable, on the one hand, and some experiments that seem to be working so far on a very small scale, on the other. Our job is to piece something together using these, and other things that don’t exist yet, to cope with future challenges we can only foresee in the most general terms. That leaves us, in terms of the metaphor, looking for Roong Thisdara when the only thing we know about it is that it’s roughly equivalent to Trafalgar Square.<br><br>Now of course it’s quite possible to imagine post-industrial communities and societies in a fair amount of detail, and several imagined futures of this sort have found enthusiastic followings. The fact that something can be imagined, though, does nothing to prove that it will work. It’s not too hard to envisage a perpetual motion machine, say, or an investment that keeps on gaining value forever, and as we’ve seen, it’s quite possible to build a substantial social movement around belief in the latter, only to find out the hard way that attractive visions and passionate beliefs can rest on foundations of empty air. I recognize that many people find belief in such visions a powerful source of hope in a difficult time, and I sympathize with their feelings, but if we allow the desire for emotional comfort to trump the need to face unwelcome realities, we are in very deep trouble indeed.<br><br>There is actually a third irony to all this. As mentioned above, the last round of energy crises in the 1970s saw a great deal of energy go into making plans. A great deal of energy also went into improvisation, in a wide range of fields – notably alternative agriculture, renewable energy, and home design and construction. The plans have been forgotten; I don’t know of a single one that was still in force a decade down the road. The improvisations, on the other hand, have not; they include today’s organic intensive gardening, permaculture, most of today’s arsenal of solar energy methods, a range of alternative homebuilding methods, and much more.<br><br>Nobody drew up plans to develop these things, after all; the developers simply developed them, working things out as circumstances demanded, and shared what they learned with others as they went. Thus nearly all the ingredients being inserted into the current crop of plans for the deindustrial future were themselves the product of improvisation. It might be worth suggesting on this basis that our best option would be to skip the plans altogether and get to work on more improvisations.<br><br>All the points made here can be phrased in another way: a society is more like an organism than an artifact, and while artifacts can be planned and manufactured, organisms must evolve. This last point, though, presupposes an understanding of the difference between evolution and the ideologies that have sometimes been dressed up in evolution’s cast-off clothing – an issue that will be central to next week’s post.

(I wanted to put ironic quotation marks around so many words in that last sentence, it would've looked ridiculous.)<br><br>That's part of what I was getting at in my comment last week - there is no longer any such thing as society, and an attempt to pretend there is and plan based on that, how to "save" it (yup, I coildn't resist), is just naive sentimentalism and nostalgia, bound to be futile.<br><br>That's why right from the start I've been opposed to every increment of the ransom policy, this attempt to prop up the exponential debt economy.<br><br>(Everyone keeps blathering about appeasing Wall St, soothing its hurt feelings; maybe if, on the contrary, those criminals had been dealt a severe NO with no recourse right from the start, while the pain might have been worse at the outset, the inevitable decline would be proceeding more stably.)<br><br>So the way I see it is, our plans should focus on ourselves, our friends and families, trying to build our own Noah's Ark communities, being prepared to defend them (There's a point where many in the movement are dangerously naive, simply on account of their anti-gun bigotry.), and trying to preserve whatever of knowledge and culture is worth preserving. (I've read what you've written on that point.)<br><br>This all makes me think of Orlov's Five Stages of Collapse: financial, commercial, political, social, cultural.<br><br>He thinks the first three cannot be salvaged, and indeed implies that those deserve to go down.<br><br>But he thinks that social collapse (i.e. losing faith even in family and friendship, taking a truly Hobbesian state of nature attitude) can be prevented if we're willing to draw a line there and fight to defend that line.<br><br>That's also how I see things.<br><br><a href=looking-for-roong-thisdara.html#c1345901707134921264 title="comment permalink">11/27/08, 1:17 AM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c1719681860383869639></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/10480434159688352150 rel=nofollow>Lloyd Morcom</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>I've just held the second meeting for those interested in the Peak Oil problem in my small town in Australia, and there was no shortage of talk, but in terms of action we found it impossible to move on.<br><br>Part of the issue is the format. You have a problem, so you form group. The group decides on strategies, lobbies the correct institutions, achieves measurable outcomes. But it's still the same game, the game of politics within the enclosing game of Industrial Civilisation.<br><br>Having been a keen student of utopian schemes for most of a lifetime I've learned to see the pattern. An incisive, brilliant analysis of the ills of the dominant paradigm. A rousing call to action. And then a pale, flaccid proposal with all the earnestness of a church mission to save the heathens of China.<br><br>Industrial civilisation has been a wonderful game with more winners than we've ever had before. It's been possible to fight and win without having the slightest understanding of the intricate workings great swelling tide of energy that has carried even the most indolent of us along in some degree of comfort.<br><br>What is difficult to get our heads around is that nature in its implacable and merciless impartiality is about to toss the whole game in the bin, and we're going to have to invent a new game, or new games, from scratch, just at the moment when we've reached the absolute pinnacle of control freakery.<br><br>In Australia we've replaced an ageing and mean spirited control freak of a Prime Minister with a younger, sharper control freak with a strong Christian authoritarian bent. He's a man focussed on process with a capital P. A last apostle of the evangelical faith in rationality, education, planning and comformity with the rule of Saints—ahem! technical experts.<br><br>Watching this last attempt to cling to the dream will be like watching some beautiful sandcastle dissolve from the bottom as the tide comes in. Most of my countrymen and women are looking at the battlements with their fluttering pendants, not at the basement in the process of dissolution.<br><br>And so I have very limited hopes for my little group. I think the best we can do is inform as many as we can what the realities facing us are, and each seek our own salvation. May a hundred flowers bloom! May a hundred schools of thoughts contend! And hopefully some will set viable seed. But I'm very much afraid it will be nature which picks the winners.<br><br><a href=looking-for-roong-thisdara.html#c1719681860383869639 title="comment permalink">11/27/08, 1:41 AM</a><br><br>
<div class=avtb id=c3717964903907241988></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/00627270393248813976 rel=nofollow>Danby</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>JMG,<br>I especially agree with your last paragraph. <br><br>Planned societies, and I mean every single effort at building a planned society, ends in failure. The least damaging sort of failure is the failure to meet the plan. The most damaging failure of planned societies is to achieve their plan. Think Soviet Russia, Communist Albania, Khmer Rouge.<br><br>And, for the Software Engineer, I have some experience here too. HAve you ever worked a project where the specification for the software changes on a weekly basis? I have, and the software was never finished. That's what trying to plan for Peak Oil will be like. How do you plan for the rise of a Christian Neo-Fundamentalism, or chronic low-intensity warfare, demographic replacement,? How do you plan for the equivalent of Potato Blight, Mao's Cultural Revolution, the Civil War? Any one of these things will have a far greater and much more urgent impact on any town than peak oil, over the short term.<br><br>Also, let me ask, how do you debug a society? A computer program is an extremely simple thing compared to a human society. The language is well defined, each term has a precise meaning, and the number of things that can be done is quite limited. Yet, in developing and testing an application, you will encounter race conditions, infinite loops, system hangs and crashes. Something as simple as omitting a semicolon, or even indenting incorrectly can cause any of these. When they happen, you can, <i>in extremis</i> reboot the system. <br><br>The same concepts apply to societies as well. We are right now experiencing the collapse of a race condition in the credit markets. a credit leak rather than a memory leak. It may soon result in a systemic crash. How does one reboot a human ecology? An economy? A society?<br><br>And every software engineer should know about modularity. Instead of writing a single block of 5 million lines of code and hoping it all works (Windows), one properly writes 1,000 small, well-defined modules, and hooks them together to make what you need (Unix).<br><br>Within 40 years, every single TT plan will be functionally useless, and the most of the political structures put in place for Peak Oil now will be utterly forgotten. Indeed, most of them that do survive will have been turned into projects to deal with the oncoming Greater Depression.<br><br>What we need to be doing is building families, farms, and small business that can weather <b>whatever</b> comes, including Peak Oil, not planning for a future that cannot even be properly described.<br><br><a href=looking-for-roong-thisdara.html#c3717964903907241988 title="comment permalink">11/27/08, 2:43 AM</a><br><br>

While it is a book about randomness there are several good take away messages from the book (in addition to the main theme) that apply here.<br><br>1. Human beings don't really understand the world we live in.<br><br>2. We know less than we think we know. Experts are even worse about this than the average person. We assume that we know more than we do, apply that knowledge in some system or invention. Something that falls outside of that knowledge creates a problem at some point in the future that is unpredictable and potentially catastrophic. <br><br>3. The most amazing and greatest innovations in human history have come by people finding something they weren't looking for. (Chemotherapy came from observations about the side effects of mustard gas)<br><br>So I think Mr. Taleb would say about this issue is for us to move in the general direction of "sustainability" and be open to serendipity. Create redundancy in how we get our needs, be less concerned with the optimum and more concerned with the robust, look at what worked in the past and use that, tinker with new ideas but don't rely on them (use the tried and proven) which will give you a system that functions while allowing unlooked for and unexpected outcomes from tinkering.<br><br><a href=looking-for-roong-thisdara.html#c5713027001664546183 title="comment permalink">11/27/08, 5:44 AM</a><br><br>

I scoured the college catalogs, looking for a good program, and I noticed something along the way that has stuck with me ever since: No credit hours earned in any biology course would be counted toward the total needed to graduate as any kind of engineer by engineering licensing agencies. Being a lifelong amateur of biology, I decided pretty soon against engineering.<br><br>What we have done is to train generations of engineers to be totally ignorant of life, how it works, and what we can learn from it. (Is this a cause, or a result, of the engineering ethic of "Git 'er done!"?) Life forms on this planet have been at work for about 4 billion years, and have evolved amazingly intricate, elegant, and effective solutions to the problems they encountered - solutions our esteemed "scientists" are only just beginning to notice, much less understand.<br><br>We - all life - have only one source of profit on this planet, and that is incoming solar energy. We - all life - <i>must</i> depend only upon that energy if we are to survive for more than an evolutionary eyeblink. While the total of that energy is huge, in 4 billion years life has managed to capture only a tiny portion of it, with an "efficiency" that is appalling to an engineer. Thanks to exploiting reservoirs of that energy accumulated over hundreds of millions of years, we - humanity - have been getting upwards of 30 units of energy back for each unit "invested" - thirty bucks on the dollar, so to speak. Now, though, we gotta get used to getting more like a nickel (or less) on a dollar.<br><br>I wish I could recommend letting the biologists take charge, but look at what they're doing with GMOs, stem cells, nanotech, and so on ... We have so little knowledge, much less understanding, of what's going on in these areas. (Until very recently, the conventional wisdom had it that only 5% or less of a genome is genetically active, the remainder being genetic "junk". Don't you believe it. Nature does not invest all that energy and material over eons of time on "junk." What they should have said was, "We don't have a clue as to why this stuff is there, so we're going to ignore it and go full steam ahead anyway.") It reminds me very much of the Manhattan Project. Yeah, we <i>can</i> do it, but do we really want to?<br><br>So we really are up the creek in Roong Thisdara.<br><br><a href=looking-for-roong-thisdara.html#c2991389534305861741 title="comment permalink">11/27/08, 5:52 AM</a><br><br>

That's what Transition Towns are about. Regular mainstream society can't do that yet, but a Transition Town can.<br><br>I would say this first step - equivalent to waking up and opening the curtains perhaps, in your story - is necessary but not sufficient for building this 'society that can support some approximation of modern technology on a sustainable basis' that we all are hoping to see in a few centuries' time.

They provide a context for the improvisations that you're wanting, which can't take place otherwise.

Just kind of a short one.<br><br>I think these 70s plans were like great symphonies written for orchestras that were already vanishing - whereas what we need now is a little tune that anyone can hum. Then from that we can start embellishing it a little - maybe in a couple of centuries, it'll sound pretty grandiose, but we're not looking for that at this stage.<br><br>What I do sense in this week's post which I agree with so strongly, is a certain air of anticipation and interest, perhaps even excitement, about what might come up once the big thought-cages lift and we just start muddling. I also am rather interested in what happens when we do that, and find myself excited about things that our culture would normally find very unexciting. I just think that the TT approach to future visualization *is* in fact a part or a sort of muddling.

The word "sustainability" is often thrown around as if a human civilization will exist <i>forever</i>. Let's not lie to ourselves here. We are not looking to exist forever. We are looking for a way to survive on the Earth so that we can continue our spiritual evolution and gain the experience needed from living on this planet. Sustainability is about getting back into "earth" time and cycles, which is extremely slow. Not living forever. The Earth must die, and so will we. Sustainability is about living at the pace that the Earth lives at so as not to exploit it in our search for our own growth. This way, our growth assists the Earth's growth, and there is an exchange.<br><br>Second, I think that planning does make sense, however not in the way that many currently do it. One of the problems of our current model of existing is that we pit ourselves against the world and against each other. The neoliberal worldview (which by the way is the worldview that many of us embrace even when we think we don't) sees the human being as being at war with the natural world. This is a totally skewed vision of humanity. Humanity is indeed at war, but this war is an internal war. The human is at war with him/her self.<br><br>What we will see with the collapse of industrial society will be like many openings or cracks in the hegemonic worlview. When these openings show themselves, that is when we act. Planning is important. But acting before the time is right will create a disaster. As cracks in the current worldview open up, what those of us who want to direct change should be doing is taking those opportunities to bring focus and attention to a worldview that recognizes the internal struggle of humankind. Internalizing the war (which is where it naturally takes place, anyway) is the most sustainable way of living possible. We are not to be dumping our problems on the land. We are to be working through these issues (the battles within the war) and growing spiritually. This growth is what the Earth requires for us to remain here.<br><br>Love and Light<br>Mat<br><br><a href=looking-for-roong-thisdara.html#c8589618461406474551 title="comment permalink">11/27/08, 2:33 PM</a><br><br>

The wood stove is an investment in a 'hard times' scenario, where gas and electricity, or the money to pay for them, are scarce.<br><br>3.

'RAD', which is much like structured tinkering, for software development. Or adaptive management, which picks up on the scientific method and applies it to resource management.

The short form is that certain broad outlines can be anticipated, but the details can't -- and it's the details that upset any attempt to deliberately plan a future. Please reread those last four words, by the way -- that's what I'm talking about when I critique planning. <br><br>Wylde, you can find the internet in SF all the way back to E.M. Forster's "The Machine Stops," which dates from 1909; there are other SF versions of it all through the intervening years, culminating in John Brunner's <i>The Shockwave Rider</i> (1975), which predicted internet viruses (Brunner calls them "tapeworms"), hackers, and a great deal of contemporary web culture. <br><br>Mary, live theater is a very likely growth industry, so your daughter is making a good choice! I do think that it's worth thinking centuries ahead, though -- what we save today will make up a sizable fraction of what our descendants will have to work with then. <br><br>Nnonth, as mentioned earlier, I think the Transition Town movement is a worthwhile experiment, and I don't recall ever saying that things were set in stone! My concern is that the effort put into making a plan would be better directed elsewhere; those plans gathering dust in city archives are on my mind. Also, the alphabet metaphor misleads, because it assumes a linear progression: A, B, C, and so on. What if the third step should be Gamma rather than C? Or a Chinese character? <br><br>Archmage, exactly -- and there's some doubt that it's physically possible for the project to meet those ever-changing specifications at all. <br><br>Bryant, good. I'll be discussing this more in a future post on the way Taleb's ideas interface with peak oil. <br><br>Dean, when you insist that nobody else has the vision (or, as you put it, "Vision") to see the options you do, you sound like you're making a sales pitch for an ideology -- and it's a sales pitch many of us have seen before.

I have been on my towns climate action planning committee for a year, and have been aghast that no one can agree that the town needs to tell the selfish McMansion builders to stop because such intrusion will create ill feelings.<br>At the same time, the people creating CSAs, working on new energy organizations and the like share the intent to make life happier for all. Is the intent of the plans a genuine hope that the proposed direction will increase the happiness of most people? <br>The biggest change that is happening in America is many people's discovery that many of the plans that they were conned into supporting had the underlying intent to insure an individual or a groups prosperity, at the expense of others.<br>I suspect after a certain number of bankers have been strung from the lamp posts, the public at large will be more receptive to new directions than you suspect at this moment.<br><br><a href=looking-for-roong-thisdara.html#c6143243575599074739 title="comment permalink">12/2/08, 2:11 PM</a><br><br>

That is the secret of their success.”<br><br>The reason for this is simple: Historically, people who were more successful (rich, powerful, famous to any degree) were much more reproductively successful (counting ALL their children and grandchildren) and to an extreme degree (Genghis Khan with 30 million descendants). Any biologist will tell you that quite small differences in reproductive success will quite quickly drive a species in a particular direction.<br><br>Thus humans are hard-wired to seize any opportunity for personal gain and to do so if necessary on a semi-unconscious level so that they do not have to admit to themselves what they are doing. Ever wonder why almost any new-age religious movement soon becomes organized around the primary principle of the founder having unlimited sexual access to the young women in his flock?<br><br>In other words, any planning or development process will be seized and corrupted by those seeking personal gain of some sort. A good example of course being the redesigning of the USA financial system over the last 3 or 4 decades: It was entirely redesigned to allow insiders to obscenely enrich themselves, despite the fact that it must have been obvious to any half-intelligent observer that those very changes would eventually destroy it and perhaps cripple the USA.<br><br>Which leaves this huge tragedy: Sensible planning can vastly reduce human suffering, but any attempt at planning will be seized and corrupted by those pushing their own agenda with the result that the final plan will probably finish up making things worse.<br><br>Oh for a well designed AI or a benign alien without the destructive human instincts.<br><br><a href=looking-for-roong-thisdara.html#c5325137785881198151 title="comment permalink">12/3/08, 3:50 PM</a><br><br>

We just need to live within the "current solar budget". We have plenty of deserts and plains for solar and wind farms. We just need to improve the cost/kw of solar and wind technology by another factor of 2-4, double the efficiency of the the electric grid and decrease our total energy consumption by a factor of 5 or so and something like our current civilization can continue.<br><br>If everyone north of Alabama had to limit their use of air conditioning to 2 months per year it wouldn't be the end of the world.<br><br>We may not have dishwashers, we may bike more than we drive, we may ditch aluminum cans and go back to glass bottles, we may not eat apples from New Zealand but we'll still have books and music and we'll still have computers. But all the machines we do have will have to be a lot more energy efficient.<br><br>To get some ideas how it might be done, I recommend "Cradle to Cradle" by William McDonough and Michael Braungart.<br><br>As for planning the future, real futurists and strategic planners will tell you that you don't plan the future. You forecast likely futures and plan your present actions to optimize the possible outcomes.

<div class="avtb a_56cd25_56x70" id=c587866388444272966></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/03267725295392723513 rel=nofollow>LeoBro</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>I'm the software guy whose comment you responded to. I get your point. You are quite right that plans conceived in an intellectual vacuum are useless. Attempting to plan to solve problems when the problems are largely still unknown is foolish. Who knows what the world is going to look like even a year from now? Even when plans created in a vacuum actually succeed in the narrow sense, the law of unintended consequences often brings about results that are worse than the original situation.<br><br>But two concerns remain: 1) Your understanding of what the Transition groups mean by planning, and their overall motivation, is incorrect. Attempting to preconstruct a detailed, locked-in plan of the future is NOT what Transition is about. 2) Planning, designing and visioning, as they are meant by Transition, can be useful. While your example brilliantly demonstrates the circumstances in which planning is useless, it progresses through a false dichotomy (everything is knowable and planning is meaningful vs. not everything is knowable and planning is useless) to a straw man argument (in certain cases planning is impossible, therefore all planning is useless or counterproductive). <br><br>It is true that this thing called "Transition" began as an exercise in a permaculture class to create an "energy descent action plan," and because of that, it's easy to assume that planning is at the heart of the transition movement. However, if you pick up Rob's book, or even visit the various websites, you'll see it is much more about engaging your local community to find its own ways to become more resilient. Tinkering and improvisation are embedded in the culture of Transition, since no one has yet succeeded in making this transition. The development of an action plan is only one component of a broad spectrum of activities; and even with that, the emphasis is on the process more than the outcome.<br><br>I just attended a two-day Transition Training in Victoria, B.C. and I learned something I didn't know, and the presenter that you saw probably didn't know. The Transition Network team in England no longer use the phrase "Energy Descent Action Plan;" they changed the last word to "Pathways" – precisely for the reason you identified.<br><br>You held up permaculture as a worthwhile approach (permaculture good, planning bad). One of the first guidelines of permaculture is to spend at least a year observing a system before making any changes. Only then, armed with the wisdom of the interactions in place, does the designer start the design. The design is worked out carefully to maximize relationships, minimize waste, and meet as many other principles as possible. The design is then implemented, tested, and adjusted as needed. This is what Transition people mean by designing or planning. Although it might be necessary to improvise a solution in cases where the designer really doesn't know what might work and what won't, it's incorrect to say that improvisation is central to permaculture. <br><br>Rob Hopkins, who founded the Transition movement, is a permaculture designer and teacher himself, who began Transition as project in a permaculture class. Transition is therefore informed by holistic, systems thinking, design, implementation and constant revision.<br><br>Planning is not counter-productive when it's informed by careful observation of the circumstances, and when it is not treated as written in stone. The plan is the design, and without a design – without knowing where you want to end up -- you can hardly expect get there. <br><br>In my city (Seattle), there's already an abundance of environmental groups and promoters of "sustainability", and all of them are busy with lots of activities like promoting bicycling and encouraging better home insulation. That's all great, but to me, that does not seem like enough to address the severity of our present crises. What appealed to me about Transition, in reading about it, was that they wanted to actually think about energy descent in the long term. If the water coming into our houses requires electric pumps, what happens if there's no electricity? <br><br>It was that emphasis on gathering with others in the community to address contingency planning that excited me. In case of fire, I'd rather have an escape route planned (along with ability to improvise) than no plan at all. <br><br>The first project that Rob kicked off was the creation of a twenty-year plan. He did not mean to suggest that anyone could plan the next twenty years without having a crystal ball. He was suggesting that it's useful to take a stab at making projections based on what we know. For example, if we assume that in five years, petroleum costs five times what it does now, where will we get our food?<br><br>Your Roong Thisdara story brilliantly demonstrates that planning is impossible without enough data. But with regard to my water supply, for example, there are several things I do know. 1) I need water. 2) The grid might break down some day. That's sufficient information to start creating contingency plans to mitigate the concern. Even if the plan never proves necessary, or even if it doesn't work the way we imagined, the process of creating the plan may well prove useful in some unknown way.<br><br>When I brought up the example of designing software, I did not mean to imply that a programmer could completely plan a project and then expect to simply follow that plan and have everything work out. It doesn't work that way; requirements constantly change. Actually, I believe that developing software is about planning for unexpected change. Modular design is an approach to designing software so that changes don't have unexpected consequences. Planning for change. But it still seems self-evident that you can't get anywhere without some kind of vision for where you want to go. <br><br>Now, we may be talking apples and oranges. You revealed here that, in your view: "what we are trying to invent here [is] a society that can support some approximation of modern technology on a sustainable basis." So my apologies for misunderstanding, because that's not the problem I'm working on personally. My concern, and I believe, that of the Transition movement, is to somehow back out of this dead end street known as empire culture and into a way of life that works within natural limits and with compassion. Not only because we are being forced into it by the reality of energy descent, but also because we yearn for that. We're searching for a way of life that is more in keeping with our nature, and who we want to be.<br><br>That said, in all honesty: I have been guilty myself of rating the value of planning too highly. Your previous post, along with a few other influences, helped nudge me into a view that puts process and planning in better balance. So, thank you for your insights.<br><br><a href=looking-for-roong-thisdara.html#c587866388444272966 title="comment permalink">12/5/08, 10:49 AM</a><br><br>

The IT world is full of the successes made by visionaries. Vision followed by determination and good planning is the basis of success. Of cause the pathway is also littered with failures. <br>Not embarking on the path towards a vision for a better future and the steps towards it's implementation out of fear to be overtaken by some new emerging reality is foolish. Succeed we must on a path to sustainable future as obviously failure is not an survivable option for the generations just around the corner. And if new technology should emerge to make this path easier it will be embraced.<br><br>In regards to our current predicament: we have lots of data and lots of knowledge and we are in no way in a farcical situation like the Arch Druid's dilemma of a traveler stranded on a strange planet. We know our planet and the perils we have put upon it very well. Now let's get on with cleaning up the mess.
