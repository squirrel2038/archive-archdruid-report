I’d meant to talk in this week’s <span style="font-style: italic">Archdruid Report</span> post about the <a href=http://www.plancconference.org>peak oil conference</a> I attended last weekend in suburban Detroit. Still, that will have to wait for next time, as last night’s election results deserve a comment of their own.<br><br>Mind you, I intend to leave the political implications for others to discuss. The separation of church and state has been denounced by far too many people, on the left as well as the right, who have forgotten that it was originally put there to protect churches from political interference, not vice versa. It is nonetheless one of the essential foundations of the religious liberty that enables me to practice my Druid faith; one of the lessons I draw from this is that, as the head of a religious organization, I have the civic duty to keep my mouth shut about matters of partisan politics. There will no doubt be a banquet of political discussion in the months ahead of us lavish enough to satisfy even the most eager palate.<br><br>What I want to discuss just now, though, has less to do with the candidates in the presidential election now ended, than with the millions of ordinary people who filed into polling places yesterday and decided between them. All through the last two years or so, since Barack Obama began what seemed at the time like an improbable quest for the US presidency, one concern expressed repeatedly by the media and ordinary people alike was the possibility that the election would end up being about the issue of race. In a certain sense, that was indeed what happened – but in a very unexpected sense.<br><br>Some four decades after the assassination of Martin Luther King, the American people had the chance to judge an African-American candidate, in King’s words, not by the color of his skin but by the content of his character – and by and large, they rose to that not inconsiderable challenge. There may well have been some who voted for Obama because of his ethnic background, just as there were doubtless some who voted against him for that reason; but even among those who voted for his opponent, there were many who did so not because of Obama’s race, but simply because they disagreed with his policy proposals, just as if he were any other candidate.<br><br>That is an achievement of immense scope. It may just turn out that this nation has at long last begun to heal the old wound of racial hatred that has riven America right down to its core since the first days of European settlement. So deep a wound will not close at once; as Wendell Berry pointed out some years ago in a book too rarely read, the scar tissue of the racial divide reaches all through our national psyche, on all sides of the various color lines that still wall us away from each other – and from ourselves. Still, it’s no little thing that a majority of voters in Virginia, the heart of the old Confederacy; in Indiana, where a quarter of all adult males belonged to the Ku Klux Klan a mere seventy years ago; and in this nation as a whole, voted for the first time in history to send a black man to the White House.<br><br>We have no way of knowing in advance what kind of president Barack Obama will turn out to be, or how history will regard his tenure. He’s proven himself in a difficult campaign to be resourceful, energetic, thoughtful, and almost superhumanly cool under pressure, but many people have arrived at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue with abilities like these, and some of them have crashed and burned. Many of the cards in the hand he’ll have to play will be dealt him by decisions made months and years beforehand, or by circumstances nobody can control.<br><br>Still, a door has been opened, and I can’t help but think that America will be better off from the simple fact that the highest levels of its political system are no longer exclusively reserved to the fraction of its population that happens to be white. Nor is yesterday’s impact limited to issues of race; I think it almost certain that America’s first woman president will be inaugurated within a decade, and it’s even odds which of the two major parties will nominate her.<br><br>The broadening of the pool of potential talent this implies will be desperately needed in the years to come. It’s unfortunate, though it was probably inevitable, that the major issues of this moment in history were barely mentioned by any party, major or minor, in the presidential campaign. Over the next decade or so, the United States will have to work out a way to stand down from a global military-economic empire it can no longer afford to maintain; it will have to find the money and the means to replace a mostly fictive economy based on the manipulation of baroque financial instruments with a real economy based on the production of goods and services for people; it will have to make good on decades of malign neglect inflicted on the national infrastructure on nearly every level, even as it struggles to convert a suburban landcape viable only in an age of cheap abundant fossil fuels to something that makes sense in the world of scarce and expensive energy ahead of us.<br><br>Few of the changes that will be imposed by these necessities will be popular. Many, in fact, will be bitterly resented, and none of them will come cheaply. We have wasted so many opportunities and poured so many of our once-abundant resources into a decades-long joyride that the next few years will almost certainly impose one wrenching challenge after another on a society that the recent past has left very poorly equipped to face them. Our history is among the heaviest burdens we face, because the habits we learned during America’s imperial zenith are among the things that are most necessary to unlearn in the new and far more multipolar world dawning around us.<br><br>Still, I find myself feeling a bit more hopeful than before, for the burden of racial hatred was also profoundly rooted in American history and identity, and the verdict of last night’s election suggests that it has turned out to be subject to change. I think of the difference forty years has made, from 1968, when an assassin’s bullet cut down Martin Luther King and inner cities across America exploded in violence, to 2008, when a nation’s ballot sent Barack Obama to the presidency and many of those same inner cities celebrated straight through the night. We live in a different country now, and the possibility that Americans might be able to rise to the massive challenge of the deindustrial transition has become just slightly harder for me to dismiss out of hand. Still, that turn of history’s wheel is still ahead of us, and we will have to wait and see.

But it could polarise things <i>more</i> - if things don't work out as well as is so breathlessly hoped for, his race could be blamed rather than his policies. <br><br>Secondly, while racism and sexism are horrendous, not looked at is class. A country where the bottom fifth have (say) 5% of the wealth and the top 1% have 40% the wealth is not made more just and decent because half of the very poor and half of the very rich are women, or one-seventh of both are black. <br><br>Poverty is as oppressive as any Jim Crow law. Poverty creates segregation and degradation. That is what really needs to be addressed in the US and the world.<br><br><a href=#c5978806706608894592 title="comment permalink">11/5/08, 5:53 PM</a><br><br>

Yes it is a relevant discussion. (And being a white guy a year younger than Obama, and raised by parents the same age as his departed grandmother, I too am experiencing an unreasonable sense of pride in my country today.) However, even more relevant is the discussion of geography. Not regional Mason-Dixon or East-West geography, but local urban-rural geography. <br><br>Even in the reddest and bluest of states, when you look at the county maps, the pattern is amazing consistent. Obama carried virtually every urban area in the country, and McCain carried most of the counties with lower population densities. This is true of of Georgia, Texas, Oregon, California, New York, Pennsylvania, et. al. <br><br>I am not sure of the significance, but I believe there is something relevant. Have things finally got so crappy in cities across America that change was finally welcomed? Is the stereotype of redneck America really true? I am looking forward to the next year in a way I have not for a long time.<br><br><a href=#c294517593568906411 title="comment permalink">11/5/08, 6:06 PM</a><br><br>

McCain won Georgia by only 5% when all the votes were counted, and Texas by less than 10%. Obama is probably going to win North Carolina and lose Missouri by only about 6,000 votes. That is just an incredible number for the Deep South. There was a record number of democratic votes in most of the southern states; more young and non-white voters turned out to vote than ever before. There were raucuous celebrations all over the south. People took to the streets from Tampa to Missouri. The celebration here spilled out into so many streets the cops had to come out and clear them so traffic flow could resume. Here in Alabama an incumbent Republican member of the house was trounced by a democrat. <br><br>Dixie finally died Tuesday night, and the shock waves are still reverberating. The old white supremacists are reeling. People who are not from here really do not have much an idea of just how big a deal this is -we still have 'colored' signs in some of the bus stations! A move to remove the language of segregation from Alabama's constitution failed a couple of years ago. There's going to be a backlash of course, but what is done is done.<br><br>Coyote, one thing you need to look at is that rural counties are not monolithic; McCain may have one, but often it was a 60/40 split or less. Plenty of people in rural America voted for Obama.<br><br><a href=#c5052541697861562435 title="comment permalink">11/6/08, 4:58 AM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c1793875773714773070></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/08732100848570571207 rel=nofollow>Frank</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>I believe Obama offers the real possibility of change from the historical momentum that America has established over the past thirty eight years; the politics of division as first manifested by Nixon. There are many issues Obama did not address during the campaign. After all, there was an election to be won. We face daunting challenges like peak oil, resource depletion, over-population... Addressing those challenges in a peaceful way will require people able to perceive the problems as they exist. A large number of Americans still embrace technofantasy, or some bizarre interpretation of the real problems we face. I am encouraged by this election, and not only by the rhetoric of Obama, but even by the graciousness of McCain's concession speech. The rhetoric matters, but actions matter more. I hope we can all come together to work to create a strong positive, realistic vision of the future, and may we find the strength courage, wisdom and perseverance to make our positive vision a reality.

When I heard McCain's defeat and Obama's victory speeches I was completely marveled at their level of education and responsibility, more especially after finding out that Obama intends to put Republicans in some places of his government (we are lucky here if those places aren't filled with the president's own family members).<br><br>When Obama ends his period(s) would the people of USA be kind to loan them for us?<br><br><a href=#c5012940100960245214 title="comment permalink">11/6/08, 5:11 AM</a><br><br>

I'm looking foward of buying your new book at "Boarders" and will likely have a cup of coffee there and act "civilized".<br><br>The world is a much different place than what it was 40 years ago. At least, some of the racial barriers have been overcomed...<br><br>I would dare say, that 40 years from now, the world will not even look similiar as what it does today. Changes so great, that todays achievement or comparing the change in the span of the last 40 years, to be completely overshadowed. If not forgotten, or even relevant to someone like "Adam", in his day..<br><br>This could be the last Pesidential election (or what passes for it) and that thought is not lost upon me, at least.<br><br>I'll look foward to your story about Detroit...I hope you took the time to have been driven around the neighborhood.

I'm a Canadian and that deep wound in the American psyche is painfully obvious to me, it colours everything. We have racism and prejudice here in Canada too, but we didn't fight a war over it, we don't carry the wounds of it in quite the same way that all Americans do. I agree with you that Obama has breached a wall, made an opening for the light to shine through and the healing to begin. Let me re-phrase that, Americans have breached that wall. Obama was just the point man. He brings out the best in you.<br><br><a href=#c4593701697084824043 title="comment permalink">11/6/08, 5:58 AM</a><br><br>

I thought I'd be celebrating Tuesday night, but when New Mexico went blue and I knew (mathematically) that the election would go Obama's way as soon as the west coast weighed in, I felt only relief. Of course, we're in "overtime" here on Planet Georgia, with a senatorial runoff coming up on Dec. 2, so maybe I'll celebrate in a month.<br><br>Obama may not be able to fix all our problems — actually, I expect very little to get fixed until the Senate goes filibuster-proof in 2010, given the Republican penchant for obstructionism — but at least we know the problems will get air time and serious discussion. And who knows? Maybe the opposition will vote for their country instead of their party for a "change."<br><br>And… you know you're getting older when the President is a couple years younger than you.<br><br><a href=#c4446730637216842446 title="comment permalink">11/6/08, 6:15 AM</a><br><br>

What mattered about Tuesday's outcome, as I said several times, is not who got (or didn't get) elected, much less what he can be expected to do; it's the simple fact that a majority of American voters set aside the old bitter rhetoric of race and voted an African-American man into the nation's highest office. It's the change in attitudes among the people, not the change in personnel in the White House, that makes me a little more hopeful. <br><br>There's more to be said, but this will do for now.<br><br><a href=#c7524248345838323633 title="comment permalink">11/6/08, 9:27 AM</a><br><br>

In so far as race can even be said to exist, it exists only as a marker for membership in an ethnic or cultural group. Obama has dark skin, but he does not share much if anything in the culture of African Americans. His accent is plain White upper-Midwest. He is not the descendant of slaves, and he does not speak, move or think like one.<br><br>Perhaps the only way to get a Black man elected President this time around was to nominate one with dark skin but no cultural ties to or cultural markers of African Americans. If so, I think it says a lot less for our country.<br><br>Secondly, the major reason Obama won so handily was GW Bush. The absolute mess made of the economy and our relations with foreign countries (except of course Israel), the interminable wars in central Asia, the utter arrogance combined with utter cluelessness made it nearly impossible for a Republican to win this round. Particularly one who, like McCain, could only promise more of the Bush policies that America is so very tired of.

The more usual one is the hope that a Black president would finally push White Americans past some sort of tolerance limit and start the race wars they've been fighting in their heads since the 1950's. The second is the argument that a race-conscious Black is better for their cause than mutli-culturalism. The last, most practical one was a simple "better a competent Negro than an incompetent nutter with a pale face."<br><br><a href=#c4455925751709061453 title="comment permalink">11/6/08, 10:59 AM</a><br><br>

The database that was able to track every potential voter in real time and get timely information to an appropriate member of the Obama campaign is impressive (I build databases). Scary, but impressive! Ditto for the website!<br><br>This is one of those tipping points in history. For any future USA campaign to succeed it will have to be run like this.<br><br>On the plus side, this excludes all but the very intelligent and professional, on the minus side, it excludes anyone who does not have access to vast resources and the support of the likes of Facebook and Google.<br><br>Scary!<br><br>I was especially interested when lisa wrote "If an Obama administration is run even half as well as as the Obama campaign, then I have enormously high hopes for my country, even in the face of the greatest economic challenges it has faced in over 70 years."<br><br>That, of course, is the crucial point: Will that level of intelligence and professionalism be applied to government where, to the surprise of most people in the street, neither are usually much in evidence.<br><br>Just perhaps, maybe, there may finally be a move towards more truly intelligent, professional, scientific administrations. China may have started the fashion with the seeming metamorphosis of the tired, incompetent old Chinese Communist Party into a rather competent, semi democratic, soft fascist – sorry, Confucian party. The people of both Australia and the USA seem, in their last elections, to have tried to elect such administrations. Let’s hope they have succeeded.<br><br>Maybe there is hope for the world yet.<br><br>By the way, as for the stuff on the royals, I was originally a republican, sort of, but eventually came to believe that a well designed Constitutional Monarchy was generally better because it separated the political head of state (the prime minister / president) and the social head (the monarch) which keeps them both under control and, due to specialization, allows each to be better at their jobs (another separation of powers).<br><br>Also, importantly, when the political system and government collapses for awhile, which happens about once a century even in well run countries, there is a generally known and trusted authority to take care of things while the politicians are getting over their attack of hysterics (why reserve powers are important). Better yet, as the entire royal family should have been educated over generations to public service and to being the social, not political head of the nation, the monarch will have little interest in retaining power a moment longer than necessary to put the parliament back together.<br><br><a href=#c3616006672185605398 title="comment permalink">11/6/08, 5:29 PM</a><br><br>

To me, this is one example of one of the main factors that give me hope for the years ahead. There's a strong streak of pragmatism in Americans (or maybe just people in general), and once they start to accept a new reality, they often say "OK, the hard stuff's coming down, how do we deal with it?" For a couple of other examples, I see hope in my area in the resurgent interest in community gardens, and in grassroots political activism at the local level and beyond. Clearly folks rejected the "politics of nastiness" in a big way.<br><br>Also, I suspect that a major factor that propelled the Obama campaign, is that much of the money he raised was in small donations from large numbers of people, and I don't think that was by accident. Guess what, folks -- if politicians are "owned" by their big donors, maybe we own a piece of the new President! He even made some allusions to this in his acceptance speech: <br>"But above all, I will never forget who this victory truly belongs to. It belongs to you. It belongs to you."<br>"And I know you didn't do this just to win an election. And I know you didn't do it for me."<br>"And, above all, I will ask you to join in the work of remaking this nation, the only way it's been done in America for 221 years -- block by block, brick by brick, calloused hand by calloused hand."<br>"It can't happen without you, without a new spirit of service, a new spirit of sacrifice." (Did the man actually call for service and sacrifice? Can't we just go shopping?)<br>"So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism, of responsibility, where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves but each other." (Community, anyone? JMG, you responded to my comment last week that people have to change "in their own lives" first; I disagree. We're not islands, and the changes we make in our lives, and the changes others make that affect us, are interacting dynamics; our lives intertwine on many levels. I think the dramatic change in racial attitudes you noted in the main post is a demonstration of that.)<br><br>OK, so maybe this is just the usual hot air that politicians trot out to anaesthetize the masses.

I'll finish with a pointer to <a href=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/nov/06/barackobama-uselections20082 rel=nofollow>an essay</a> harking back to Obama's roots in community organizing, and point to the quote from FDR in it.

I can't think of an example from Europe, and, honestly, the notion of, say, a British PM of Indian origins or someone from African ancestry being elected in France is even harder to imagine than a black man being elected in the U.S. The magnitude of this election for what it says about the evolution of American society is enormous, far far beyond merely "symbolic." <br><br>Down here in Tennessee, it seems very much that the pro-McCain outcome was far more a result of the christian evangelical vote than racism. I think voters were more concerned (on both sides) with abortion, evolution, and the role of religion in government than they were about skin color; I suspect these are the places where Palin helped the ticket rather than hurting it. There's also the strong appeal of a combat veteran in this culture with deeply ingrained military traditions. Perhaps we have reached a circumstance where the fundamental divides in our society are about religion rather than race? Is this an "improvement?"

If Julian Bond had run for president against Satan himself in 1976 he still would not have carried North Carolina, Virginia, Florida, or the national electoral college. The important point is not any of the details of Obama's appearance, history, or genetic composition. What matters is that the vast majority of Americans of all races perceive him to be a Black Man, and still we elected him president.

For reasons that Danby mentioned (and there is no need to repeat), I personally wouldn't call him an 'African-American' any more than I would, in Europe, call the child of an Indian father and (say) Irish mother a Gypsy. <br><br>Now, granted, it is a step in the right direction that Americans managed to vote for Obama instead of simply going 'eeeeew!' at the sight of his skin color.

Where do Dravidians, or Negritos, or Aborigines fit into the "Black" race. For the most part they are darker than American Blacks, but they share no history and very little genetic heritage beyond that common to all. The Turks share a significant genetic heritage with the Japanese, but are radically different in most every important way from the Japanese. <br><br>I suppose the defining fact is that a great many Americans had to admit that Obama is an intelligent, thoughtful and well-spoken man of great energy and ambition. To the extent that they thought these attributes were somehow related to skin color, I suppose it is a victory over ignorance and stupidity.

What matters is that the large majority of Americans do see it as meaningful; for the last 516 years in fact it has been one of the core organizing concepts for virtually every single European-founded society that has existed in the New World. The question is not whether race is "real" but how this concept, "real" or constructed (all concepts are fundamentally constructed and abstracted, aren't they?), is viewed in a civilization. What I see having been demonstrated in this election is that the rest of America is shifting towards a position closer to the one you yourself personally express, which is undeniably a major break from the racial concepts that have permeated euro-based American civilization since its inception. <br><br>Daniel -- <br><br>You write, <i>"The simple fact of the matter is that we as a species can only live full, peaceful, productive lives once we eliminate ALL classifications (race, religion, nationality, social strata, etc.) from our vocabulary."</i> If this is true, then we might as well pack it in. Your dream has been a dream of idealists for millenia; it has never come to fruition and it seems unlikely that it ever will. Classification and separation is fundamental to human nature; it leads us to science, technology, art, language... and also to racism, nationalism, religious persecution, class divisions, etc. Saying we must transcend this is like saying we must grow wings. It is a part of human nature that must be accepted, recognized, and dealt with, not denied or wished away. Believing that peace and justice are not possible until we transcend all classifications and divisions is like believing that peace and justice are not possible until Jesus returns to earth.

It is the core of the Fascist philosophy, and that hasn't proven to work so well in practice as it might seem it would in theory.<br><br><a href=#c8052192945036100774 title="comment permalink">11/10/08, 9:09 AM</a><br><br>

It was an harrowing experience obtaining this book at Boarders on the edge of the University of Michigan, around noon time!

Well worth the experience though and I'm glad I didn't run over anybody! <br><br>Even though, I'm only a third through it, it'd dare say it's the closest representation of the reality (as I precieve it) about the "predicament" we're in.<br><br>I almost think, at times you wrote it for me.....Excellent! I'd like to highly recommend this book to all your readers! I'd dare say, there's a little something of all us in it!<br><br>Thanks, yooper<br><br><a href=#c5115069789077831371 title="comment permalink">11/10/08, 7:30 PM</a><br><br>
