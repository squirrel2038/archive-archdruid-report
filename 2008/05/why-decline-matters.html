One of the most curious blind spots in the contemporary imagination, as I have suggested more than once in these essays, can be traced in the way that the concept of decline has vanished from our collective discourse about the future. What makes this blindness even more curious is that it is a very recent thing.<br><br>A century ago the possibility that the modern western world might reach a peak, and then retrace history’s familiar path down to the common fate of civilizations, was on many minds. The art of Aubrey Beardsley and the novels of Joséphin Péladan, to name only two leading figures of the Decadent movement, announced, and at times wallowed in, the approaching decline that Oswald Spengler detailed a few years later in his magisterial prose. The belief in decline was never universally held, or even a majority view – those who prophesied the imminence of Utopia through progress or violent revolution had at least as large an audience, and apocalyptic fantasies were never hard to find – but the idea was there, and commanded attention from serious thinkers.<br><br>Somewhere between the 1920s and the end of the Second World War, however, the entire concept of decline dropped out of the modern world’s collective imagination. Except for a brief reprise in the wake of the converging crises of the 1970s, and a few manifestations on the far edges of today’s fringe culture, it has yet to return. This odd shift in the shapes of our imagined futures demands attention from those of us who try to sense the shape of the future in advance, because if the future we get is one of decline, the results could be far more challenging than anything the more simplistic notion of sudden collapse can offer<br><br>Decline, after all, is not a linear process. Trace the decline of the dead civilizations of the past along the dimension of time, and much more often than not it follows a complex, stairstep curve that alternates periods of crisis with respites and partial recoveries. Compare the process to the sort of sudden apocalyptic collapse that occupies so much space in the collective imagination today, and a striking result emerges: the amount of population decline and cultural loss in any given generation may be much less than would result from a single sudden catastrophe, but the overall impact of decline is much greater, and the capacity for swift recovery much less.<br><br>This seems counterintuitive, but it can easily be demonstrated by historical evidence and logic alike. Consider the Black Death in Europe. As an example of dieoff, it’s hard to beat – the first terrible epidemic of 1346-1351 killed close to a third of the population of Europe, and recurring outbreaks that followed every decade or so took up to ten per cent of the survivors each time – and, in the form of the peasant revolts of the late 14th century, it even managed to produce some semblance of the marauding hordes that play so large a part in contemporary survivalist fantasies. Despite the horrific death rate, the widespread social disorder, and the huge cultural impacts of the Black Death, European civilization did not collapse, or lose cultural continuity. The survivors simply picked themselves up and went on with things much as before.<br><br>Imagine a similar dieoff, or even a much more extreme one, in America today and it’s not hard to see why. Let’s say the most extreme versions of the peak oil survivalist thesis turn out to be correct; some crisis or other causes petroleum markets to freeze up completely, and gasoline and diesel fuel become completely unavailable; panic and looting set in, governments somehow fail to do anything about the crisis, and society unravels in a general war of all against all, with marauding hordes spilling out of the cities into nearby rural regions in a desperate quest for food. Five horrific years later, the US population has plummeted by 95%. What happens next?<br><br>The single largest resource base available to the survivors, in such a case, would be the material culture and knowledge base of pre-collapse society. All over rural America, in areas more than a few hundred miles from big urban centers, small towns and villages would remain, and those in agricultural areas with steady water supplies would likely flourish; lacking gas for their cars, after all, refugees from Chicago or Los Angeles will not make it to North Dakota, or even Iowa. Libraries, schools, and local governments would either still exist, or could be readily rebuilt; abandoned buildings and technology could be dusted off and put back to use; where renewable energy sources exist, those could be reactivated if they stopped running in the first place. Almost everyone alive after the collapse will have grown up in the precollapse world, and a great many of them will have learned some of the skills needed to operate a modern society. Before very long, something very like today’s rural American culture would have reestablished itself, just as late medieval cultures across Europe reestablished themselves after the Black Death.<br><br>What makes so swift a recovery possible, though, is the short time span between collapse and aftermath. Consider the possibility of decline and a much less promising picture emerges. First, and most obviously, decline takes much longer. By the time the process is finished, the people who remember how an advanced civilization used to function are long in their graves, and anything perishable in the material culture they knew has long since perished. It’s one thing to break into an abandoned library five years after a sudden collapse, when most of the books will be dusty but readable; it’s another thing to do the same thing two hundred years after the beginning of decline, when those books not looted long ago have crumbled into sawdust because they were printed on high-acid paper, or rotted after the roof collapsed and the rains got in.<br><br>The stairstep process found in most historical examples of decline, though, is a far more potent force. Periods of crisis, in which urgent needs absorb all available resources, can go on for decades. During that time, anything not immediately relevant to the needs of the moment will likely go begging for maintenance and upkeep, if it isn’t stripped for spare parts, burned as heating fuel, or destroyed in war, rioting, or any of the other common disasters that punctuate the downward arc of a civilization’s lifespan. Periods of respite offer some recovery time, but then another period of crisis comes and another sorting process hits the surviving legacy of the civilization. Each period of crisis thus becomes a bottleneck through which only a fraction of a civilization’s material culture and knowledge base will survive. Repeat the process often enough and very little remains. Thus, if we admit the possibility of decline, we face the possibility of a future more difficult and impoverished than a future of sudden collapse, not less so.<br><br>The cultural conserver concept I have proposed in recent weeks on this blog attempts to address that possibility. Alongside the dismal record of cultural loss during ages of decline, history also shows that a motivated minority concerned with the long view can have a disproportionate impact on the survival of cultural heritage in hard times.<br><br>Consider the survival of the Jewish people and their cultural heritage after the destruction of the Third Temple in 70 CE, and the obliteration of most of the Jewish presence in Israel over the following century. Faced with the very real risk of cultural extinction, surviving religious leaders drew on memories of the Babylonian captivity to launch one of history’s most magnificently successful programs of cultural conservation. As rabbinic Judaism took shape, a very large percentage of its traditions focused explicitly on preserving Jewish religious and cultural continuity. “Why is this night different from all other nights?” asks the Passover ritual; the answer, freely interpreted, is that it embodies one of the distinctive historical experiences of the Jewish people, using potent tools of symbol and ceremony to counter the pressures toward assimilation and absorption.<br><br>Equally, the Catholic church after Rome’s fall set in motion a massive salvage program that kept much of classical culture alive right through the Dark Ages. Its motives differed from those that drove the founders of rabbinic Judaism; an expanding church needed clergy literate enough to know their way around scripture, the church fathers, canon law, and the philosophical theology the Church had borrowed from Greek Neoplatonism, and this mandated the survival of the Latin literary culture that informed so much early Christian literature in the West. Thus generations of Christian schoolboys learned Latin prosody from Vergil, and acquired a taste for learning that blossomed in the great age of Christian monasticism and preserved countless cultural treasures for the future.<br><br>There are plenty of other examples, from the Sanskrit academies of India to the bardic schools of early modern Scotland, but they share a crucial feature in common with these. For a cultural tradition to survive in an age of decline, it needs to find a constituency that values it enough to put the survival of the tradition ahead of more immediate needs. In traditional Judaism, keeping the commandments isn’t something to file away for future reference whenever times get hard; it comes first, even ahead of personal survival. Similarly, the Benedictine monks who spent their time copying manuscripts by hand in unheated scriptoria through the worst years of the Dark Ages could have led much easier lives outside the bare walls of their monasteries, if the glory of God had not, in their eyes, outshone all the treasures of the world.<br><br>Thus the survival of cultural heritage must draw on emotional drives potent enough to override the tyranny of immediate needs and drive the modest but unremitting daily efforts needed to keep cultural heritage intact. This is especially true of the traditions of elite culture, which typically lack any short term survival value and often require a sizeable investment of time and resources. It is above all true of modern elite culture, which has specialized in the mass production of information to such a degree that the ability to maintain adequate storage for all the knowledge our culture has amassed is already very much in doubt.<br><br>One of my readers thus responded to last week’s post by asking me how her field, mathematics, might preserve some of its knowledge base for the future. That’s a daunting question, for which I know no easy answers. Right now mathematicians in the more abstract and less practical branches of their field can draw a salary to pursue their researches only because a longstanding social habit encourages governments and donors to cover the costs. The same thing is true of many other branches of scholarship, and of those fine arts that haven’t quite finished the process of devolving into the manufacture of high-end collectibles for the rich. Outside of university mathematics departments, it’s hard to find anyone who has even heard of most of today’s hot topics in math, much less anyone who would be willing to study and teach them in their off hours, for no pay, out of the sheer love of the subject.<br><br>That sort of constituency will be hard for any part of today’s elite culture to find, and without it, there’s a minimal chance that anything more than fragments of that culture will reach the future. Still, there is a wild card in the deck, and its name is religion. Nearly all the classic examples of cultural conservation have drawn their motivating force from religious beliefs. Is it possible that some of today’s scientific and cultural heritage will find a welcome within the ambit of a present or future religious movement? Next week’s post will explore these options.

Since the end of the cold war, most haven't been concerned about the "end of the world" as much as the "Jew in 1930s Germany" or "Bosnia 1990s" situation, which is more the end of our world as we know it. Being a news junky, this occupies my mind more often than not lately since anyone of us could find ourselves in that situation. Most of what the media would call "survivalists" just believe in stocked up pantries and gardens similar to what you have advocated. Yes, there are always firearms, but they are considered tools for an intended purpose similar to a kitchen knife. If we are headed for collapse or decline, the survivalists will be the ones who maintain the knowledge as you suggest since contemporary culture forgets the lessons of history. <br><br>As always, enjoyed the column immensely...but the survivalist label could also be applied to you, and it is a very derogatory term in mainstream America and someday one might be arrested for "being" one.

As I noted in<br>my comments on JMG's "Same New Ideas" essay, we could keep in<br>view the advisability of sparking library conservation<br>discussions at IFLA (http://www.ifla.org) or some similar<br>organization, and in this context we could ponder<br>etched-into-metal or etched-into-glass microform.

Micheal, I stand corrected: there are versions of the survivalist claim more extreme than the one I cited, and you apparently accept one of them. What will people eat? Well, let's start with crops grown using the seeds survivalists are so sedulously stockpiling right now, plus widely available wild foods, plus all the livestock and crops from all the farms too far from big cities for those imaginary marauding hordes to get to them -- and I could go on for some time. Even in an extreme subsistence crisis there's food to be had, for at least some survivors. You might want to research famines and dieoff phenomena in the past sometime for a bit of useful perspective. <br><br>JRC, please note that I spoke of survivalist fantasies, not of practical survival (or survivalist) strategies. I'm not talking about the people who are making sensible preparations for hard times, but about the people who are building horror-movie scenarios and using them as an excuse to do nothing. I still think most of the survival movement, in preparing for a fast crash, is shooting at a target that isn't there, but that's another matter. <br><br>Tom, the only reason I haven't pursued the discussion about libraries is that I don't have the technical knowledge to contribute much to it -- it's no lack of interest in that desperately important topic. Still, it seems to me that it's even more important to talk about building constituencies that will keep libraries viable through hard time, since books can't preserve or copy themselves! Some of next week's post may be of interest in that context, not least because I've mulled over some of your work on the subject more than once.<br><br><a href=why-decline-matters.html#c6522310178667120274 title="comment permalink">5/28/08, 9:56 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c4569622460017551754></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/05766761697820832190 rel=nofollow>Toomas (Tom) Karmo</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Dear John (JMG): <br><br>Thanks for your encouraging response (above), in which you call the topic of libraries "desperately important". <br><br>Heartened by your response, I'd like to offer two additional comments. <br><br>(i) In astronomy (and surely also in botany, or again in Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence) the library is a sine qua non for keeping the work going. We HAVE to be able to look up a star to see what it was observed to be doing in the past; we HAVE to be able to look up precedents as we try cases in an Anglo-Saxon ("common-law") jurisdiction. <br><br>(ii) Cosmologist Fred Hoyle makes haunting remarks on libraries in his essay "The Anatomy of Doom" (in his 1968 collection _Encounter with the Future_). Hoyle suggests that we face a time of decline, followed by a cultural revival, followed again by decline, and so on, in a process that ultimately encourages the survival of the more civic-minded, intelligent, and pacifist strains in the Homo sapiens gene pool. On libraries and the preservation of knowledge, he writes as follows:<br><br>((QUOTE))<br>It would be impossible to re-expand, at any rate after the first one or two cycles, if the whole of technology had to be rediscovered independently in every cycle. The first expansion, the one we are now living in, has important assets - coal, oil, high-grade metallic ores - that will not be available in later cycles. On the other hand, the later cycles will have the advantage of information from earlier times. Experience shows that knowledge dies very hard once it has been obtained - the acquisition of knowledge is essentially irreversible, a truth already recognized in the Garden of Eden. Not all of the multitude of libraries would disappear in the moments of catastrophe. Remnants would remain to be consulted by the survivors, or rather by survivors with the wits to consult them. Here is the selective factor. A serious re-expansion would not be possible except to the highly intelligent. Reading in a library is today merely the innocent pursuit of the scholar. In the future the ability to puzzle out the knowledge of the past will be decisive. Knowledge, organization, the library, these are the environmental factors that will determine the future. It may seem strange to the biologist to think of the library as a major environmental factor, but I think the strangeness comes form the newness of the concept rather than from any new principle.<br>((/QUOTE))<br><br>Hoyle's language here is disconcertingly collapsist ("survivors", "catastrophe"), but his general point is an interesting one: in conditions of social strain, access to library resources will make the difference between living well and living poorly, even as will access to medical care and clean water. <br><br>Perhaps some readers who are librarians will be impelled by this pair of remarks to post comments of their own?<br><br><br>Hopefully, <br><br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo<br>http://www.metascientia.com<br><br><a href=why-decline-matters.html#c4569622460017551754 title="comment permalink">5/28/08, 11:18 PM</a><br><br>

But one of the considerations of the slow vs. fast collapse scenarios I've read is how much the biosphere will be damaged in a slow decline vs. a fast collapse. That is, some ecologically informed bloggers are hoping for a fast, sudden, catastrophic collapse in order to remove enough people, and therefore the pressures on other species, to enable the biosphere to stabilize enough to enable some humans to survive.<br><br>The scenario of a slow decline that you sketch focuses on cultural conservation, but I am also concerned with bio- and eco-conservation. It's going to be hard enough for the biosphere to sustain human life with global warming, even if industrial society ceased belching out greenhouse gases today and half the humans disappeared (as in a sudden, catastrophic collapse). But if we have a slow decline that enables overpopulation (currently 3+ times as many humans as the biosphere can support) to continue for a few more generations, it is quite possible that the current biological holocaust will escalate to the point of absolute ecological meltdown, leaving the planet a desert and the oceans dead. What then will be left for humans to survive on? <br><br>The current dangers to the biosphere, which are already very worrying, I believe, makes the slow decline of industrial civilization more dire than the slow declines of past civilizations, in which the oceans still had fish, the topsoils were still fertile, the rivers still ran with potable water, and the rainforests of the planet still breathed. Personally, it is hard for me to imagine a future in which cultural conservation will matter, if the current destruction of the web of life continues.<br><br>Know what I mean?<br><br>Best,<br><br>Suzanne<br><br><a href=why-decline-matters.html#c4149863521802576040 title="comment permalink">5/29/08, 6:00 AM</a><br><br>

That there's no point in going on?' asked Thirza.<br> "No. Only that we pay attention. That we force ourselves to remember. It's easy to look down from this lofty height at the struggling remnants of a glorious past and wonder how they let it happen. All gone, extinct. Not a clue. No racial memory left intact. Why? How?

I agree that in the past this has largely been the case. However, it seems to me that for Western Culture the role of religion has now largely taken a back seat to the belief in capitalism, free markets, and good ol' ingenuity. This may in part be due to my suspicion that humans tend to congratulate themselves and their own abilities when things are going well and then tend to look for outside (divine?) reasons when things go very poorly -- and by poorly I am talking about the extremes of war, weather related disasters, famine, market collapses, etc. As a general once said, 'There are no atheists in a foxhole.'<br><br>Perhaps I am getting ahead of myself as you mentioned at the bottom of your last entry that you are going to go into the role of religion next week. My question is: Is it possible that Science might take over the traditional role of Religion in keeping the 'fibre' with which to build the next societies? An example of this might be the Svalbard International Seed Vault completed this year. It looks like, short of a direct hit by a large celestial object, that seed bank will be a keepsake of our current agricultural knowledge for many, many years to come.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Jason<br><br><a href=why-decline-matters.html#c5825209415387818095 title="comment permalink">5/29/08, 8:49 AM</a><br><br>

Of course, you'd lose the alliteration, but you'd also lose the connotation of the kind of sudden catastrophic event that you've been working so hard to distinguish your concepts from.<br><br>I'd like to offer a different, complementary view on culture conservation: the essence of this is working backward from an imagined future in which another decline (or even collapse) is occurring. This would be a decline which would have been easily preventable if the people involved had known of some things, or some ways of seeing or working, that are readily available today. What might these things/ways be? In other words, out of all the current knowledge, wisdom, practices, cultures, etc., which might be most useful to preserve in order to help our descendants avoid Santayana's Syndrome (failing to learn from history, and thus being doomed to repeat it)?<br><br>Clearly, this view has as many issues and problems as the "forward-looking" view, but it does have the virtue of focusing the search toward what might be crucial tools in avoiding or mitigating collapses or declines.<br><br>In the same vein, here's a comment on Tom's quote from Fred Hoyle: "in a process that ultimately encourages the survival of the more civic-minded, intelligent, and pacifist strains in the Homo sapiens gene pool." I'd say that this process would be highly desirable, but also highly contingent. I'm not aware of any historical declines that favored such strains; I'd very much like to be enlightened by the more historically aware. In any case, this might be a way to sharpen the "future perfect thinking" approach above: focus on conserving and enhancing the "civic-minded, intelligent, and pacifist" cultural elements of the present.<br><br><a href=why-decline-matters.html#c7939362012728956146 title="comment permalink">5/29/08, 9:49 AM</a><br><br>

The Archdruid seems perfectly correct on this issue. <br><br>The only point I might raise is that the reports of our civilization's death may have been exaggerated. It is quite possible that advancing technology and some changes in social behavior may cause global energy prices to stabilize at a higher, but not unmanageable level for a very long period of time, and that cultural shifts driven by climate change or pollution may cause mass death (a frequent sad occurrence over the long sweep of history), but as you say, not enough to actually bring down civilization. As for culture, human societies are sadly always losing and forgetting or destroying huge tranches of their cultural backstory, but these losses do not necessarily cripple our ability to go forward. The 16th-17th centuries were a time of mass forgetting in England, as monastic and manorial libraries were closed and bought by speculators for waste paper, and also a time of vast environmental destruction as medieval forests were cut for ship building. Both of these circumstances were lamented by intellectuals of that time as signs of coming barbarity, but neither stopped the growth of the British Empire.<br><br>The only other point I might make in relation to religion, is that it seems to me the emotional energy required for successful cultural conservation must also have a potent pragmatic component. By 600 AD the Christian churches had largely taken over the functions of the Roman civil administration in much of Europe: they saved all that Roman law and philosophy because they needed it for the very pragmatic exigencies of government. It's no accident that we have a large number of Cicero's letters but that Petronius's "Satyricon" survived only in a tiny fragment by chance. Most of what we like to call our artistic heritage--including the movies seen by the unwashed public as well as the incomprehensible art of the elites--are unlikely to survive, just as Greek painting and Roman music do not survive--not because they are impossible to maintain but because they just don't serve to keep people in order. <br><br>It seems to me that those of us who amuse ourselves thinking about very long term cultural conservation ought to take a very unsentimental look at what we are investing our time and energy into saving, and consider its practical value--lest we end up as the guy in S. Fowler Wright's "The Deluge" (a 1930s catastrophe novel) who survived the destruction of society in a house packed with light novels and symbolist drawings that perished the moment he lost the power to preserve it.<br><br>All the best, <br><br>S<br><br><a href=why-decline-matters.html#c5947796801513670910 title="comment permalink">5/29/08, 11:50 AM</a><br><br>

As it continues to grow, AODA will be encouraging its local groups to set up lending libraries for their members and friends, for very much the reasons you've outlined. <br><br>Suzanne, I understand your concern but I think you're missing the implications of the process of catabolic collapse. A fast collapse with mass dieoff can be followed by an equally fast recovery -- including a recovery of human populations, as people breed to capacity. A punctuated decline of the sort I'm predicting will see the same sort of demographic collapse we're seeing in the former Soviet Union, where the population is expected to drop by half before 2100. The reasons are the same: economic contraction, collapsing public health, death rates outpacing birth rates for a wide range of reasons. I expect to see that pattern spreading over much of the world in the next decade or so. <br><br>At the same time, there's quite a bit that people can do to soften their impact on the biosphere and establish refugia from which threatened ecosystems can recolonize damaged areas. That's a topic dear to the hearts of many Druids, and will be the subject of several posts not too far in the future. Stay tuned!<br><br>Millbrook, I stand corrected. I'd picked up the idea somewhere that Herod the Great's complete rebuilding of the Second Temple counted as the Third. <br><br>Robert, beautiful.<br><br>Jason, you're using a crystal ball, I see.

It's a lesson we've been doing our best not to learn, but you know, I think we'll have our noses rubbed in it shortly. <br><br>Shark, well, we'll see. My take is that there's a significant difference between the cultural rhetoric of decline we saw in the 1600s and the historical and ecological analyses that put teeth into current predictions of major trouble ahead for industrial civilization -- and nobody's yet made a convincing case that other sources of energy can replace fossil fuels as we use them up. <br><br>Robin, that's a Druid perspective (among other things) -- the survival of the biosphere is more important than the survival of any individual species, ours very much included. <br><br>Dwig, that's a fascinating idea, one I'll have to consider at more length before responding.<br><br><a href=why-decline-matters.html#c7566898543133676762 title="comment permalink">5/29/08, 1:38 PM</a><br><br>

One of those "seems so obvious once someone points it out" moments. Fast crashes are easier for cultures to handle than slow declines. Again, wow.<br><br>Like you, JMG, I tend to shake my head at some of the survivalist fantasy scenarios. Some of them — especially the "marauding hordes" scenario — are based on contradictory facts. How can anyone expect that people, who haven't walked farther than building-to-car in years, will be able to hike out to someone's armed compound and take their stuff? A simple lack of knowledge about proper <b>footwear</b> (let alone backpacking, camping, water purification, foraging, or combat) will keep those "hordes" close to home. Chicago to North Dakota? Like you said, it won't happen. Even Chicago to Rockford is unlikely, IMO.<br><br>Sure, sheer numbers will guarantee a few will get more than 20 miles, but I doubt there will be more than a few. Urban gangs may look scary, and actually <i>be</i> scary on their home turf, but I doubt their "away game" would get them far either. Those marauders of the plague years were almost certainly used to walking everywhere and getting by on near-constant short rations, probably knew every edible wild plant, and didn't have to contend with polluted streams.<br><br>Disaster preparation is simply the smart thing to do. But like anything else, it can be taken too far. Even if the lurid fantasies came to pass, and those with beans and blasters were the only ones left afterwards, what then? "Rebuild society," I've heard some say, but with what? and in what image?<br><br>It might be useful to divide knowledge/information into categories: things we need to know to survive during the crisis years (farming, renewable energy production, herbal &amp; other medicine, recycling scrap metal, weather forecasting); things that might be useful to our descendants (machining, manufacturing, other forms of light industry, mechanical calculators such as the abacus &amp; slide rule); things that could be enlightening but could be replaced (art, music, literature, history, computer technology). More effort will be needed to preserve the later categories, simply because they are convenience items or outright luxuries, probably considered expendable during a crisis. I'm not sure it's our job to preserve our civilization; our descendants will create one that suits them.<br><br><a href=why-decline-matters.html#c698280305256606279 title="comment permalink">5/29/08, 2:20 PM</a><br><br>

Well, let's start with crops grown using the seeds survivalists are so sedulously stockpiling right now, plus widely available wild foods, plus all the livestock and crops from all the farms too far from big cities for those imaginary marauding hordes to get to them -- and I could go on for some time. Even in an extreme subsistence crisis there's food to be had, for at least some survivors."<br><br>Seeds that the survivalists are saving: First, for that to be of any significance, all of the people that are saving seeds would have to be among the survivors. That's not likely. Second, saving heirloom seeds is only a small part of the food growing puzzle. One must have the fertile ground to raise the crops, the water to quench the veggie's thirst, the know-how to eke from Mother Nature and her other favorite critters who dine at the human's garden an adequate harvest, and the additional know-how to cultivate, harvest, prepare, and save seed from year to year. These are skills that only a sad few possess. Thirdly, why would you assume that those outrageous, extreme survivalists would even consider sharing their precious seeds with anyone else, most of whom the survivalists ardently disdain and deplore? Lastly, the abstract logical leap from survivalists saving seeds to an adequately fed post-apocalyptic rural American populace is an extreme of cornucopian optimism. Don't look to the survivalist's seeds to save anyone.<br><br>Wild foods: Honed, skilled, bred, and born of subsistence necessity, Native American peoples were tested without mercy to survive on wild foods, both plant and animal. Who in their correct senses could imagine that 21st century [mostly] European descendants could even begin to garner adequate sustenance from wild foods.<br><br>Livestock and crops from all the farms: This is your scenario - "five horrific years later" there will be no livestock and crops on those farms. Yes, the hordes will get out to most of those farms in rather short order and decimate all that is there. The farms that are actually too far out are too far out for a reason - the conditions are harsh and without oil-derived energy they will sustain little to no livestock and crops. The survivors will have to settle right where humans have previously settled, where the Native Americans settled and where the European hordes invaded, basically in the fertile valleys. All those remote farms are an industrial age anomaly.<br><br>As one who collects heirloom seeds and has practiced seed-saving [that is, the grow-your-own variety], I have pondered this question virtually incessantly over the last eight years. I have been unable to find the answer. Growing all of one’s food will be impossible for virtually all survivors. Wild game will be soon decimated. Wild plants are illusive at best. Staying fed will be singularly the most important and consuming part of life for the survivors. Success will be meager, sporadic, and inconsistent. Inadequate nourishment will be the rule. It will take at least an entire generation before most North American humans learn how to feed themselves. <br><br>This is not an issue that can be superficially brushed aside or inattentively dismissed. A fast collapse will leave little opportunity for anything but searching for one's next meal.<br><br>or so it seems to...<br><br>Micheal<br><br><a href=why-decline-matters.html#c6524099709533826254 title="comment permalink">5/29/08, 10:19 PM</a><br><br>

It's not meant to; as I've suggested before, it's a religious belief with a thin layer of secular frosting on it. As for classifying knowledge, yes -- though I'd hate to see everyone making the same classification. Diversity is as important in knowledge as it is in ecology. <br><br>Mechanic, I'm delighted to see anybody calling on the memory of Pythagoras these days! Thanks for the link. <br><br>Highwindows, I'll check it out. <br><br>Yooper, I look forward to it. <br><br>Stephen, I think there's every hope that a larger body of knowledge can make it through the approaching dark age than survived previous examples of the species. Printing makes a difference; if enough people get to work on the older, sustainable printing technologies, hand-operated presses may keep working right through the dark age, which could make knowledge considerably more accessible and less likely to get lost.

Simply that by stacking one worst case scenarios on top of another, and one extreme assumption on top of another, it's possible to imagine a future that will fit just about any Hollywood fantasy you care to name.

Suvivor? I'm almost 50 now, and I can assure you it's been a long hard road to endure. Decline? I knew this at the beginning, when starting out.

Perhaps now is as good as time as any to talk about this, when gasoline has doubled in price the last couple of years.<br><br>The size of our global society was created by cheap energy or fuel.

I'm quite sure that the Roman and Mayan societies experienced similar dynamics, what very little I've been told about them.<br><br>In the past 50 or so years our global society has doubled in size, within two generations. It only stands to reason that if we cannot find another fuel to power our society, then the very best scenario we can expect in the next 50 years of descent is a 50% decline in population. That is almost a mathematical certainy. Correct me if I'm wrong, did you not allude to this in "Adam's Story"?<br><br>If I remember correctly, you did not go into detail "how"(in pectanges in time) the population was halved BY THAT TIME. "Catabolic collapse" defines steps (which can be quite drastic) down, to be followed by periods of "recovery", to be followed by more decline, more recovery (incline), more decline(downward bend), more partcial recovery, to lead to a possible large step down(collapse; a sudden caving in), to be followed by a time of recovery and on and on and on........<br><br>Ok, following this train of thought, within that 50 year span of events to Adam's day, the population could have been halved long ago before his time and stayed consistant for decades to his day. OR (lets be drastic here, since I'm telling the story?), the population was reduced to 5% of what it once was and through migration of peoples from other lands the population grew to half what it once was, 50 years before?<br><br>Inclines and declines, collapses all happening simultaneously worldwide, can only be viewed when taken into awhole as "descent". Quite likely, "decline" and this process may last centuries, perhaps thousands or millions of years? "Modern man" will long ago have become extinct and could have evolved into an entire different being? <br><br>Thanks, yooper<br><br><a href=why-decline-matters.html#c8555873722354855921 title="comment permalink">5/30/08, 3:18 PM</a><br><br>

This, unless I'm very much mistaken, is a fairly new idea (and it's likely to become an obsolete idea in a not too distant future). You hear people today say that it's not 'natural' for a child to die before his/her parents do; had you suggested something of the sort to people who'd lived their whole lives in a society with even a moderate infant mortality rate, they'd likely look at you as if you'd grown a second head. <br><br>I'm not saying that the human cost of all of this is negligible, of course not. I am saying that if we march into the future armed with the idea that having at least 70 years to live is our birthright, this is going to be even more painful than it needs to be (and it's going to be painful whichever way you cut it). If we perceive something as 'natural' (in this case, dying at any age), that won't make it painless for us, but it will make it tolerable. If we perceive it as 'unnatural' or as 'unjust' or as 'something that just isn't supposed to happen', than we run the risk of being driven out of our minds by our sorrow. This is because, in the first case, we see the pain caused by our misfortune (the death of a child, say) as something that one is supposed to get through, and being social beings and culture-bearers, we do our best to live up to our culture's expectations; and in the second case, we see the pain that one feels at the death of a child as something that's supposed to devastate a good parent, and leave him/her badly scarred for the rest of his/her life, and of course we act accordingly. <br><br>(By the way, for the history of Western ideas about death, I suggest Philippe Aries's work; he wrote in French, but I know that he's been translated into English.)<br><br><a href=why-decline-matters.html#c2775667503366504164 title="comment permalink">5/31/08, 7:53 AM</a><br><br>

Yes, death is natural. It is how nature made way for evolution through sex. If the old fogies didn't die, there would never be room for 'new' (old) ideas. The idea that death is natural happens to be old, but 'new' in a death-denying, adolescent, we-can-live-forever culture. One of my students declared, "We have a duty to die." In other words, stop fighting it and learn to do it gracefully and with dignity, as people in many other, older cultures do. And savor and cherish life until it's time to go. As individuals we can learn this, even if it is too late for our civilization to learn to let go.<br><br>When you have names and forms, know that they are provisional.

As for our ability to learn the lesson of living in harmony with nature, remember that we're coming right out of a 25-year period when energy was cheaper and more abundant than it has ever been in human history -- or will ever be again. Our culture is still burdened with the extreme distortions of perspective that caused. We're an adaptable species, and as the last extravagant blowoff of the Oil Age fades into memory, I suspect you'll see people and cultures adapt a good deal more readily than you may think. <br><br>Isis and Suzanne (again), one of the books that influenced me most was Theodore Roszak's <i>Where the Wasteland Ends</i>. He commented that death, rather than sex, was the great unspeakable obscenity in modern industrial culture: "We will all, every man, woman, and child of us, know fifty-seven clever ways to [copulate] before we know one humanly becoming way to die." That's an attitude that has to change. <br><br>Back a couple of decades ago, I spent some years working as a caregiver in nursing homes, and got to know the guy with the scythe fairly well; you can't hide from the reality of death very long when your job involves tending the dying and cleaning up bodies before the undertaker hauls them off. It was a useful education in the realities of existence, and one that, in one way or another, I suspect many of us will get in the decades to come.<br><br><a href=why-decline-matters.html#c1840262783573562293 title="comment permalink">5/31/08, 12:54 PM</a><br><br>

We do this as best we can, and there are many strategies, cultural or personal. Leaving out morality as well, unfortunately. <br><br>I assume we all know it is almost certain for all of us that at least one of our ancestors somewhere in the mists of time was born from less than desirable circumstances, through unjust or evil circumstances forced upon our ancient mothers (rape, enslavement, incest, deception, war etc.) We are all the children of some tragedy if you go back far enough.<br><br>Now, just as we have certain things we have to live through, and our children must live through, there are other consequences to expect. There are going to be a lot of unpopular or downright offensive things involved in reproduction and raising children if there is a decline/collapse.<br><br>We have a sense of entitlement that we are all expected or have a right to have children. But some of us just don't cut it biologically; some don't have children because of physical inability, but lots also do not because of cultural or psychosocial factors.<br><br> And lots of children are born presently who will not only survive because of medical or other problems, though their parents will do all they can, but many children are born with behavioral or antisocial problems that will make things even nastier for society as they get older (lots of parents would rather be their children's "buddies" than parents).<br><br>When human brains began to get bigger millions of years ago, through natural selection, women's hips began to grow to accommodate their babies' heads (and also the human skull began to be more malleable at birth, the sutures acting as hinges and also the presence of the fontanelle). <br><br>Through genetic variability and natural selection, women had anatomical variability and some died in childbirth due to problems with anatomy and the birth canal. In general, such deaths in childbirth happened fairly frequently, even to the last century.<br><br>Caesarean births are the most common and preferable in hospitals these days, due to insurance and liability, especially for succeeding births. It is often imposed on women by their physicians, as a matter of procedure and hospital policy. That means women who are incapable of having children naturally, survive and have even more. That means even more girl children who are unsuited to have children naturally (narrow hips or other anatomical issues) will survive to have children of their own in the future, etc.<br><br>As long as our medical system survives, fine, although it is frightening to think at some point without some check, human beings might eventually not be able to be born naturally. <br><br>At some point in any possible decline or collapse, when medical care becomes difficult to get, caesarean births will become rare or impossible to perform. And then, many, many otherwise healthy women will die in childbirth during decline/collapse, because of their ancestors that survived and passed on their genes for small hips, etc. etc.<br><br>How do all the chemicals in the environment affect our reproduction process? How do all the various types of microwaves, cellphones, wireless interent etc., affect our reproduction... like honeybees we are part of nature.<br><br>It is also certain that there will be pressures to change climate (contrails anyone?) or create underground/enclosed cities to counter global climate change. How will this affect fertility? <br><br>But it seems the endpoint of the choices we are making indicates the ultimate goal is for everyone to be genetically engineered, have designer-babies, live in some sort of "Matrix"-honeycomb, microchipped virtual/second-life eating some form of soylent green. Is that really the choice that we have?

Everyone who is worried about peak oil seems to assume that the crisis will cause collapse in every country in the world at the same time.<br><br>This is not realistic, Take France: France gets 79% of its power from nuclear energy and another 13% from hydroelectric. So in the case of a peak oil catastrophe, France would be able to keep the lights on and a lot of wheels turning over while it was opening old coal mines, building windmills, etc. Similarly, Norway get 99% of its electric power from hydroelectric. Countries like Venezuela, Iran and Bahrein have oil surpluses. Does anyone seriously think the govermnents of these countries would allow export if the result would be social collapse?<br><br>There's a further point: just as some countries are pretty well protected against peak oil, some countries are highly vulnerable. China comes to mind. If such countries collapse, they will no longer import oil. That will reduce worldwide demand for oil, which in turn will reduce the price of oil.

We'll get into some of the reasons in future posts. <br><br>Dan, no argument there. It's worth noting that despite (or because of) the high rate of medical intervention in birth and early childhood, the US has a rate of childhood mortality right now lower than any other industrial nation, and roughly equal to that of Indonesia. <br><br>Jack, there's no flaw in your reasoning. This is something I've been suggesting for years -- the decline of industrial society will be a complex phenomenon, with sharp variations over space and time. In particular, I suspect that Europe will play Byzantium to America's Rome -- but we'll see. <br><br>Farfetched, good point. Given the knowledge base, a great many things can be done in ways much simpler than they're being done now. More on this later. <br><br>Arachne, you're quite right that mobility doesn't require high tech -- the Mongols were very mobile, and so were my Lakota ancestors. Still, I think you're underestimating the challenge of preserving more than a small portion of today's knowledge base in the absence of current data storage technology -- and most of this will be going away soon as the energy costs mount up. <br><br>Anthony, I'll take your word for it -- my internet connection is too slow for YouTube. <br><br>Dwig, I think it's an excellent idea. <br><br>Teresa, good. Wait and see!<br><br>Beli, welcome to the new reality. It's been interesting to watch people begin wake up and realize that the world has changed and yesterday's rules don't work any more. As that awareness spreads, things may get weird. <br><br>Off to work on today's post...<br><br><a href=why-decline-matters.html#c980533341605539639 title="comment permalink">6/4/08, 9:42 AM</a><br><br>
