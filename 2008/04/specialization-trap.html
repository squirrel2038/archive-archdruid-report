Few ideas are quite as unpopular nowadays as the suggestion that the fate of past civilizations has something to teach us about the likely destiny of our own. This lack of enthusiasm for the lessons of history pervades contemporary culture; what makes this interesting is that it is also among the most fruitful sources of disaster in the modern world. The ongoing implosion of real estate prices around the industrial world is simply one example out of many. <br><br>Long before the phrase “condo flipper” entered common usage, one thing should have been obvious: anybody who claims that an asset class can keep on increasing in value forever is shoveling smoke. From the 17th century Dutch tulip mania to the internet bubble of the late 1990s, financial history is littered with the blackened ruins of speculative booms that crashed and burned while in hot pursuit of the fantasy of endless appreciation. None of this kept investors in the last few years from betting the future on the belief that this time was different, and real estate prices would keep rising forever – or from lambasting those few spoilsports who suggested that what went up would inevitably, in due time, come down.<br><br>Those of us who insist on reading today’s headlines about peak oil in the light of history risk a similar reaction. Still, it’s a risk worth taking. The logic that insists that while all other civilizations have risen and fallen, ours will just keep rising forever, differs not a whit from the logic underlying the late real estate bubble; the only difference is one of scale. It’s for this reason among others that I try to keep up with scholarship on the decline and fall of past civilizations, and that was what brought me to Bryan Ward-Perkins’ valuable book <span style="font-style: italic">The Fall of Rome and the End of Civilization</span> (Oxford UP, 2005).<br><br>Those of my readers who don’t keep track of current fashions in historiography may not know that for several decades now, such phrases as “the Dark Ages” and “the fall of Rome” have been <span style="font-style: italic">nomina non grata</span> in scholarly circles. The transition that turned western Europe from the crowded, cosmopolitan Roman world into the depopulated, impoverished patchwork of barbarian chiefdoms that succeeded it has been recast by several influential writers as a process of positive cultural evolution that just happened to feature such awkward incidents as, say, the sack of Rome by the Visigoths.<br><br>Now it’s only fair to say that, like most revisionist histories, this one made a necessary point. An older generation of historians had gone so far in the other direction – demonizing the barbarians, ignoring the real cultural achievements of the centuries following Rome’s fall, and paying too little attention to the survival of the eastern Roman Empire during the years when its western twin imploded – that a reaction was overdue. Like most revisionist histories, however, the reaction pushed itself to the point of absurdity, and Ward-Perkins’ book is a useful corrective.<br><br>One of the tools he uses to document the real scale and impact of the western empire’s collapse is the humble but eloquent voice of pottery. The Roman pottery industry was huge, capable, and highly centralized, churning out fine tableware, storage vessels, roof tiles, and many other goods in such vast quantities that archeologists across Roman Europe struggle to cope with the fragments today. The pottery works at La Graufesenque in what is now southern France and was then the province of Gallia Narbonense, for instance, shipped exquisite products throughout the western empire, and beyond it – goods bearing the La Graufesenque stamp have been found in Denmark and eastern Germany. Good pottery was so cheap and widely available that even rural farm families could afford elegant tableware, sturdy cooking pots, and watertight roof tiles.<br><br>Rome’s fall changed all this. When archeologists uncovered the grave of a sixth-century Saxon king at Sutton Hoo in eastern Britain, for example, the pottery found among the grave goods told an astonishing tale of technical collapse. Had it been made in fourth century Britain, the Sutton Hoo pottery would have been unusually crude for a peasant farmhouse; two centuries later, it sat on the table of a king. What’s more, much of it had to be imported, because so simple a tool as a potter’s wheel dropped entirely out of use in post-Roman Britain, as part of a cascading collapse that took Britain down to levels of economic and social complexity not seen there since the subsistence crises of the middle Bronze Age more than a thousand years before.<br><br>Ward-Perkins’ book contains many other illustrations of the human cost of the Roman collapse – the demographic traces of massive depopulation, the way that trends in graffiti track the end of widespread literacy, the decline in the size of post-Roman cattle as a marker of agricultural contraction, and much more – but I want to focus on the pottery here, because it tells a tale with more than a little relevance to our own time. Cooking vessels, food containers, and roofing that keeps the rain out, after all, are basic to any form of settled life. An agricultural society that cannot produce them is impoverished by any definition; an agricultural society that had the ability to produce them, and loses it, has clearly undergone an appalling decline.<br><br>What happened to put such obviously useful items out of the reach of the survivors of Rome’s collapse? As Ward-Perkins shows, the post-Roman economic collapse had its roots in the very sophistication and specialization that made the Roman economy so efficient. Pottery, again, makes an excellent example of the wider process. Huge pottery factories like the one at La Graufesenque, which used specialist labor to turn out quality goods in immense volume, could make a profit only by marketing their wares on a nearly continental scale, using sophisticated networks of transport and exchange to reach consumers all over the western empire who wanted pottery and had denarii to spend on it. The Roman world was rich, complex, and stable enough to support such networks – but the post-Roman world was not.<br><br>The implosion of the western empire thus turned what had been a massive economic advantage into a fatal vulnerability. As the networks of transport and exchange came apart, the Roman economy went down with it, and that economy had relied on centralized production and specialized labor for so long that there was nothing in place to take up the slack. During the Roman Empire’s heyday, people in the towns and villas near Sutton Hoo could buy their pottery from local merchants, who shipped them in from southern Britain, Gaul, and points further off. They didn’t need local pottery factories, and so didn’t have them, and that meant their descendants very nearly ended up with no pottery at all.<br><br>Even where Roman pottery factories existed, they were geared toward mass production of specialized types, not to small-scale manufacture of the whole range of pottery products needed by local communities. Worse, as population levels declined and the economy contracted, the pottery on hand would have been more than adequate for immediate needs, removing any market for new production. A single generation of social chaos and demographic contraction thus could easily have been enough to break the transmission of the complex craft traditions of Roman pottery-making, leaving the survivors with only the dimmest idea of how to make good pottery.<br><br>Trace any other economic specialty through the trajectory of the post-Roman world and the same pattern appears. Economic specialization and centralized production, the core strategies of Roman economic success, left Rome’s successor states with few choices and fewer resources in a world where local needs had to be met by local production. Caught in the trap of their own specialization, most parts of the western empire came out the other end of the process of decline far more impoverished and fragmented than they had been before the centralized Roman economy evolved in the first place.<br><br>Map this same process onto the most likely future of industrial society, in turn, and the parallels have daunting implications. In modern industrial nations, the production and distribution of goods are far more centralized than anything Rome ever achieved. Nearly all workers at every level of the economy perform highly specialized niche jobs, most of which only function within the structure of a highly centralized, mechanized, and energy-intensive global economy, and many of which have no meaning or value at all outside that structure. If the structure falters, access to even the most basic goods and services could become a challenge very quickly.<br><br>Food is the obvious example – a very small number of people in any industrial nation have the skills necessary to grow their own food, and even fewer could count on access to the land, tools, and seed stock to give it a try – but the same principle holds for every other necessity of life, not to mention countless other things that would be good to have in the deindustrial dark age that looms up ahead of us in most of our possible futures. Consider the suite of skills needed, for example, to locate and process suitable fibers, spin and weave them into cloth, and make the cloth into clothing. Not many people these days have any of those skills, much less all of them; the tools needed to do most of them are not exactly household items in most homes these days, and the ability to build and repair those tools are even more specialized.<br><br>Our situation is thus far more precarious than Rome’s was. On the other hand, we have an advantage that the Roman world apparently lacked – if we choose to use it. The possibility of a future dark age apparently never entered the cultural dialogue in Roman times, but it has been raised repeatedly in ours. Preventive action – the deliberate revival of nonindustrial ways of providing necessary goods and services – is well within the reach of individuals and local communities, and indeed some of this work has already been done by hobbyists and people involved in historical reenactment societies of various kinds.<br><br>A great deal more of the same thing will be needed, though, to keep the decline of industrial society from leaving the same sort of economic vacuum in its wake that Rome’s fall left behind. I am coming to think that one of the most useful things anyone concerned about the future can do is to adopt some practical craft that produces goods or services useful in a deindustrializing world, and get skilled at it. If we are to get much of anything out from between the jaws of the specialization trap, projects such as this are a crucial step.

As you know, I've spent a great deal of my life trying to learn many of these skills (and doing not most of them very well). One benefit of having the persistent sense that my civilization was on the verge of collapse is that I know that my wife and I can feed, clothe and house our family if my insanely abstract and specialized job goes away.<br><br><a href=#c447288766473427081 title="comment permalink">4/15/08, 11:33 PM</a><br><br>

I imagine many saw it coming and watched it roll on by feeling just as helpless as we all do today. It undoubtedly takes a critical mass of acceptance within a society to effectively counter a perceived future problem and I doubt if an empire in full bloom could muster anywhere near that critical mass in time to do any good.<br><br><a href=#c31167671509473832 title="comment permalink">4/15/08, 11:56 PM</a><br><br>

She also told me that the Romanovs were descendants of the Caesars (note "Roman"ov, and that "czar" is a Russified form of "caesar"). Interesting way of looking at things — but like you said, you pretty much have to ignore things like the collapse of centralized industry and the enormous human costs to see it as anything but a disaster.<br><br>In "doomer" circles, there's a tendency to consider interdependencies as a weakness… and naturally idealizing the "rugged individualist." Many of them point to centralized industries and fuel-dependent transportation networks as supporting evidence, forgetting that centralization is a mostly recent development. Prominent Y2K doomers such as Gary North and Kurt Saxon continually harped on the "division of labor" as the Achilles' Heel that would Doom Us All.<br><br>As energy becomes more constricted over time, there's nothing to prevent industry from decentralizing — except for human stubbornness, which I admit can be very powerful — and continuing to thrive, as long as there's a local market for the goods. I agree that overspecialization is a problem, but at the same time you can't have a working civilization without *some* division of labor (i.e. specialization). The trick will be to prevent the re-emergence of a parasitic ruling class that simply sits back &amp; tells everyone else what to do.<br><br><a href=#c1774614893223529685 title="comment permalink">4/16/08, 6:50 AM</a><br><br>

For example, pottery made by local craftspersons is certainly going to be more expensive than what you can get at Sprawl-Mart. It is money well spent, though, for it will help strengthen the diversity of your local network of suppliers, and assure that locally made pottery IS available when you need it. <br><br>One cannot possibly become skilled enough to do everything well, or even just good enough. Nor does one have enough time, or enough money to buy all the different equipment, nor do many of us even have enough space (pottery studios and kilns do require some space), to make it feasible to try to take on everything. Thus, it is not that the idea of specialization is necessarilly bad; on the contrary, it is and will still be necessary. It is only taking it to such extreme levels, and especially the centralization that accompanies it, that is the real problem.<br><br>Being willing to pay a premium for local crafts implies a general re-prioritization of one's entire household expenditure pattern. Instead of accumulating a large household full of junk made by global corporations and sold in chain stores at cheap prices, what need to transition to smaller houses, sparsely furnished with a few cherished items that have been made by and acquired by local craftspersons (probably known personally to the owner), or made by the owner him/herself. It seems that Thoreau, the Shakers, and other proponents of what might be called "simple living" had some things to say in favor of this.<br><br><a href=#c7617648189237134198 title="comment permalink">4/16/08, 8:28 AM</a><br><br>

While I can't do a good number of the things he lists--or, for that matter, in the Foxfire books--it's amazing what one can learn to do when one must. Though I'm a writer and editor by trade, I've just put my first garden in this year, and we're talking with our downstairs neighbors about trying to convince the leasing agency to let us have a trio of Bantam hens in the back yard.<br><br>It's going to be interesting seeing where the next few decades take us; I'll be thirty this November, so with luck I'll have four to five more decades 'round the mortal coil. Part of me looks forward with trepidation, because there's no way the lifestyle I grew up with can be maintained. However, there's also hope, persistent hope, that enough people will wake up before it's too late. Considering the Romans didn't have nukes, and (as far as we know) hadn't managed to kill off large portions of ocean flora, I think in some ways their situation wasn't as dire (though certainly still shocking to them). The stakes are a lot higher now, and I hate to think of what could happen in the case of a figurative--or literal--meltdown. Still, it's no reason NOT to try to improve things while we still can.<br><br><a href=#c8025357195880414080 title="comment permalink">4/16/08, 9:58 AM</a><br><br>

The question is whether you can have all the economic specialties needed for everyday life within a day's walk of where you live. We don't now, and in the not too distant future, we may need to. <br><br>Observer, an excellent point -- and we'll be talking about the Shakers down the road a bit, too. <br><br>Lupa, good for you -- a garden and a henhouse is an excellent start. <br><br>Ruben, I've discussed climate change here several times, but it's been a while. Doomsday scenarios of global warming miss two crucial points. First, the worst case scenarios assume we've got unlimited oil and coal to burn, and we don't -- peak oil and depletion of coal reserves will cut short our production of CO2 long before we get to the levels they're assuming. <br><br>Second, the earth has been here before, many times. Around 9500 BCE, global temperature spiked between 13 and 15 degrees F. in less than a decade -- a change far more drastic than anything global warming scientists predict. Some species died out, a lot of coastal real estate got flooded as ice sheets melted, and some of our ancestors had a rough time of it, but it wasn't the end of the world. <br><br>Extreme climate change is a very common feature in the earth's long history; it's basically business as usual for the biosphere. We're in for a good strong bout of it, and I don't advise living too close to sea level, but there will still be plenty of call for survival skills in its aftermath.<br><br><a href=#c1124183415658684889 title="comment permalink">4/16/08, 10:59 AM</a><br><br>

I like the way you used it as a metaphor for cultural decline. Pottery making is definitely one of the nearly universal methods for making tools, and making and using tools is one of the main attributes of human civilization. If we lose that ability, we lose an awful lot. Coming right after what one has managed to store in their head, tools and the skills to use them are where it's at, survival-wise. <br><br>I'm planning to take some courses on pottery here this summer and fall. I've dabbled in wheel thrown pottery before, but I need to brush up and extend my skills. I want to learn to make the usual plates, bowls, cups, etc - but also things like small to medium size Harsch-style pickling crocks for fermenting cabbage and cucumbers and what not. Besides the fact that I have been salivating over a really good sauerkraut crock for a while (they are horrendously expensive, even for small ones) I think knowing how to use a kick wheel to throw that sort of thing later might be a very valuable skill to have in a contracted and somewhat isolated local economy. Believe it or not, while I have seen a handful of local potters selling their wares, I have never seen anyone here locally producing things like pickling crocks. I guess there hasn't been too much market for it up to this point. <br><br>Danby, I hear you - my job is also insanely specialized (web application programming.) Needless to say, that likely won't last past the very early stages of electrical grid collapse. But I have lots of other knowledge, tools and skills for making a living that I've been accumulating throughout my life. I'm definitely not planning to go empty-handed or empty-headed into whatever lies ahead of us. <br><br>Lupa: "As I was reading this, I couldn't help but think of Heinlein's "Specialization is for insects" ramble." <br><br>Me, too! And as a funny note on synchronicity, we were discussing exactly that quote yesterday afternoon in one of my classes. But I agree, he was right on that. Just like animals are more prone to extinction when highly specialized, I think so are people. <br><br>One thing we have going for us that the post Roman world for the most part *didn't* have - we have billions of books to help us remember how to do the things we've forgotten how to do. A book is not as good as solid hands-on experience, but it's sure a lot better than nothing!<br><br><a href=#c4710192125365267204 title="comment permalink">4/16/08, 1:21 PM</a><br><br>

Everything is far too specialized. Everything has to go back to the factory for repairs. What happens when it's just as abhorrently cost prohibitive to send it back to the factory for repair as it is to purchase an item? What happens to the factory laborer trained to do nothing but install selector button #12, when no one can afford to buy or repair the item that uses selector button #12 anymore? Here's to the hopeful rebirth of the Appliance Repair shops and the resurgence of the local Handyman.<br><br><a href=#c6308622679133176580 title="comment permalink">4/16/08, 2:10 PM</a><br><br>

Besides building terra-preta soil and growing food -- and low-tech, self-foraging small livestock -- in permaculture/Fukuoka-do-nothing-farming patterns, to pick a few other examples at random, I'm making scythes, forestry bills and similar tools, and learning their use. Also I'm planning this year to expand my lo-tech food-preserving work (sun/air-drying, pickling) for a complete range of vegetables, fruits and meat. And I still hope to get started this year on a miniplot of self-fertile, no-till grain growing, following Marc Bonfils work, if time and energy can be found!<br><br>The animating drive behind all this is the sense that our current hyper-complex society is on the very edge of its death-cliff, and if I live long enough, I shall see it commence what those of us awake to what's happening will have no doubt is its slo-mo plunge towards disintegration. In fact, the toppling over the edge is happening right now, I surmise.<br><br>Not much point in talking about this, though, to people who are still -- consciously, at least -- outside the small coterie of the awake. The Kassandra-verbot still operates. After a few attempts to explain to friends and family what I'm doing and why, and watching them glaze-over into cognitive dissonance, I realised that I should just keep shtum, and wait.

You must keep in mind the single greatest revolutionary invention of the Second Millennium: the printing press. Forget all the information stored on the Internet; that will fade away with distressing speed over the decades if electricity and communication infrastructure become localized and unreliable. But we have books. Enormous numbers of them. All over the world, not just in Irish Monasteries like last time. All this knowledge is preserved in written, printed form. And even though the books are not immortal either, enough of them should survive the centuries to help preserve and re-invent empire-free production and sustenance. This certainly won't prevent the scenario JMG describes, but it should help ease the changeover.<br><br>As for doomsday climate change scenarios, they all require some type of positive feedback loop in the global climate system that will cause some effect or another to be self-amplifying until we look like either Venus or Mars. If Earth's global climate system was prone to positive feedbacks, though, it would have broken down and run to one of these extremes millions or billions of years ago, and there'd be no climatologists here now to ponder it. So I trust that in the long-term and the large-scale, the Earth's natural climate regulatory processes are dominated by strong negative feedbacks that keep it within a broad biologically-friendly range. Hence, whatever the anthropogenic effects from the fossil fuel boom are, in the long-term (centuries-millennia) they will be dampened and swallowed within the natural stabilizing processes. The world may look very different, but it won't be dead.<br><br><a href=#c8442520309603705785 title="comment permalink">4/17/08, 6:11 AM</a><br><br>

Kindleberger &amp; Robert Aliber. He shows several examples of the four stages of asset inflation leading to crashes. Most asset inflation bubbles are caused by easy credit. Asset appreciation is greater than the cost of credit so investment in the asset is easy.<br><br>First stage is mania where everyone is talking about the asset appreciation in glowing terms. You have to get into bubble.com, I made 25% last week!!! My house made me $100,000 last year!!!!! You can buy on margin, you can lie to the bank about your financial position.<br><br>Then along comes a shock of some sort. Interest rates go up, it is realized that bubble.com is an empty shell sitting on expensive chairs, the economy pauses. Suddenly those assets no longer appreciate as quickly or at all. The return is less than the return on the asset. <br><br>This leads to step two, the panic. Loans are called due, prices are dropping below purchase price so holders want to dump. Time to get out as fast as possible, there is a panic to get to the exits.<br><br>Then step three is the crash. The assets are no longer sellable at any cost and it all comes tumbling down.<br><br>What could be the fourth stem or even the first step to the next bubble, banks try to solve the problem so they dump money and lower interest rates. Investors find something else, wheat, rice, oil, whatever and away we go again.<br><br><a href=#c9007336334430811845 title="comment permalink">4/17/08, 6:36 AM</a><br><br>

I agree with your assessment of the life expectancy of the average book - but I didn't expect the books we have now to last for very long, honestly. What I AM hoping they will do is bridge the knowledge gap for a few decades during the worst of the transition times. If we're smart, that will be long enough to relearn a bit of what was lost.

But there's plenty of unamended clay left to play with from the pond we dug last year, sitting piled in the back part of the yard. I don't know how it will work for pottery on its own. Many commercial clays are mixes and I expect formulating a good clay mixture for throwing and firing without experiencing cracking or other serious flaws is a science not quickly mastered.

Food pantries are getting hit harder, but the farmers that can are selling to them at reasonable prices -- helps the pantries and the farmers.

It's on tile-making actually, but it talks about the different types of clay, their properties, what types of forms they're best used for, etc. Clays that are too pliable generally aren't good for tiles for instance, because they won't stay flat through the firing. If you're interested in making tiles, save your fired 'failures' too, because they can be broken up and mixed in with fresh clay.

And, beside climate change, we have messed our environment in so many ways that its likely there is quite a few more surprises in store. Carbon and nutrient cycles have been altered at an unprecedented pace in the last century and I dont think anybody can be certain about the consequences. Carbon in oil reserve has been trapped during the Paleozoic. Even with all that C sequestered from the atmosphere, extinctions linked to anoxic ocean occurred, the last major one dates from the Cretaceous. Its not just about raising temperature and raising water level. Its about a switch in biochemical conditions which will favorise certain lifeforms over others. More evolved lifeforms thrive along the line of photosynthesis- Krebbs cycle. If there is a significant switch in ocean chemocline, anaerobic bacteria may start releasing H2S and methane in large quantity closer to the surface, and that wont be good. The creeping dead zones around coastlines due, in part, nutrient loaded water from agricultural watersheds are not reassuring signs of what is in store. That being said, its certainly not the time to give up. Nobody knows where the chips will fall and hope and caution are "de rigueur".<br><br>One of main difference between real estate and any other kind of goods is that land is limited and more so as population increases. Buildings fall apart over time, but land, albeight degraded, remains and is necessary for all terrestrial life. Price for lands tend to increase and will do so for a while as competition for its access is related to population growth. <br><br>Awlknotted up wrote about Missouri with a great combo of available farms, innovative farmers and great towns like Springfield. When we searched for a farm a few years ago, this was one of the place we considered seriously. Arkansas had lots of potential as well. We travelled lots of North America, from Newfoundland to California and even spent a month in Costa Rica, finally settling for Eastern Canada. Despite my husband being from California, we basically wrote off all the West Coast because the price of land was just outrageous. Its beautiful and culturally enticing, but for one cash limited, the West Coast is not where one gets the biggest bang for his buck.<br><br>Maintaining specialisation along the line of farmers-craftmen would be a good thing. I think farms are more productive and more in balance with the ecosystems when mix farming is the norm, which means combining a diversity of animals to a diversity of plants. This does not leave much time and brain space to do anything else. Which leaves transformation of raw fibers, food, leather to specialists. Maybe the future is a linkage between small scale shops and farms. We already see the emergence of this because the price of raw material is so low that farmers often add transformation to their activities. I saw also the reverse, for example, cheesemakers looking for local farmers to produce high quality milk. <br><br>IMO, some specialists who do not accomplish any "real" productive work, such as lawyers, priests, politicians, stock brokers are more of a nuisance than anything else. Its only with centralisation and concentration of power that we justified feeding people full time to do those jobs. We have created a class of people disconnected from the biological world and from physical labor to rule over the people who produce the real "goods". On the other side, spirituality, economy, politics and laws are everybody concerns and all should assumed their share of it, as part of the priviledge and responsability of living in a community. For better and worst, we are social animals and our biggest common ground is how we interact with each other and with our environment as a species. I believe, in life, there are the small questions and the big ones. A small question is the domain of the specialist, it could be something such as how much bonemeal to grow brocoli, what's the best wool for felting.... The big questions pertain to what constitutes our common ground, to ethic, philosophy, meaning of life: what do we live for, what is the common good, what is justice...The last kind of questions are just too fundamental to be left answered by small, powerful groups of interests.<br><br><a href=#c5907726937831528264 title="comment permalink">4/18/08, 8:59 AM</a><br><br>

Among other things, this would identify geographic areas where there are strong centers of multiple skills and "impoverished" areas where the skills will be needed. Also, it could give a profile of coverage of the various skills, indicating which ones are widely available and which are scarce. If anyone's interested in seeing something like this come about, contributing to it, critiquing it, etc., leave a comment here or write to me at fe001@dondwiggins.net (disposable email address that will be changing soon). I'd be willing to host a first cut at it on my Wiki that I mentioned a while back.

And games too, be they board games or foot races or scavenger hunts, etc. <br><br>It's nice to have some idle time for doing nothing in particular, too. Sometimes, even in the midst of a really busy day -- or even sometimes because it's so busy -- I'll take a half hour to do something else - meditate, walk, read a book, take a nap. Then the rest of the day usually goes better.<br><br>It's true that being a jack/jill-of-many-trades often means being very busy, with little downtime. But I still manage to find a bit of downtime here and there. And really, if I want to be of use to others, I have to make sure I get rest, eat right, etc. If that means taking a break from helping other people learn things or whatever, do it. Unless it's a life-threatening emergency, most things can wait a few hours or a few days. Heck, right now even my strawberries have to wait, because I can't dig for as long as I'd like. <br><br>Of course, one of the upsides of having lots of bits of knowledge is that some of the people you help will remember how to do what you did, and then they can help spread that help/knowledge.<br><br>I'm more of a materials artist than a storyteller, but I am getting a little time in on my artwork. I like being able to combine them though -- like a hooded sleeveless jacket I've been working on, for hiking in the woods. I had a lot of fun choosing colors and cutting and matching them, doing funky things like parti-colored pockets (but still in functional shapes of course). Just need to get some toggle buttons and I'll have a cool piece of clothing that's unique and will last for years.<br><br>One of the things that keeps me busy is teaching others, or working on plans for workshops for the future. My feeling is that the more practical skills people have, the more capable they will be of handling whatever life hands them. Also, even if they don't need some of the skills often, they feel more confident and secure, and that is the sort of person who is more likely to respond well in a crisis, be it short-term or long-term.<br><br>Speaking of schedules, I've taken this morning pretty slow, getting in some reading and such, but now it's time to scram! We have a bunch of folks coming over tomorrow to hang out, talk, maybe do some archery and craft stuff, and the sugarhouse and the outhouses need a little more spiffing up! Which included finishing assembling a double rack for cases of fonts for our hobbyist print shop, and I'm sure Lyle would appreciate some help moving those :)<br><br><a href=#c8878824160871899790 title="comment permalink">4/19/08, 7:58 AM</a><br><br>

Healing modalities that don't require the huge inputs of energy and industrial products required by modern medicine are going to be in high demand -- where they're not banned, for that matter, they're in high demand already. I plan on discussing this in a later post. <br><br>Awl, you need to come out to Oregon sometime. The city of Portland has more microbreweries in it than any other US state. One book surveying the microbrew revolution simply called Portland "Beervana." We don't have quite as many down in the southern end of the state where I live, but we've got some excellent local and northern California brews, and a very large number of competent homebrewers. <br><br>J Rob, my best guess is that the microprocessor will be a thing of the past well within this century for a variety of reasons. Perhaps the most important, though, is that the balance of price between human and machine energy is shifting back toward its preindustrial level -- in the future, it will be much cheaper to hire and train a person to process data than to buy and power a machine to do it. More on this in a later post. <br><br>Teresa, the problem with thinking of books as a short term resource is that we have no way to know what techniques and knowledge will be of most use to our grandchildren's grandchildren. That's the value of books as an extrasomatic memory -- and that makes the preservation of knowledge crucial. More on this in another post!<br><br>Shadowfoot, no part of the country actually got out of the last recession; for that matter, broad measures of prosperity such as median income corrected for real inflation have been contracting for many years. The last few bubbles papered over the cracks for a while -- but now the bill appears to be coming due. <br><br>Marielar, anoxic conditions in the oceans are a real possibility -- and another good reason to stay away from the coasts! -- but that's one of the ways the earth removes excess carbon from circulation, after all. <br><br>Farfetched, that combination -- sensible specialization, together with a good grasp of general skills -- is probably the best ticket to survival there is. <br><br>Dwig, sounds like a good plan. <br><br>Stephen, the ready availability of salvage seems to have been one of the major factors in the collapse of so many industries in the wake of Rome's fall, so you may be right -- unless deliberate steps are taken to preserve knowledge now. <br><br>As for climate change, though, I think you're running far ahead of the facts -- while temperatures can change very fast, glacial melt takes a lot longer due to the sheer thermal inertia of that much ice. Even with the 15 degree F. spike in global temperature at the end of the last ice age, it took several thousand years for the continental glaciers to melt; there were sudden floods that jolted sea level up many feet in a hurry, but that still doesn't justify your claims.<br><br>As for subsistence issues, remember that agriculture came into being during the climate chaos at the end of the last ice age; one of farming's advantages, when it's practiced intensively on a local scale, is that it's more forgiving of climate variations than most other modes of human subsistence.<br><br><a href=#c959761012968999332 title="comment permalink">4/20/08, 12:30 AM</a><br><br>

For better or worse, this activity has persisted for century after century, and was one of the main forces that created the publishing revolution in the first place. Hard times seem to encourage it rather than suppress it; generation after generation manages to see their own particular troubles as the fulfillment of prophecy and the harbinger of the kingdom of their god, spurring bible production. I doubt peak oil as the latest "End Times" scenario will be any different, and that community will give up food before they will give up the drive to get a Bible in the hands of every person on earth to speed their Messiah's return. As long as this keeps the publishing and distribution structure intact at some level, there will remain the ability to publish and distribute other books as well, especially practical guides for living in the new and unexpected realities when you aren't praying for supernatural intervention.<br><br><a href=#c5597989059818845012 title="comment permalink">4/20/08, 7:26 AM</a><br><br>

I never took part in this, but I was impressed by the efforts of many of the members to achieve total authenticity in clothing and trappings, which meant going to the length of weaving the cloth yourself on your own loom from fibers that were actually in use during the time period in questions. <br><br>Many people out here feel the urge to acquire basic skills but live in the present, and must deal with the contemporary situation, meaning that we have to spend enough time and energy just to remain competitive in ours professions or vocations, that it seems wasteful to allocate any portion of that time to acquiring a body of knowledge and skills that have no applicability in your life as you live it right now, unless it is your chosen hobby. As it is, the pace of change throws enough curve balls at most people, requiring most of us to retool at an advanced age because our previous vocation or skill set has become obsolete. <br><br>Moreover, it's difficult to sort out just which will be relevant and which won't in a resource-short future, because it is difficult to project just how the decline is going to play out over your lifetime. You might find, for example, that you acquired, at no small cost and effort, the skill set to weave cloth and making clothing, or to make pottery and related products, just to be in a situation where there are many people, as well as materials, available, to supply your community, while some more esotoric, and technological, skill that is badly needed, is totally lacking anywhere. <br><br>At this time, I am collecting books and other instructional material on manufacturing basic things that will be needed to be manufactured locally when it becomes economically unfeasible to import them any more. These are things that used to be manufactured in most of our major city areas. This is a large undertaking, but I would like to assemble a library that could be a resource for people trying to build a functional community from scratch, and I hardly know where to start.<br><br><a href=#c5502116192093073432 title="comment permalink">4/20/08, 9:20 PM</a><br><br>

But its possible that even if it falls apart, the internet will leave a trace of a more global consciousness, less prone to endoctrination by gurus and other spiritual leaders. The net is the medium for postmodernism, in a Marshall McLuhan sense. It seems to me that while still strugling for meaning, following the deconstruction of old ideologies, we are more open and more willing to forge our own spiritual path. In general, religion has become less of an institutional thing and more a personal quest. The net has really stir up something by linking people who otherwise would never had the opportunity to exchange and brought to light how our versions of the truth are fragmentary and vernacular. We still are tribal, but, in some small ways, willing to admit that other tribes have something valid to add to the gumbo. Spiritual "specialization" is a form of adaptation, an ecology of the mind, so to speak. But there is also universals, like the necessity of compassion and a quest for meaning. Some spiritual specializations, not only are obsolete, but destructive and will go extinct. Yet, the need for a spiritual life is still there, and IMO, we are looking for new forms which will embody the universals. The approaching collapse will spell the failure of our leaders and our institutions and I dont see people turning back to them for guidance. In a strange twist, after centuries looking at the celestial bodies for answers, we are turning our eyes to our own little planet, shifting from astrology to Gaia. If we go back to our Bibles, it will be with whole new interpretations.<br><br><a href=#c1578468705301858729 title="comment permalink">4/21/08, 9:00 AM</a><br><br>

Mind you, religion tends to become more popular during the collapse of civilizations; I suppose you could say that salvation is one of the few resources not subject to depletion curves. <br><br>North Coast, start with some of the general books on low-tech and appropriate tech survival skills written during the last round of energy crises in the 1970s -- you can get those for a few bucks in the used book market nowadays, and many of them cover the basics quite well. Remember the basics -- food, water, shelter, clothing, health -- and go from there. <br><br>Marielar, I don't know that the internet has much to do with it, except to facilitate contact among some of the smaller and odder religions (such as mine), but there's certainly a spiritual ferment under way -- another common event in the decline and fall of civilizations. If it's like others of the same kind, it'll produce some monstrosities and some genuine insights, and send the history of the future spinning off in unexpected directions. <br><br>Dan, the internet has been a real benefit for the Druid order I head, but the reason is that we moderate our online forums. We have a clear civility policy, and people who violate it are moderated or expelled from the list. The Druid email lists that don't do this are the same kind of screaming mess you've described.

He's re-honing some of his rustier farming skills while telecommuting to his specialized job in computers, and I'm learning a bit of the assistant-type roles, while working on growing not only more fruits and veggies but also cooking, medicinal, and dye plants. <br><br>The real herbalist is a friend of mine who's talking about going for master herbalist certification, but I can handle the basics, and read herbal books intelligently. We'll be learning how to use her tincture press sometime this year.<br><br>There are other weavers in this area, but seriously, if/when machine manufacturing of fabric goes away, more than one weaver will be needed. And if it takes 50 years for it to go away, redundancy in instructors now will better ensure there are weavers 50 years from now. Same goes for a lot of other skills -- redundancy is a good thing, because we are fighting the odds for the survival of these skills during the transition, and because one person can only provide so much material for other people, be it food, fabric, pottery, medicine, or other useful things.<br><br>I'm personally hoping I never have to get into raising animals myself, but I'm happy to support my local dairy farmers. We may get into raising chickens at some point though, because the majority of farmers in this area still buy the chicks and then raise them (usually for meat or eggs). There are at least six farms with sheep within a 15 mile radius of here, probably more, which means I don't have to raise sheep to get wool for my weaving or knitting -- all of them breed their stock, and we have a variety of different types of sheep, so that's a fairly stable part of our area.<br><br>I think it's great that you're gathering a resource library together. Some books I'd recommend if you don't have them already, are _The Self-Sufficient Life and How to Live It_ by John Seymour, _Gaia's Garden_ (Permaculture) by Toby Hemenway, _The Herbal Medicine-Maker's Handbook_ by James Green, _Brew Ware: How to Fine, Adapt &amp; Build Homebrewing Equipment_ by Karl F. Lutzen &amp; Mark Stevens, _The Forager's Harvest_ by Samuel Thayer. <a href=http://www.sharonastyk.com rel=nofollow>Sharon Astyk</a> has some decent lists of useful books at her site, definitely worth checking out.<br><br>Anyway, while covering the basics in your library (maybe some books from Lindsay Publications too?), check out the strengths and weaknesses in your community. See what hobbyist groups are around, how active 4-H is, what the physical resources for your area are. <br><br>For instance, if water is a problem, think about putting a rainwater catchment system together, at least for yourself, or at the house of someone you know who has the land for doing this. For cities, maybe check out what they're doing in places like Portland or Seattle in Oregon? Research for preparedness requires some creative thought, but can be quite rewarding, as you build a more complete picture of how things go together.<br><br>That's one of the things I use the internet for -- searches for textile/fiber arts guilds/groups, sheep farms, localharvest.org for local foodstuffs, your state gov't's web site should have stuff on their Cooperative Extension and other aggie stuff like farmers markets, etc.<br><br>Heather G<br><a href=http://helwen.livejournal.com rel=nofollow>helwen.livejournal.com</a><br><br><a href=#c1888524357990389181 title="comment permalink">4/22/08, 6:50 AM</a><br><br>

Bras, especially nursing and maternity bras make a huge amount of difference to the comfort of many women. I am hoping a few of the dressmakers in my town would like to learn bra making together. When we have the basic construction skills down, perhaps we will be able to look into localizing the fibre supply; knitting machines can make stretch fabrics from local fibres if we can get them fine enough.
