During the last month or so, these essays have tried to present an extended critique of the very common notion that we can collectively plan for, and achieve, the future that we decide we want. By now, though, that point has been pushed about as far as it will go. Those of my readers who are going to get my point have gotten it, and are likely more than ready to go on to something else, while those who continue to believe they can order up a future to go will continue to believe that no matter what gets said here.<br><br>Still, that discussion leads on to a further question, one that can’t reasonably be avoided here. Given that I don’t think much of the prospects of planning a desirable future and then making it happen, what am I suggesting instead? That’s a harder question to answer than to ask, because the only answer I have to offer presupposes certain things about what we can know about the future, and those have to be clarified first. The same thing is true, to be sure, about the attempts to plan the future I’ve critiqued. If we could know where history is headed and what influence our actions could have on it, making firm plans for the future would be a safe bet. Equally, if it’s impossible for us to know anything at all about the future, then all bets are off, no course of action is more likely to succeed than any other, and the only option left would be moment-by-moment improvisation.<br><br>Still, it seems to me that neither of these extremes fits our situation. There are certainly things ahead that we will never expect until they show up on the doorstep, but not everything about the future falls into this category. An interesting distinction also lies between many of the things we can know about and many of the things we can’t: very often, we have no way of knowing what will happen, but we can predict very accurately that certain things won’t happen, and we can also accurately predict the <span style="font-style: italic">kinds of things</span> that will happen.<br><br>A specific example may help show how this works. Some years ago, when the late housing bubble was shifting into overdrive, quite a number of people – I was among them, though I didn’t have a public platform for my predictions in those days – noted the acceleration in housing prices and drew two conclusions. The first was that those who insisted real estate could increase in value forever were wrong: not just a little bit wrong, but utterly, catastrophically wrong. The second was that if real estate kept zooming up, there was going to be a massive crash. (Those who see this as 20/20 hindsight may visit the <a href=http://housingpanic.blogspot.com>Housing Panic </a>blog, one place where these predictions appeared.)<br><br>Both predictions, it’s worth noting, were based on the evidence of history. Ever since market economies evolved the capacity to support speculative bubbles, people have lost their senses at intervals over some investment or other: tulips, stock, real estate, precious metals, commodities, you name it. The infallible sign that this has happened is the claim that the investment in question is exempt from supply and demand and will just keep increasing in value. I think most of us remember when exactly these things were said about tech stocks, and it’s been rather les than a year since many people insisted that the same things were true about petroleum: wrong in both cases, and in every other case in human history. Thus we can know something about the future: we can accurately predict that no speculative investment will rise in value indefinitely.<br><br>The second prediction followed on the heels of the first. Because millions of people were climbing aboard the real estate bandwagon, and prices were zooming upwards, it was a safe bet that eventually prices would slump, people would sell off their investments, and the result would be a crash; that’s the way every speculative bubble in history has ended. Thus the bloggers on Housing Panic knew the kind of thing the future would hold: a collapse in real estate prices in which a great many people would lose a huge amount of money. Those who noticed that banks were loaning money recklessly to speculators also knew that many banks would go under; again, that’s the kind of thing that happens when greed trumps caution and banks forget that money should only be loaned to people who can pay it back.<br><br>What nobody knew was when the crash would come, what would trigger it, and how it would play out. This is the difference between knowing what kind of thing will happen and knowing what will happen. Nothing is more difficult than timing a bubble. Isaac Newton, arguably one of the brightest human beings who ever lived, tried to time the market during the South Sea Bubble and lost most of his money. (Any of my readers who consider themselves smarter than Newton are invited to try to predict the turning point of the current bubble in US treasury bills. Since the bursting of that bubble will probably put what’s left of the global economy into cardiac arrest, this is by no means a purely academic exercise.)<br><br>These same considerations apply to any attempt to predict the future, and in particular to the central theme of this blog, the twilight of industrial civilization and the long descent into a new dark age. Civilizations, like speculative bubbles, have promoters who insist they can keep on going forever; just as with bubbles, announcements of that sort have historically been a clear sign that serious trouble is not too far off. It’s a safe bet, in any case, that every bubble will pop and every civilization will decline and fall. Those who are heavily invested in a particular bubble or civilization will of course insist that it’s different this time, just as their predecessors did; those claims have been wrong so far, and the evidence isn’t favoring them this time, either.<br><br>It’s quite possible, in turn, to predict the kind of things that will happen as industrial civilization lurches down the uneven slope of decline. Plenty of civilizations have done that before, and the common features stand out clearly from history; some of these features are already visible in the present case – it’s educational to page through Spengler or Toynbee and note how many features of a declining civilization had not yet appeared in their time, but have shown up on schedule in ours. What nobody can know in advance is just how these trends will work out in detail. <br><br>This is the perspective on the future that frames the proposals I’ve made here and elsewhere for coping with the long descent ahead of us. It’s certainly possible to know in advance some of the things that won’t happen. For example, declining civilizations always seem to get prophets who insist that some vast and improbable transformation will suddenly replace their civilization with the kind of society they would rather inhabit. They are always wrong, and such prophecies should be seen as signs of the times rather than knowledge about what will actually happen.<br><br>Set such fantasies aside, and it’s not that difficult to predict the kind of things that will happen as our civilization runs down. Mass migrations, for example, usually take place when civilizations collapse; the tidal force of migrant workers and refugees streaming across today’s borders is already making headlines, so it’s a safe bet this process will shift into high gear in the future. On the other hand, it’s anyone’s guess how those migrations will affect individuals and communities in any given corner of the world. I’ve suggested in these essays, for instance, that the western shores of North America may end up receiving some millions of refugees by sea from Japan. The Japanese islands can only support a small fraction of their current population on local resources; the northern Pacific currents go the right direction, and Japan has a huge and capable merchant marine and fishing fleet, so means, motive, and opportunity are present. <br><br>None of this makes the arrival of the first rusting container ship full of refugees on an Oregon beach a certainty. For all we know, Japan might purchase eastern Siberia from a disintegrating Russia thirty years from now, and settle its extra population there; it might go to war with China and suffer losses so drastic that the point becomes moot; or some other unexpected turn of events might set history in motion down a different path. What we do know is that as fossil fuels run short and importing food becomes a strategy without a future, a large fraction of the population of Japan will either relocate or die; what they do about that bitter choice is less predictable.<br><br>Thus the knowledge we can get provides no basis for making a future to order, but potentially allows room for something beyond improvisation. Since a miracle is not going to bail us out from the results of our collective mistakes, we need not waste time waiting for one, and can get to work in more practical ways. Since the kind of things that happen early in a civilization’s decline are tolerably well documented, we can assess trends already at work in the areas where we live, and guess at the near-term challenges we are likely to face. Since the endpoint of the process of decline is also fairly well documented, we can try to anticipate what things, readily available now, will be scarce and useful to our descendants, and do what we can to see that those things get passed down the chain of years to the waiting hands of the future.<br><br>Now it’s true, of course, that none of these options are foolproof. Even with the guidance of history, it’s possible to misjudge the shape of the future disastrously, and even those who guess the future in advance may not be able to avoid its dangers. This is why the concept of dissensus, introduced last week, is vital just now: as any ecologist can tell you, in the face of unpredictable change, the wider the range of variation in a species, the more likely that some of them will have what it takes to adapt. A monoculture of ideas, organizational styles, or paradigms is just as vulnerable as a monoculture of living things, and so our best option just now is to encourage disagreement, so as to foster as many different approaches to the future as possible.<br><br>The need for dissensus, it should be stressed, does not simply cover the technologies different individuals and groups might decide to pursue, the organizations they might choose to make or support, or the survival strategies that might seem most promising to them. It also reaches into the realm of ends. I have said this several times in recent posts, but it bears repeating: we have no idea what kind of society is best suited to a world after industrialism. It’s far more likely than not, in fact, that such a society will have little in common with the notions that middle-class intellectuals in the industrial world today might have of it. This doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t try to imagine such a society; it does mean that attempts to push diverse visions into a single consensus are as unproductive as they are futile. <br><br>Diversity in the realm of ends, finally, also applies to the most basic decisions about the way the predicament of our time is framed. For some people, the most meaningful challenge focuses on rebuilding communities to help them and their residents get through the end of the age of abundance. For others, it focuses on building new societies they hope will replace the one we have now. For still others, it focuses on developing new technologies, or rescuing old ones, to replace those that will stop working when today’s lavish energy supplies run out. There are those for whom raw survival is the most important thing, and there are those who have come to terms with the inevitability of death and are pursuing other goals.<br><br>Which of these choices is the best? Wrong question. All of them, and more, are necessary parts of a dissensus-based approach to the crisis of industrial civilization. As you read these words, members of a city council in a Midwestern college town may be mulling over a project that will pull their community through hard times, while activists one town over, with the best intentions in the world, devise a similar program that will fail and take their town’s future with it. One ecovillage in Ohio may be inventing social forms that will evolve into the neotribal societies of the 22nd century, while another attempt on similar lines sparks quarrels that tear a community to shreds. One hobbyist in Montana, staring at pictures of a 19th century solar steam engine, may start making the prototype of a machine that will become the prime energy source of the ecotechnic age, while others miss the necessary insight and waste their lives on dead ends.<br><br>What adds spice to the irony is that we have no way of knowing in advance which is which. All any of us can do is pursue the work that calls to us individually, cooperate with others who share the same commitment, take the measures to weather the crisis that seem to make sense from where we are, and remember that those who disagree with us most heartily may be assembling their own piece of a puzzle that is, ultimately, bigger than any of us.

Therefore, I completely agree that "All any of us can do is pursue the work that calls to us individually, cooperate with others who share the same commitment, take the measures to weather the crisis that seem to make sense from where we are, and remember that those who disagree with us most heartily may be assembling their own piece of a puzzle that is, ultimately, bigger than any of us." I'm still planning on trying to create that desirable future--which is the work that 'calls to me'--and support others doing similar work, as well as those working in different directions. No one can know what will work, but but I know what won't: just criticizing the efforts of others will not help bring about anything worthwhile. Each of us has to get out and do our piece of the work.<br><br><a href=why-dissensus-matters.html#c5424347091661791401 title="comment permalink">12/17/08, 5:52 PM</a><br><br>

Your discussion of financial bubbles is certainly backed by history. There is another bubble due to burst. Perhaps you have purposefully avoided discussion of the coming dieoff of Homo Sapiens Sapiens. Viewed from the perspective of geologic time, the growth curve of humans over the past few centuries has been quite steep. By the same reasoning you have applied to other bubbles, the assurance of a massive human dieoff is 100%. What is unknown is when, and maybe how. After all, would it be difficult to organize a worldwide lottery for a limited number of newborns to drastically reduce population within a few generations? Only if humans can perceive the human bubble would this be considered. A significant refinement of human perceptions would be needed. "Over population" is not today even whispered publicly. Jay Hanson has produced a remarkable site devoted to this topic at http://dieoff.org.<br><br>Dissensus seems another word for diversity. We see the example of diversity within the natural world and understand its yield is resilience. It is also possible to see widely ranging diversity among indigenous cultures, a proven way of sustainable human existence. In fact, it was my search for the writings of David Holmgren (who points out the indigenous/sustainable link) that led me to the Dieoff site and along with my mate Bonnie, to begin work towards our own idea of human sustainability at <a href=http://entropypawsed.org rel=nofollow>EntropyPawsed</a><br><br><a href=why-dissensus-matters.html#c1946601291842777860 title="comment permalink">12/17/08, 6:10 PM</a><br><br>

They're fearful of the future in a way they've never been before. Many are hoping against hope that they will be holding some sort of golden bag or parachute when the dust clears and the crisis passes. And this is, in fact, a strategy which is part and parcel of this larger process of dissensus. <br><br>Would you please, in a future post, take the time to lay out three to five common-sense precautions that you think would be beneficial if <i>most</i> people took them, even if not all of them did?<br><br><a href=why-dissensus-matters.html#c1387657807976012971 title="comment permalink">12/17/08, 8:34 PM</a><br><br>

You may recall that my commentary on the Transition Town movement ended by suggesting that it was an experiment worth pursuing -- it's just not the only game in town. <br><br>Bmerson, I see it as more of a balance; it's good to have an open mind, but not so open that one's brains fall out. <br><br>Frank, I've discussed the coming depopulation explosion in several earlier posts, <a href=../../2007/06/depopulation-explosion.html rel=nofollow>this one</a> in particular. It's certainly an issue that has to be faced. <br><br>SouthFlorida, I'll take that under consideration.

I'll certainly consider a post on practical precautions. As for Madoff, though, remember that he robbed some of the wealthiest people in America, and the fiscal bloodshed in the hedge funds has also primarily hit the rich -- who owns hedge fund shares, after all? One of the interesting things about depressions is that income becomes more evenly distributed in society during them, and the flattening of the rich by speculative busts is one of the reasons. <br><br>Arthur, you're most welcome.<br><br><a href=why-dissensus-matters.html#c1685798923708725959 title="comment permalink">12/17/08, 9:47 PM</a><br><br>

Everything I see tells me that, even leaving aside the intentional obstruction of selfish interests, the sheer inertia of the cheap fossil fuel/ exponential debt civilization pretty much rules out any real solution.<br><br>That's why I've checked out on macro-solutions. A few years ago I paid close attention to things like Kyoto, RESs, etc.; now I no longer do.<br><br>By now I think all concerned people can do is organize their own communities or lifeboats or whatever, try to come together with friends, family, neighbors (and offer education to those ready to hear it and to play a constructive role), to find some solution which works for them. Beyond that, we need to basically write off society at large as a loss.<br><br>[The only caveat I'd add is, since there certainly is the possibility that the power structure may try to organize a "fascist" solution, which <i>could</i> temporarily prevail, we do need to remain politically engaged to the extent of combatting any such attempts.<br><br>But beyond that, I'd say "politics" is a dry well.]<br><br><a href=why-dissensus-matters.html#c3527941539520215027 title="comment permalink">12/18/08, 1:48 AM</a><br><br>

Abrupt and catastrophic change makes for good story lines, but great changes spread over a long enough time scale are often hard to spot against the background noise of day-to-day life. <br><br>Dmitry Orlov's observation about the high mortality rates amongst certain demographics during the post-Soviet collapse becoming visible only in hindsight and after studying the statistics comes to mind.<br><br>I had a project I was working on in Renmark in South Australia, an irrigation area on the Murray River, some years ago which involved an eight hundred kilometer drive on several occasions from where I live in Southern Victoria, a green and quite densely settled and prosperous coastal region. Much of it through very parched marginal wheat growing land in Western Victoria and I was struck by the advanced decay visible in many of the towns along the way. Collapsing fences and outbuildings, closed and fenced off fuel outlets and motels on the edges of towns: and yet none of this was in the daily news or on the lips of my fellow citizens in daily discourse.<br><br>In the same way, the world could go through a huge population decline over several generations almost imperceptibly as far as those living through it were concerned. Of course there are the poster children of catastrophe such as the genocide in Rwanda or the present disaster in Zimbabwe, but Russia, Italy and Japan will most likely have radically smaller populations in fifty years time through fairly subtle changes in demographics and fertility rates.<br><br>We must remember the radical changes we have lived through on the way up: my father died in December last year and just before he did I congratulated him on his timing, managing to go out at the very peak of industrial civilizations expansion. Yet when he was born the world's population was a third of what it now is, there was no TV, radio was a novelty, there were no refrigerators or washing machines in ordinary homes and people died in great numbers from simple infections.<br><br><a href=why-dissensus-matters.html#c7429361589370080348 title="comment permalink">12/18/08, 2:46 AM</a><br><br>

Right now, I recommend the <a href=http://www.futurescenarios.org/content/view/37/45/ rel=nofollow>Conclusion</a>, and particularly this bit: "We must commit to concrete actions and projects. We must stake our claim, not for ourselves but for the future. In committing to our task we should remember the stories of Pythagoras and the monks of Lindisfarne. It is not the project but the living process that will be the measure of our actions. Let us act as if we are part of nature's striving for the next evolutionary way to creatively respond to the recurring cycles of energy ascent and descent that characterise human history and the more ancient history of Gaia, the living planet. Imagine that our descendants and our ancestors are watching us."<br><br>I recently saw a video clip of a talk by Buckminster Fuller in 1983. One point he made in passing stuck with me: "When I was born, humanity was 95% illiterate. Since I've been born, the population has doubled and is now 65% literate (a gain of 130x)." Returning to the Culture Conservation theme, I'd suggest that literacy is a crucial cultural "artifact" to be conserved; if we lose it, the way down will likely be much rougher. In this same vein, maybe we have here a factor that is truly new to this episode of civilizational decline; JMG, do you know of another case where the literacy rate at the peak was as high as today's?<br><br><a href=why-dissensus-matters.html#c4055290220573881386 title="comment permalink">12/18/08, 3:15 PM</a><br><br>

I really enjoyed your article,"Why Dissensus Matters", excellent as always.<br> <br>While I was reading it, in part, I was reminded of Grahams's thoughtless review of your book, "The Long Descent". While reading it, it quickly became obvious that this man knew little about about you, or what you're trying to convey... What a pity... Btw, I think, "The Long Descent" is a masterpiece, either for the beginner or someone who has studied peak oil or resource depletion for a great deal length of time....<br><br>Another part, is that of the up coming project that I'm trying to put together, "Catabolic Collapse, Detroit, Michigan". As I describe this, I hope it meets with your approval. I'd like it to be as true to form as if it was coming from your mind set (if that is possible). In my study of Spengler, I feel, that I've come to know you even better, as least having an idea from where you may be coming from.<br><br>Dissensus does matter, it's how I've grown to know you and your ideals, better... It's only through understanding each other, that cooperation can begin.<br><br>I'll very likely tie Japan in with my little project and agree whole hearted on your thought here, sad as it may be..

We seem to be forgetting that what is most important, regardless of what we feel may happen in the future, is the present moment.<br><br>So it's possible that while we are trying to plan for how our economy will work in a post-industrial world, we're wasting more time thinking than acting right now. It's like eating a meal at McDonald's while thinking of how we can plan a local food economy for the future. <br><br>And perhaps that is why humans have seen such a wave of rise and fall -- we're infatuated with predicting or planning for the future. But most of the time we end up missing every opportunity in the real world (right now) to ever have any positive effect. <br><br>Overall I think perception is half our battle. We want to believe we're working to help to guide the universe (or civilization). But as Hermes Trismegistus said, "You do not see the point, since you are always forgetting that the universe is not for your entertainment. It does not serve you; you serve it."<br><br><a href=why-dissensus-matters.html#c678461073373029718 title="comment permalink">12/19/08, 7:58 AM</a><br><br>

Yet any large system supports more than one adaptation. It's not just fox or squirel, or even fox AND squirel, as Dwig noted. <br><br>Nature -- even in harsh environments -- supports say, penguins and seals and whales and terns and paracites and sometimes humans (but I repeat myself). Rather than play Russian roulette by adapting in one way, and hoping to come out "the winner", we need to "love our enemies" -- not necessarily in the nicey-nice sense it's often, idealistically, presented, but in the sense of litterally supporting the success of our compettitors, or at least not messing with them unnecessarily. <br><br>As the "hippy era" devolved into a "yuppie" adaptation in the face of Reaganomics and other limitations, much of America's creativity was absorbed into Business. I heard a consultant doing a business conference to improve efficiency, and one key point was teaching businessmen to admit when they are wrong and to change their minds. There is usually a huge loss of efficiency in holding onto an inappropriate decision. The consultant wanted businesses to foster an atmosphere that favored changing one's mind when confronted with a new and superior argument. <br><br>That's what we need to do, too. Focussed as many of us have been on "culture wars", we really need to lighten up. If I torch a bunch of "gluttonous" mobile homes, there will be more competition for the available yurts. When the retired bank exec (who bought it new) kicks off, his hippy kids may make it the core of a cooperative farm venture. If my compettitor succeeds at a lifestyle, my daughter may be blessed with one more viable option in a decade or two, after my cob village rots away.<br><br>No one "right answer" is going to finally emerge. What is "THE right way" to live now? We are blessed with an evolving bundle of synthetic adaptations, and can combine tantric Indian wisdom with European socialism and the herbology of South America, or whatever. Preserving the range of options from which multiple, competing and combining adapations can adventurously emerge seems to me the very key to a liveable future.<br><br>To the extent that we can influence local government or egalitarian self-help societies, we should foster a live-and-let-live culture, so long as the core needs of the larger group are not damaged.<br><br><a href=why-dissensus-matters.html#c5317381846368313868 title="comment permalink">12/19/08, 8:31 AM</a><br><br>

So far it's held true.<br><br>As supply and demand get tight, speculators see the trend and pile on, the price of oil rises until the demand destruction takes hold.<br><br>Demand destruction has momentum and creates an economic chain reaction.<br><br>Each time, the Fed will respond by trying to spur the economy by increasing lending. The goal is infinite growth.<br><br>It's a bit like pumping the gas pedal to make the car go faster, when there's a clog in the fuel line. You can get short bursts of acceleration, then the engine stalls, becomes flooded as you pump the pedal, and it takes a while to get it going again...<br><br>Greenspan, Bernanke and Paulson are all trying to make the economy grow faster than it's physical inputs. They need it to grow to infinity and they will fight to achieve infinite economic growth at all costs. They've bought into the Flat Earth Philosophy of infinitely recyclable resources and are basing our policy upon this myth.<br><br>The goal now is to consolidate entities that are too big to fail into entities that are too gargantuan to fail. These entities must grow. So Paulson is stealing solvent banks and reselling them to insolvent banks at firesale prices, to proper up their balance sheets. I think that the next administration is likely to do the same with the auto industry.<br><br>They'll be forced into bankruptcy and sold off. Then the plants will be shut down and the workers fired, their pensions looted. We've seen the IMF do this before. Paulson knows the script. He's one of the players that participated in the rape of Argentina. Know he's turning his amorous eyes on the USA.<br><br>Now that Obama has picked Monsanto shills for top cabinet posts, we may soon see Monsanto get a bailout, so they can buy up family farms using taxpayers funds. After they drive them under of course.<br><br>So we'll hear endless speeches about how bailouts for Monsanto is the first step to saving family farms.

Because it certainly isn't unity.

That's a stark and refreshing contrast to the previous administration. <br><br>But a danger with dissensus, especially within a bureaucracy, is spreading resources too thinly to make any approach effective. That's what I'm afraid will happen with our dissensus on climate change. If we allocate pocket-change each to, say, ethanol farms, biodiesel research, solar development, carbon capture, offshore wind farms, fourth-generation nuclear plants, retrofitting existing infrastructure, hydrogen fuel cells, and conservation education, we may well hit on the right combination of strategies but not have the resources invested in each to get them far enough to be successful. The tenor of this discussion seems to be that our failure to deal with these challenges is something of a foregone conclusion, which may or may not be the case; I'm just offering this as an example of a way in which dissensus may be limited.<br><br><a href=why-dissensus-matters.html#c2465858502578367603 title="comment permalink">12/19/08, 6:18 PM</a><br><br>

Conflict also has a valid and, at times, beneficent place in the world. You might also reread my post -- I'm not suggesting that consensus and dissensus form some sort of polar opposition; I'm suggesting that they, and other methods distinct from both, are all options that should be on the table. <br><br>Kerrick, of course dissensus is limited. So is consensus. So is every other approach, and every other paradigm, that can be applied to any aspect of the universe of human experience. There ain't no such thing as One True Way. <br><br>Jacques, I don't think it's nihilistic or misanthropic to try to see human ideas about destiny and purpose as the culturally constructed narratives they are, and to try to get past them. I don't despise teleology; I find it unhelpful as a way of thinking about history. Nor do I despise industrial civilization, as you suggest; I simply recognize that neither messianic fantasies of salvation through progress nor narratives of demonization are much help in making sense of where we are and where we're going. I'll address this in more detail in a future post. <br><br>As for the value of my life, or anyone else's, value doesn't inhere in the bare fact of existence; the value of a life consists of what one does with it in the very brief time each of us has on this Earth.
