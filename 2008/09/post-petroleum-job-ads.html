The mismatch between the narratives of sudden apocalypse that shape so much of today’s debate about the future, on the one hand, and the sluggish pace at which the predicament of industrial society unfolds in the real world, on the other, found a poster child of sorts last weekend. During the days of uncertainty before Hurricane Gustav’s arrival on the Louisiana coast, some enthusiastic soul posted claims to the peak oil newsblog <a href=http://www.theoildrum.com>The Oil Drum</a> that the hurricane would bring industrial civilization itself crashing down in ruins.<br><br>I was pleased to note that this announcement seems to have fallen on unsympathetic ears. The Oil Drum’s forte is shrewd technical analysis, and its staff – if I may so describe the loose association of regular posters and commenters who give that excellent site its tone and direction – set aside such speculations and did their usual exemplary job, mapping out the oil platforms and refineries likely to be affected by Gustav and posting damage estimates that turned out to be fairly close to the picture now emerging on the ground. Gustav was a moderately strong storm; it forced the evacuation of nearly every offshore and coastal petroleum facility in the Gulf of Mexico, causing substantial short-term production losses; the long-term effects of the storm will not be clear for weeks, but all by itself, $30 billion or so in estimated damage piled atop an already faltering economy will certainly have an impact.<br><br>The difference between the fantasy of sudden collapse and the reality of one more localized jolt piling additional burdens on a stumbling society is well worth keeping in mind. Like the proverbial frog in the saucepan, those who think of apocalyptic collapse as the only way industrial civilization can break down are far less likely to notice the gradual changes in their environment that are leading in the same direction, just more slowly. It’s as though, to shift stories, the boy who cried wolf was convinced that immense armies of wolves would suddenly swoop down and eat up all the sheep in the world at once, and mistook every whistle of wind in the trees for the distant howling of the wolf pack to end all wolf packs; meanwhile, practically under his nose, real wolves – scruffy, undersized, and quite depressingly few in number compared to the massed uber-wolves of the fantasy – were picking off a sheep or two each day from the fringes of the flock.<br><br>As both these metaphors suggest, the fixation on sudden collapse has practical disadvantages. If you’re a frog in a saucepan, and the only idea of heat you’re willing to consider involves all the water in the saucepan suddenly flashing into steam, you probably won’t jump while your legs are still uncooked enough to do so; if you’re guarding sheep from wolves, and groups of wolves numbering fewer than fifty are beneath your notice, your sheep are going to be eaten. In the same way, there are plenty of practical steps that can be taken here and now by individuals, that will likely make the slow unraveling of industrial society much less horrific than it might otherwise be. Most of those steps would be, or at least appear to be, irrelevant in the face of sudden global catastrophe, and in fact it’s not uncommon to find believers in some such catastrophe dismissing these practical steps in exactly those terms.<br><br>Mind you, there are other reasons why those steps are easy to dismiss. Every one of them has a price tag of some sort, denominated in money, labor, comfort, convenience, or unimpeded access to the smorgasbord of distractions today’s industrial civilization offers its inmates. By contrast, our culture’s two dominant narratives about the future – the narrative of apocalypse and its twin and shadow, the narrative of inevitable progress – are popular at least in part because they push the necessity and the costs of change onto somebody else: the “they” who are expected to think of something just in time to keep progress on track, for example, or the supposedly faceless billions who are expected to hurry up and die en masse so that the flag of some future utopia can be pitched atop their graves.<br><br>I’ve talked about some of the steps in question already on this blog, but today I’d like to turn to something a bit different from those previous discussions: the question of how people will make a living during the long unraveling of the industrial age.<br><br>That’s a question that has received surprisingly little attention in recent years, and a good deal of that neglect, I think, can be laid at the door of the apocalyptic narrative. According to that narrative, after all, nothing much changes until everything does; you keep on punching the timeclock at your present job until the day that civilization falls apart, and then, if you happen to be among the survivors, you step into whatever new role the apocalypse has ordained for you – subsistence farmer, tribal hunter-gatherer, protein source for the local cannibal population, or what have you. At the same time, the absence of a 9-to-5 routine on the far side of apocalypse is likely to be an important source of the narrative’s popularity; I’m far from the only person who noticed, during the runup to the Y2K noncrisis, how many people predicting imminent doom seemed exhilarated by the notion that they would not have to go to work on January 2, 2000.<br><br>If I’m right and the descent into the deindustrial future unfolds over generations, though, that enticing prospect is not in the cards. Rather, the vast majority of us will need to earn our livings in a world that, while it will be changing around us, is extremely unlikely to change in ways that will make that process any easier than it is now. During the period I’ve described in other posts as the age of scarcity industrialism, something like today’s money economy will likely remain firmly in place, though the household economy and other forms of production and exchange outside the money economy will likely play a steadily growing role. During the age of salvage economies that I expect to follow the twilight of the industrial system, money of some sort will likely remain in use on a small scale, as it does in most dark ages, but most day-to-day transactions will take place via barter or other systems of exchange outside the money economy; again, that’s standard practice in dark ages. In both periods, though, people will work for their livings – and will likely work a good deal harder than many Americans do today.<br><br>Nor will their jobs be the same as the ones that employ most Americans nowadays. The flood of cheap abundant energy that surged through the industrial world during the twentieth century reshaped every dimension of the economy in its image, and nearly all the things we have grown up considering normal and natural are artifacts of that highly abnormal and unnatural state of affairs. Very few people in the industrial world today spend their workdays producing goods or providing necessary services; instead, pushing paper has become the standard employment, and preparation for a paper-pushing career the standard form of education. The once-mighty archipelago of trade schools that undergirded the rise of America as an industrial power sank with barely a trace in the second half of the twentieth century. I once lived three blocks away from the shell of one such school; it had been engulfed by a community college, and classrooms that once hummed with the busy noises of machine-shop equipment and the hiss of hot solder were being used to train a new generation of receptionists, brokers, and medical billing clerks<br><br>The postindustrial economy proclaimed by Daniel Bell many years ago, and accepted as an accurate description of economic reality since then, was never much more than a shell game. The societies of the industrial world were every bit as dependent on industry as they had ever been; they simply exported the industries to Third World countries where labor was cheap and environmental regulation nonexistent, and continued to reap the benefits back home. Those arrangements only worked, however, because cheap abundant energy made transport costs negligible, and systematic distortions in patterns of exchange pumped wealth from the Third World to a handful of industrial nations, providing the latter with the wherewithal to pay a very large fraction of their populations to do jobs that don’t actually need to be done. As energy becomes scarce and expensive again, and the imperial systems that concentrated the world’s wealth in a minority of nations are shredded by the rise of new centers of power, those arrangements will break down. As that happens, a great many goods and necessary services now done offshore will need to be done at home once again, and a great many professions that produce no goods and provide no necessary services will likely drop off the economic map. <br><br>Prophecy is a risky business at the best of times, but it’s worth hazarding some guesses about the jobs that will fill the post-petroleum job ads here in America over the next generation or so, through the years of the Great Recession and the disintegration of America’s overseas empire. Farmers are among the most likely candidates for the top of the list. By this I don’t mean subsistence farmers in rural ecovillages – their time is much further in the future, if it ever comes at all. Rather, market farmers tilling what is now suburban acreage to feed the dwindling cities, and rural farmers producing grains and other bulk crops for foreign exchange, will likely be in high demand, along with support professions such as agronomists.<br><br>Engineers form another set of trades likely to do well in the generation to come, especially those who know their way around energy production and distribution and the design, building, and maintenance of low-tech transportation networks. In the not too distant future, rail and canal transport will have to take over much of the work now done by trucks, and energy networks will have to cope with a fractious mix of alternative resources, dwindling fossil fuels, and massive conservation programs. The people who actually put the plans of engineers into effect, from skilled machinists all the way down to the gandy dancers who lay the rails, will also be able to count on steady paychecks.<br><br>Another suite of professions likely to do well barely exists today, though demolitions experts, junkyard workers, and people who run recycling and composting operations represent tentative forays into the territory. A huge fraction of America’s potential wealth in the postpeak years consists of manufactured objects that can either be refurbished and put back into circulation, or stripped of raw materials for reuse. When the electricity needed to power elevators and run heating and cooling systems is dizzyingly expensive when it can be had at all, for example, skyscrapers will be worth more as sources of refined metal than as buildings, and most of them will come down. On the other end of the spectrum, a great many consumer products that are now consigned to landfills when they break will be worth salvaging, repairing, and reselling once the cost of the necessary labor is cheaper than the cost of the energy and raw materials for a new model – a state of affairs that existed in America until the 1960s and will likely exist again within a decade or two. The salvage industries, as we may as well call them, may well turn out to be one of the major growth industries of the twenty-first century.<br><br>Other professions have their own possibilities. It’s a useful exercise to locate a city directory from the first half of the twentieth century and flip through the pages, noting the businesses that existed then but are nowhere to be found today. Those that meet actual needs, however unpopular they are as career tracks today, are likely to be more viable and more lucrative in a deindustrializing future than many professions fashionable today. The pundits and publicists of our economic system never seem to tire of explaining that tomorrow’s jobs will not be the same as today’s, and I suspect they may just be right; what they don’t expect, and I do, is that many of tomorrow’s hottest jobs will have more than a little resemblance to the careers of yesterday.<br><br>Those people who make preparations now to move into such jobs as they come open will be doing themselves and their communities alike a favor of no small worth. These preparations need to begin soon – while the time, resources, and knowledge base for many necessary skills are still readily accessible – and this requires, once again, some sense of the way civilizations actually fall, and a willingness to apply that slow, stumbling, unromantic but realistic model to the events going on around us right now.

I've been wondering how my own profession will be affected by a future of increasingly expensive energy. 19 years as an Emergency Department RN have seen many changes, with ever increasing use of high technology (read "high energy") diagnostics taking the place of "hands on" assessment. I suspect I may see a movement in the opposite direction as complex, energy intensive technologies become unmanageable, though maybe not until the latter portion of my career. I suspect that, eventually, Emergency Departments will come to an end as they are expensive and mostly viewed as necessary evils by many hospital administrations.

Concerning work, I'd like to read your views on the future of animal husbandry in the energy-scarce future. As animals can move, can often consume a wide variety of materials, and can be raised in small groups without elaborate infrastructure, could changes in this part of agriculture be early indicators of larger systemic changes?

You're a druid, and therefore you've distanced yourself from modern industrial society and can look at it with a clinical viewpoint. Most of us are in the middle of it and can't just step back like that. To those closer to the center, who grew up in the prosperous 90s and were promised a future of spaceships, robots, and intergalactic trade with other beings, the blow is absolutely devastating. Not only will we never get into space, but we can't even have the civilization we wanted here on Earth, or even keep our own going. I'm not sure if you know how much that hurts, deep down in the core.<br><br>That being said, I've come to think that Scarcity Industrialism may well be the best thing that could happen to us in many ways. We used to take pride in manufacturing quality American goods, and I'd like to see us doing so again, if only out of necessity.

Happily, we were able to find one open to the idea of creating a twenty year plan that is open to creating a new paradigm that includes the concepts of resource depletion and localization (if the community wants it). My husband and I have been working on growing food in Central Oregon. This is no small challenge, as the ground consists of 30 feet of volcanic ash with very little organic material in it. Plus, the temperatures regularly fluctuate 50 degrees in a day, and you can only count on 30 nights a year that don't freeze. But our gardening efforts are paying off. Lots of people around here have horses, so there is a lot of manure to enrich the soil. We keep chickens and that helps, too. With food prices rising, people are a lot more interested now. We find that having tools is important for a huge variety of needs. But, one person can't do everything, so to sustain a town in the future where goods are no longer rolling in like they used to will require specialization. We'll need a blacksmith, quilters, knitters of sweaters, small engine repairers, handymen of all sorts, a bakery, cheesemaker, fence installers, people who can plow the roads in the winter, bicycle repair shops, septic system installers,nurse practitioners, and on and on. Good, old-fashioned tradespeople and a town center that furnishes a central trading post for goods, services, and farmers market. Older people may need to think ahead and prepare rooms to rent out to younger people who will work in the garden or shovel snow in exchange for a roof over their heads. So much can be done if we have time to prepare and start taking a sustainable lifestyle seriously. Large, centralized schools that rely on long bus rides can be replaced with little cluster schools, maybe in a large home. They will need a neighborhood teacher or two. And, apprentice programs. Once you start planning ahead that way, it gets pretty exciting, I think. One of the consultants introduced a concept he called "aging in place." It was about creating a community that provides a sheltering environment for those of all ages so that you don't have to sell out and leave when you get old as well as niches that children can grow up and fill. Some of these paper shufflers actually have good ideas and can help with the transition if they are working for a community with a new intention.<br>freeacre<br><br><a href=post-petroleum-job-ads.html#c6341683302892874095 title="comment permalink">9/5/08, 12:25 AM</a><br><br>

Once upon a time (back in the dark ages) working-class families in the Us couldn't afford to own a dedicated freezer.So when they butchered a hog or bought a half a beef, or shot a deer, they would rent a freezer locker. A freezer locker is just what the name sounds like. A big walk-in freezer, with lockable partitions for storing meat owned by other people. I know as a kid, our family rented one every fall when my father would go halves on a beef with the next door neighbor. We would use up the beef by June or so. Every Saturday, all through the winter and spring, we would go down to the butcher shop (do those exist any more either?) and load up meat for the week. I doubt the butcher made much money on it, but he needed a freezer anyway, and we always wound up buying some bacon, or chicken or bologna on the way out. Anyway, someone with access to a dependable source of power, say 10 feet of water head for an undershot Pelton wheel, could make a steady living on renting freezer space.<br><br><a href=post-petroleum-job-ads.html#c6916916679590543946 title="comment permalink">9/5/08, 9:53 PM</a><br><br>

The two main lessons that come through with utter dependability are that (1) unexpected changes make any attempts to predict the future beyond about 10 years into the future utterly unreliable and (2) that when that future becomes the present it is usually very different to any we postulated.<br><br>Just look at the 20th century, the rise and fall of massive new social systems (communism, fascism and a bunch of lesser experiments) a complete rewriting of science and the wonderful/terrible, technologies that flowed from it changing human life forever, new economic and social systems that completely changed the way people arrange their lives. Of course, some of those “new” economic and social systems now seem to have been little more than old ideas in new packaging, ideas designed to transfer vast wealth from the mass of society to a small section of it.<br><br>And all of this in the space of one long human life.<br><br>Which is of course why I have problems with John Greer’s deindustrial future with it’s set stages such as scarcity industrialism, salvage economy and it’s final ecotechnic civilization form: It relies on too many conditions and limits staying pretty much as they are across centuries of future history. Isn’t gunna happen, at least not that neatly.<br><br>Yes, it’s a good model for short periods of time and for isolated, non-innovative cultures, it’s even quite likely that the final stage could be something very like an ecotechnic culture, but great flights of “black swan events” are likely to make the intermediate stages very different. Further, each region/nation is likely to have its own, different history.<br><br>Makes the head hurt doesn’t it? I kind of guess that is why so many people like the simple “apocalyptic collapse sometime real soon” model. It doesn’t take any more understanding than, say, Oprah or Dr Phil.<br><br>That said, I think John is right in thinking that the good, well paying, jobs of the near future are likely to be those where you actually produce something or do something with real stuff: It’s already happening here in Australia.<br><br>I also reckon he is dead on with the statement “Farmers are among the most likely candidates for the top of the list. By this I don’t mean subsistence farmers in rural ecovillages – their time is much further in the future, if it ever comes at all. Rather, market farmers tilling what is now suburban acreage to feed the dwindling cities, and rural farmers producing grains and other bulk crops for foreign exchange, will likely be in high demand, along with support professions such as agronomists.”<br><br>At least where I live this seems to be already happening. Australian grocery shopping is utterly controlled by just a couple of huge chains. They now seem to be handcuffed by the very high profit margins they have established, that shareholders expect and on which executive bonuses depend, while being increasingly stressed by rising costs, especially transport.<br><br>The response to the sudden opening of an ecological niche has been dramatic here: Local farmers and farmer’s markets have sprung up or expanded so fast we can watch it happening. The farmers, you see, discovered that they could produce for the local market, sell their produce at the weekend markets at below the supermarket price, yet still receive much higher prices than the supermarkets were paying them.<br><br>Frankly, we were expecting more of a boom in home and community gardens (subsistence farmers). This is happening to some extent, but the real action seems to be a reinvention of the local farmer, a return in some ways to the arrangements of my youth.<br><br>As for “demolitions experts, junkyard workers, and people who run recycling and composting operations”, well, one of my oldest, most interesting and most disreputable friends is exactly all of the above (except for composting).

Currently our economic situation looks to be in an even more precarious position.

Consider that many of the worlds resources, fossil fuel etc., are at or beyond peak and the best in quality and ease of extraction having been used. Further the population of the world rich in those resources had a population of roughly 2 billion and it now stands at 6.7 billion.

A huge amount of jobs have been lost to such automation. Even if energy prices rise ten-fold in the long-run, such automation will remain cost-effective.<br><br>The point is that our ability to produce machines that cost-effectively replace human hands in almost anything except brain surgery remains intact after peak oil. In fact, the versatility and miniaturisation of such robotic factories - in effect - will get a boost as transport and labor costs continue to rise. That's a game changer.<br><br>Peak oil will reduce society's ability to consume and will render many types of jobs uneconomical, but it will not bring back jobs that have been made obsolete by industrial automation. As mechanical engineer I'm pretty confident about this.<br><br>Also, I don't believe transport costs of for example international shipping will be the main cause of relocation of manufacturing. The fuel costs of such transport systems will remain negligible as compared to the economic value of the cargo. Even after Peak Oil. The main driver of relocation of manufacturing will be the decreasing gap between labor costs as inflation grips the low-wage countries and the high-wage countries enter recession.<br><br><a href=post-petroleum-job-ads.html#c235940165114150886 title="comment permalink">9/9/08, 2:21 AM</a><br><br>

Nature, as usual, has the last word! Responding to all these comments is more than time will permit right now, so I'll restrict responses to a few. <br><br>Zach, I don't see much future in your specific specialty -- automated systems generally will be a lot fewer and further between in the years to come, since the energy needed to produce them (including the whole raw materials chain that feeds into them) will be nothing like so cheap as it's been. Might be a good time to hone your engineering skills in some less specialized fields. <br><br>Farfetched, I'm glad to hear that at least some of the old trade schools are still out there, though a career as an auto mechanic may not be all that durable. As for spare parts, the ability to make or salvage jerry-rigged equivalents is likely to be a major skill from here on in. <br><br>David, you've been looking into your crystal ball, I see -- the economics of retrofitting will be the subject of my next post. <br><br>Shark, I've discussed draft animals before, but you're right that I need to talk about animals generally as an economic factor in deindustrial societies. More on this later. <br><br>Yiedyie, I've never claimed that there won't be localized collapses and sudden crises -- in fact, those are integral to the vision of the future I've been proposing on this blog for the last two and a half years. My point is that these don't add up to the sudden total collapse of contemporary apocalyptic fantasy. As for stupidity, ignorance, and inertia, those are exactly the factors on which I'm founding my model -- they were old in the days of the Neanderthals, and they play the same role today that they did in the twilight years of every other civilization. <br><br>Straha, role playing games are a fad, and it's anybody's guess how long they'll remain popular -- how many people do you know that play with hula hoops these days? Nor will people have anything like as much spare money and time for such things as they do today. I wouldn't bet your future on it, in other words. <br><br>Losthorizon, I've addressed all this before. Of course the current financial system could crash in a couple of keystrokes, and a new one could be put in place just as fast. When "money" is an electronic hallucination, what prevents the managers of money from filling any void you care to imagine with more hallucinations? As for Russia, well, I trust you've noticed that they're still around...<br><br>Jean-Vivien, get some job skills outside the IT field. My guess is that even without economic and political decline, it's going to have many fewer jobs than seekers in the fairly near future. <br><br>Stephen, good heavens. If I didn't know you'd been reading this blog for months, I'd think you just jumped into the discussion without finding out what I actually mean by the model you dismiss so blithely. In case you need a reminder, it's a very broad and general overview of the kinds of economies likely to emerge over the next two to four centuries in the aftermath of the industrial age. Of course there will be near-infinite local variations, cyclic peaks and troughs, mass migrations, the collapse of some nations and the rise of others -- in other words, history, which (<i>pace</i> Francis Fukuyama) is still going strong. The slow and very uneven transitions from scarcity industrialism through salvage economy to the possibility -- by no means certainty -- of a future ecotechnic age is simply one broad and, I think, plausible trajectory woven into a fabric of centuries of historical change. <br><br>Jevandorp, you're leaving out the huge energy inputs needed to build, maintain, and supply automated manufacturing, and the global supply and distribution chains that make those work. As energy costs rise, those will become less and less affordable as compared to local manufacture using skilled labor. It's already cheaper for the Chinese to hire workers than it is for them to install automation; as the relative value of extrasomatic energy goes up in comparison to human labor -- a change that is already under way, and will accelerate dramatically (if unevenly) as fossil fuel reserves deplete) -- automated factories will no longer have the economic advantages they had during the age of cheap energy, and will thus end up on the scrap heap.<br><br><a href=post-petroleum-job-ads.html#c3494108502190330420 title="comment permalink">9/9/08, 2:05 PM</a><br><br>

Hardware will stay in service longer, and will be repaired rather than thrown out — better learn soldering and some bare-metal repair techniques. Fancy UIs will go away, so toss that MCSE in the composter and learn how to deal with the computer on its own terms (if you haven't already). The most critical software, once again, will be what's written in-house for the specialized needs of the users.<br><br>I also expect that, if the technical/industrial society holds together for another decade, that flash drives will replace hard drives. Expect similar power-saving measures all across the board… perhaps your company will find it doesn't need nearly as much bandwidth (and router capacity) as before, for example. There will still be IT departments, I believe, throughout your entire working life (barring some cataclysm), but your job won't be static.

Any argument to support the anti-technology premise is common-sense if you're cynical, but science is not about being cynical or relying on past performance to predict future behavior.<br><br>IMO, in a future of energy conservation, there's ample energy supply serving the current infrastructure to allow transition to alternative fuels and energy-efficient technologies before civilization declines.<br><br>However, an economist might make an economic argument about how some conditions will occur globally that reduce consumer incentive to buy mass-produced goods. In that case, communities might become self-sufficient and rely on low-power technologies as growth economies are squeezed. In those communities, capital won't flow in to create and maintain production from small factories. <br><br>For now, my lifeboats sit on dry land, but those boats will probably float on a future of satellites, supercomputers, liquid fuels, vaccines, money markets, and global networks.

The concept of trades, guilds, villages, co-ops, apprenticeships, and people living in small enough groups to have a good bit of self sufficiency. To know the people they do business with.
