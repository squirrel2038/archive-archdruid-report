One of the pitfalls that lies in the path of those who try to gauge the outlines of the future in advance, and swallows no small number of them, is the assumption that today’s popular beliefs and assumptions are a good guide to tomorrow’s. Sometimes, to be sure, this turns out to be the case, and some widespread opinion or other remains glued in place for decades or centuries – though this usually happens to opinions that most sensible people think will soon be abandoned. More often, though, there’s no belief less popular at any given time than the most firmly held convictions of the recent past.<br><br>A reminder of this landed in my inbox a few days back, in an article about a recent survey of American opinion. According to the article, only 53% of the people who responded to the survey agreed that capitalism was better than socialism; 20% thought that socialism was better, while 27% weren’t sure which way to call it. The article caused a brief flutter in the dovecotes of the Left, and a somewhat larger one in the hawk-cotes of the Right, but I’m not at all sure that either side caught the wider implications of the shift this survey documented.<br><br>Some history needs to be surveyed to make sense of those implications. Ever since the rubble stopped bouncing in 1945, what used to be called political economy – that is, the way that human societies organize and direct their economic activities – has been defined by a choice between two unpromising alternatives. Calling them simply “capitalism” and “socialism,” popular as this habit is, misstates the matter, because they were much more specific than that.<br><br>The first might better be called corporate capitalism, as it recycled older forms of capitalism in the service of the weird social fiction of the corporation, a “legal person” that has more rights and fewer responsibilities than the rest of us, and serves today’s well-to-do in roughly the same role that the image of Oz the Great and Powerful did for the little man behind the curtain. The second might with equal justice be called bureaucratic socialism, as it translated the grand promises and stirring rhetoric of generations of radicals into dour totalitarian states that guaranteed every citizen an equal share of deprivation and repression.<br><br>In retrospect, it might seem obvious that there are many other ways to run a free market economy than relying on an arrangement that Adam Smith himself considered the worst possible way to run a business. (I wonder how many of today’s cheerleaders for corporatist capitalism have read Smith’s scathing comments about joint-stock companies, the proto-corporations of his own time.) It might seem equally obvious that there are plenty of ways to manage an economy of collective ownership that do not require vast sclerotic bureaucracies governed by dogmatic ideologies. Nor are some form of free market or some form of collective ownership the only ways to manage a society’s production and distribution of goods and services.<br><br>The fact remains, though, that since 1945 nearly everyone in the industrial world, and most of the nonindustrial world as well, has behaved as though corporate capitalism, bureaucratic socialism, or some awkward hybrid such as social democracy composed of spare parts from both, were the only possible forms of political economy. This is problematic now, because both corporate capitalism and bureaucratic socialism have not only failed abjectly to make good on their promises, but have turned out to be catastrophically failure-prone into the bargain.<br><br>After the collapse of the Soviet Union and its client states, the massed failures of bureaucratic socialism are hard to miss. Still, corporate capitalism has demonstrated not once but twice that its results are just as bad. From 1896 to 1929, and then again from 1980 to 2008, corporate capitalism was allowed to take the bit in its teeth and run, and in each case the result was an accelerating cycle of disastrous booms and busts and the emergence of a culture of corporate kleptocracy that, between them, ended up devastating the global economy. Meanwhile the faith that a rising tide would lift all boats turned out, in both cases, to be completely misplaced; the benefits that were supposed to trickle down trickled up instead, beggaring the working classes and driving much of the middle class into relative poverty while funneling most of society’s wealth into the unproductive hands of speculators and financiers.<br><br>Neither system, in other words, works worth a tinker’s expletive at the basic job of keeping an economy productive and functioning, and both thus might reasonably be chucked into history’s recycle bin. The one difficulty is that very few people nowadays realize that there are other alternatives – and this, in turn, is a function of our collective blindness to our own history.<br><br>Until the Second World War, in point of fact, corporate capitalism and bureaucratic socialism were only the most successful of a dizzying range of systems of political economy that had a substantial public presence. Distributism, syndicalism, synarchism, guild socialism, and many others were discussed in a lively literature of books and periodicals, and each had its enthusiastic followers. Nor were these simply slight variations on the two systems left standing; some tended toward the free market end of the spectrum, others toward the collective ownership end, and some occupied positions in the middle, assigning some fields of economic activity to the free market while putting others in the public sphere, but each offered a distinctive system for managing the realities of human economic life.<br><br>What squeezed these alternative systems out of collective consciousness was the long era of the Cold War, when both sides turned their respective systems of political economy into ideological battle flags in the struggle over which of two empires – American or Russian – would dominate the world in the wake of the British Empire’s long retreat. (Yes, I know it’s unpopular these days to suggest that America is an empire, but given that we station troops in 140 countries just now, backing up a state of affairs in which the 5% of humanity that lives in the United States uses around a third of the world’s resources and industrial output, the term is hard to avoid.) The United States won that struggle, only to find – as every other empire in history has found – that getting to the top of the heap simply makes you target number one for an endless series of fresh challengers, one of whom will eventually win.<br><br>The disastrous narrowing of vision that was driven by the bitter rivalries of the Cold War years remains fixed in place, though, not only in the United States but – in large part due to America’s current role as the main manufacturer and exporter of the global culture industry – throughout most of the world. The problem with this state of affairs is not limited to the massive failures that afflict both corporate capitalism and bureaucratic socialism; neither system has shown the least trace of an ability to deal with the challenge of making human economics work within the fragile ecology and finite resource base of our planet, for example. Still, at a time when the world’s industrial societies are facing severe problems due to the steady depletion of fossil fuel reserves, relying on systems of political economy that have a proven track record of catastrophic dysfunction anyway is not exactly a good idea.<br><br>What the survey mentioned at the beginning of this post shows, in turn, is that a growing number of Americans have become aware of this last point. That opens up options that have been closed for the last two generations or so. Thus I’d like to offer a bit of advice to distributists – yes, there are still some out there – and proponents of any other alternative systems of political economy that may still be around after all these years: now’s your chance. If, as the survey suggests, 27% of Americans have already reached the point where neither capitalism nor socialism has any particular appeal, there’s a large audience waiting to hear what you have to say, if you make an effort to get the word out to them. <br><br>Now of course there’s also a place for newly minted alternatives, provided that those don’t start from the assumption that people can consume more goods and services than they produce, or that the Earth’s remaining resource base can support – two little difficulties that have been all too common in recent schemes of this sort. Even the most determined prophet of some new system, though, might benefit from taking a good close look at what has been done in the past; if you’re going to reinvent the wheel, it might be useful to make sure that your version is actually better than the last century or two of attempts at the same thing. Anything that can pop our collective imaginations out of the current and hopelessly sterile fixation on the relative merits of two abjectly failed systems is likely to be a good thing.<br><br>Will it be enough of a good thing to stave off the decline and fall this blog has been discussing for the last three years? At this stage of the game, with petroleum production already sliding and so many opportunities gone by the boards, that seems hopelessly unlikely. Still, the adoption of some less wildly inefficient and failure-prone approach to political economy would be a very sensible move as we begin to deal with the challenges of the long era of contraction and readjustment that is taking shape around us right now. Utopian schemes remain as useless as they have ever been, but efforts at thoughtful, constructive, and realistic change are quite another matter, and in the wake of corporate capitalism’s latest round of failure, there might just be an opportunity to accomplish a bit of the latter.

When it comes time for election it seems as though only two parties exist. Dumb and dumber, and we must choose the lesser of two dumbers. Media has its own interests but still they set the stage for "great" debates between only two candidates. Imagine if Nader, or Bob Brown in Australia were included in televised debates. And I only make reference to the Greens Party candidates. I don't know if the good vs. evil dichotomy is all that "most" people can understand or if its all that they are exposed to at any meaningful level. <br><br>It's as though, as the population grows to previously unimaginable highs, our political spectrum has narrowed to an unprecedented spike, some sort of mountain peak where there's only room for one but two want to sit and have dominion over all. <br><br>I'll be happy at the fertile base, beneath the radar and amidst the rubble of the their collapse.<br><br><a href=some-advice-for-distributists.html#c1579249958068695995 title="comment permalink">4/16/09, 12:00 AM</a><br><br>

Guy</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>I agree with your vision of the failure of these two economic schemes to take the resources of our entire planet and the personal economic activities of over six thousand million people and fit them comfy cozy under a single all encompassing ideal. It seems unfortunate to me though that the most efficient means of mass communicating any new ideas are through channels of public communication which are altogether intertwined and controlled by those ideals though perhaps less so the communications on the internet (although even that is completely moderated in some nations and becoming ever more under the control of both government and corporations in the USA). Do you believe that this will inhibit alternative ideas from gaining ground? Also it appears to me that the myth of perpetual progress, such as it is an effective governing religious ideal of this society (United States), is much like many other religions and has its books of psalms and hymns and that the sweeping chorus of Corporate Capitalism has become of late (on a historical scale) one of its most beloved and holy scriptures so that to deny the purity of it may bring down onto an individual the righteous indignation of the ones who stand as ministers, chaplains, priests, elders etc. in the great church of perpetual progress along with those individuals who may disagree with the rest of the progress bit but love that particular hymn so much that they have since split off and created their own denominations.<br><br> I have so many other paths of thought I wish earnestly to share and as you seem simply the most capable of understanding them I find myself daily wandering which thoughts would be most beneficial to communicate and ask for assistance with here so that others may see them but I am not well practiced in tending and growing minds and only somewhat experienced with one or two at a time and not entire forests.<br><br> I would like to thank you again for making your thoughts so accessible. I have nearly finished reading (and at times re-reading, re-re-reading...) the full archive here and hope that it is not a bother if I take each post and all of its comments and create a digital collection of each year's material for myself and any I can find with willing ears to share with.<br><br><a href=some-advice-for-distributists.html#c5342024625249731527 title="comment permalink">4/16/09, 5:48 AM</a><br><br>

We are so over surveyed in this country that anything will be said anything to get it over with. <br><br>The most interesting thing in the survey was the difference in generation in their response.

At this time I want to express my appreciation for your very thoughtful, and thought-provoking comments.<br>Yes, there is a better way. I can't describe it, other than I know that it I believe it must include a much better integration of personal responsibility and understanding of what it is reasonable for any person to expect with a fundamental restructuring of some of our basic social institutions. I know, sounds kind of muddy, but some time ago I formed this into my own sense of long term vision. I called it:<br><br>My Vision of a Greening World -<br>where every person...<br><br>Understands the consequences of their consumption and is actively engaged in reducing its effect.<br><br><br>Commits to the goal of consuming no more than his or her fair share.<br><br>Knows that to do otherwise will lead to tragic consequences for life as we know it.<br><br>Seeks to appreciate the quality of the life they are given more than the quantity of what they have and experience. <br><br>This is a tall order of change for humanity. Corporatist type thinking has almost drowned out any type of "seven generation" thinking as so often demonstrated by many indigenous communities.<br><br>I can readily get bogged down in sadness when I think that we really are very close to running out of time. Whether that be true or not, however, I choose light, over darkness, hope over despair. To do otherwise simply hastens our demise.<br><br>Thank you again for being a shining light in the darkness.<br><br><a href=some-advice-for-distributists.html#c569943341668981375 title="comment permalink">4/16/09, 8:34 AM</a><br><br>
<div class="avtb a_12120c" id=c1017764926393670189></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/00627270393248813976 rel=nofollow>Danby</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>John,<br>Thanks for the advice. Believe me we know. Our problem is, as it has always been, actually formulating some policies to go along with our theorizing.<br><br>For those who are interested, Distributism is the attempt to implement the social teaching of the Catholic Church as laid out by Leo XIII in Rerum Novarum and Pius XII in Quadragesimo Anno. Essentially, the Church looked at Capitalism and Socialism and determined that they both deny mankind's essential dignity, by making him into a slave of either the state or the capitalist. In modern times one can replace the word Capitalist with Corporation.<br><br>The base principle of Distributism is that productive property should be as widely distributed as possible, so that every workingman should be secure in his livelihood, and that the role of the state is to discourage the accumulation of productive capital into a small set of hands. Thus, possession of farmland, for instance, should be taxed a high rate when it exceeds the space needed to support a family in reasonable comfort. It is hoped that this would result in the breakup of those 10,000 acre California industrial food production facilities. Commercial establishments would be taxed at an accelerated rate based on the number of employees and the number of branches, opening room in the market for someone besides Appleby's and McDonald's to run a restaurant.<br><br>For industrial concerns that do not admit of an "each workman his own master" solution, such as automotive manufacture, Distributism favors the creation of and conversion to co-operative enterprises such as the Mondragon Co-operative Corporation in Spain, and the similar enterprises in Emilia-Romagna, Italy.<br><br>I am stating it very briefly here. If you would like to know more about Distributism, the websites <a href=http://distributism.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>The Distributist Review</a> and <a href=http://distributist.blogspot.com rel=nofollow> the Chesterbelloc Mandate</a> have much much more information. Did I mention that Distributists tend toward wordy theorizing? Which I suppose is understandable when your ideas have been shoved into a corner and dismissed out of hand for a century and a half. When you can't implement, you have to theorize.<br><br><a href=some-advice-for-distributists.html#c1017764926393670189 title="comment permalink">4/16/09, 9:23 AM</a><br><br>

All societies large and complex enough to need middle managers between the leader and the masses have 'bureaucracy' in some sense of the word, by what stops some bureaucracies from getting out of hand, and can that limiting factor be deliberately introduced?<br><br>I have cautious hopes for distributism, but would be interested in seeing the pros and cons of the other alternatives you mentioned discussed further.

In it he points out some simple ideas that can get a conversation started with others: If you use the standard left/right spectrum to start dividing people you end up with Noam Chomsky and Stalin together on the far left, and Ron Paul and Hitler together on the far right. Obviously that's a failed model. A better basic model would be a 2-dimensional chart with socialism and capitalism on one axis, and involuntary and voluntary on the other. Are you a involuntary socialist (N. Korea) or voluntary (community garden), a involuntary capitalist (Hitler) or a voluntary(Adam Smith)?<br><br>It seems to me many of the problems in this world are directly caused by dogmatic adherence to overly simplistic models; e.g. simplistic models can lead in part to horrific events like holocausts. And that even good models can only be interpreted through a broad knowledge base; e.g. the other day I saw a top voted article on Digg, a top social news site, with the author proclaiming because they believe in evolution theory sexual activity now provides the primary meaning to her life. If you've ever played Go, a game more complex than chess, you know that the most complex computer models can hardly beat amateurs. The game requires great strategy; and also requires great study of all the possible situations one might get into, akin to studying history. I guess my idea of model is closely related to John's myths of civilization.<br><br><a href=some-advice-for-distributists.html#c6632850715394467468 title="comment permalink">4/16/09, 10:46 AM</a><br><br>

I don't happen to know of a single site or book -- might make a good project. <br><br>Robert, most of the material that's been posted here has ended up as raw material for two books on the future of industrial society, <i>The Long Descent</i> (New Society, 2008) and <i>The Ecotechnic Future</i> (New Society, due out in September). Picking those up might be a lot less work than slogging through the archives!<br><br>Bilbo, I'd noticed the age difference as well. I'm less sure that the figures are just survey overload, though, but we'll see.<br><br>Leonard, it's a good vision. Now get out there and communicate it to the world; more people may be ready to hear it than you think. <br><br>Danby, theories and policies are less important right now than public exposure for the basic ideas. There have got to be some competent writers among today's distributists -- you, for example; write a clear readable article explaining what it's about, and get that puppy into the alternative press. (The same advice, of course, goes for any guild socialists, syndicalists, etc. who may be reading this.) You've got a window of opportunity to redefine the whole context of public discourse about political economy, might as well put it to use.<br><br>Megan, a field guide to alternative systems of political economy would be quite an undertaking; I'll consider it, though. For now I'll simply say that I'm highly prejudiced in favor of economic decentralization, cooperative modes of economic organization, and representative democracy, and any system that fosters those is probably going to get high marks in my book. <br><br>Thank you for the heads up about the Diamond article, btw! (I posted the comment because I suspect others will find it interesting as well.) I don't have a subscription with that service, and would welcome a pdf copy; please send it to creyrglas (at) earthlink (dot) org. Many thanks!<br><br>Blindweb, oversimplifying reality into two rigid categories is probably the most pervasive source of failed thinking in the modern world. One of these days I should post something about the Druid notion of ternary thinking; the basic practice is that when you encounter any classification of the world into two and only two sides (we call this a binary), think of a third option that isn't simply a compromise between them. With practice you get very good at noticing the blind spots that make binary thinking seem to make sense. Yes, you can then go on to look for a fourth, fifth, etc.!<br><br>Gregory, one of the things I didn't discuss here, but have commented on in earlier posts, is that there are whole worlds of economic exchange outside the market economy altogether. Small-scale cooperation between neighbors is part of that, and yes, it's probably hardwired into our genes -- those bands of hominids whose members cooperated with one another will have survived a lot more often than those that did not. <br><br>Professor, I'm focusing here on the idea that our collective discourse about political economy doesn't need to be stuck in the same sterile rut it's been in since 1945. Exploring unfamiliar ideas is the first step toward trying out unfamiliar possibilities. <br><br>Joel, I wish I knew of a concise source! I know about this stuff because a lot of alternative spiritual traditions in the early 20th century overlapped with these movements; some of the leading English Druids of the time, for example, were also passionate supporters of Social Credit. For starters, though, you might take a look at the Wikipedia entries on these movements -- they're not too bad at all as an introduction.<br><br><a href=some-advice-for-distributists.html#c8786141812912041132 title="comment permalink">4/16/09, 1:33 PM</a><br><br>

Any idea, then, is perceived to be a coordinate on a spectrum of Democrats and Republicans, socialists and capitalists, progressive and traditional, all stretching between Stalin, Teamsters, Chomsky and Earth First at the far-left extreme vs. Hitler and the Amish on the far right. <br><br>It’s a ridiculous model – no one believes that the religions of the world are coordinates on a Catholic-Hindu spectrum, or that being, say, Druid is just being 19 percent Catholic. But binary politics are deeply ingrained – many people only want to know which team I play for, and base all their reactions on that. <br><br>I would add that, fifty or a hundred years ago, Americans seemed to be less binary in their politics as well – multiple parties were commonplace, and their support was required for major-party candidates to succeed. <br><br>The good news is that there has been some small shift away from this – co-ops and intentional communities, working on a variety of models, have multiplied in recent years, and distributism has seen a recent revival in “crunchy conservative” circles.

I'm willing to own it. Note that I'm not saying that every ideology is worthless -- far from it. I consider the worth of a human life to be a pretty high upper bound. (Hmm, I'm hearing Joanna Macy whispering in my ear -- "what about other forms of life?").<br><br>To the extent that the two currently dominant "isms", and the hopefuls that JMG mentions, are ideologies, I'm automatically suspicious, although interested in some of them. (And note that the two dominant systems have maintained their dominance at the cost of far more than a single human life.)<br><br>That said, I too welcome the offering and promotion of any alternative system for organizing society and commerce, as long as it's offered in a constructive and pragmatic spirit, and not the kind of rigid orthodoxy that closes off useful critiques of limitations and dysfunctions of the system. I'll refer to my "rules" number 4 and 5 of last week: expect to be surprised, and learn to see your system in the context in which it's embedded.<br><br>Danby laments "... Which I suppose is understandable when your ideas have been shoved into a corner and dismissed out of hand for a century and a half. When you can't implement, you have to theorize." Actually, you can implement -- numerous intentional communities have been formed in the US and other places by folks intent on creating a community that reifies their pet theories. Some of these communities still exist, although probably not as shining examples of the founders' theories. What's left of our democracy still allows room for groups of people to experiment, and succeed or fail, such experiments can be valuable when undertaken in a learningful spirit. If the original theory doesn't survive the experiment, perhaps what emerges will be an improvement. (And if/when it comes to survival of the theory vs. survival of any of the people, see my opening statement.)<br><br>Like you, John Michael, I favor decentralization and cooperation. In that vein, I'll suggest another system for folks' consideration: Jeff Vail's "rhizome" (http://www.jeffvail.net/2007/01/what-is-rhizome.html).<br><br><a href=some-advice-for-distributists.html#c2903574990950133382 title="comment permalink">4/17/09, 10:04 PM</a><br><br>

Land is property. Nature is commodified and has no voice at the table. It seems to me that we need alternatives where the whole of the biosphere, species, landscapes and all have rights of their own. We need a shift from land ownership to land stewardship. <br><br>The discussions have been very much about what, of our current civilization, will make it through the bottleneck. In my mind, preserving biological diversity is a more important task. Maybe what is in store for humanity will cure it from its hubris. Mother Nature has the bat and will blow out of the water all our ideological constructs and all our false gods.<br><br>At this juncture of history, I dont like the idea of anybody looking at land and splitting it up according to some other political idea such as distributism. The voices who speak for chickadees, black spruces, tortoises are still too few and too marginalized. I guess I saw too many clearcut forests to believe in human-centered political agenda of any stripes. Ethical systems derived from monotheistic religions have failed miserably. They unrooted the divine from the Earth and placed in the Heavens, removing springs, trees, animals from the domain of the sacred. There is no political framework in place allowing for a balance in between human interests and the biosphere interests, its all individual judgement call for the custodian of a piece of the land. Its muddling through at the edge. And I feel that as long as population control is not at the forefront of a new ethic, it will be up to concerned individuals to defend what's left of wilderness against human depredation. The land I have temporary stewarship is not just good farmland. Its the home of many others wild creatures. I dont want it being farmed wall to wall, no matter how pressing it will become to feed the human population, sustainably, conventionally, organically or any otherways. Part of the original farm has already being sold to Duck Unlimited.<br><br><a href=some-advice-for-distributists.html#c4487495631549520789 title="comment permalink">4/20/09, 9:43 AM</a><br><br>

Not too many people pay attention to him -- which may explain why the <i>Protocols of the Elders of Zion</i>, which Cohn efficiently debunked, is once again circulating on the fringes. <br><br>Brian, I wish your idea of a Catholic-Hindu spectrum for the world's religions was a joke; I've read fundamentalist Protestant screeds that insisted that all religions other than theirs were variants of Hinduism. Sheesh. <br><br>John, of course there are other models. My point is that they're still very poorly publicized in the general alternative scene. <br><br>Archmage, I found it refreshingly easy to get a reading knowledge of German. Harder than English? Well, if you insist...<br><br>Roy, I don't doubt for a moment that there are good things being written by Distributists. The problem I'm trying to point up is that they're only being read by other Distributists, when they -- and their equivalents elsewhere on the spectrum -- need to find their way into the broader discourse about alternative systems of political economy. As long as it's just fans of the ChesterBelloc talking to one another, there's a very hard limit to what you can hope to accomplish. <br><br>Loveandlight, thanks for the links!<br><br>Crazy Mama, no argument there. The personal is always the root of the political. My hope, though, is that people can get a wider sense of the limits of the imaginable, and then start putting what they imagine into practice. <br><br>Dwig, I'd say there are ideologies that need badly enough to be stopped that some lives may be worth spending -- Nazism comes to mind. Still, you're certainly right that when any ideology tries to enforce itself by violence, it's lost its right to serious consideration. Thanks for the link to Jeff's rhizome theory!<br><br>Karel, I think you're likely right about bureaucracy. <br><br>Spotted Wolf, I think you've missed my point completely. The last thing I want is consensus, of any kind. I want people to disagree more, ask more hard questions about their basic assumptions, and come up with different answers. That's the exact equivalent of the natural diversity that makes for a healthy ecosystem. <br><br>Marielar, I have to disagree -- and please remember that I agree with you about the rights of chickadees. It's precisely because too many basic questions about economics are taken for granted that we've stumbled into the current blind consensus that takes money values as the only values worth taking into consideration.<br><br>Evan, thank you! "So 20th century" -- now there's a crushing comment. But you're quite right; the last thing we need is the replacement of one universal system with another.<br><br><a href=some-advice-for-distributists.html#c8836884751186494617 title="comment permalink">4/21/09, 12:05 AM</a><br><br>

But the media is very selective, which ideas to promote. Alternative thinkers and doers are effectively marginalized, because of little attention the media gives and even lack of communication between them. I do not quite believe that media sensationalism and the hectic life rhythm are the “natural” outcomes of survival competition. Rather, the memes of competition, consumption, “investments”, of particular political and media interests are there everywhere because they are very convenient to various elites with (quite hidden) power to persistent influence.<br><br>I am touching here the unpleasant topic of possible (emergent or actual) conspiracies. But as so much power and unconditional social status is given to money, and as financial inequalities diverge no less quickly and dramatically than in a “Monopoly” game, we ought to ask ourselves: How much power do the big money makers really have? How much do they determine the way of life and thinking? What do elite leaders really represent and discuss in G20 or Davos meetings? How much (and in which ways) do they care of crises and sufferings? How long are they possibly pushing self-serving agendas?<br><br>Economic imagination is really hollowed in the middle. It would not be surprising if that serves most powerful interests very well. There are even extreme theories (like of Antony Sutton) that already the Bolshevik revolution and Hitler were projects of some Wall Street groups. Wars had been profitable “investments” since ages.<br><br>Not only the elites are possibly disrupting development of alternative ideas. They might be smart enough to foresee coming crises (whether financial, demographic, resource depletion or climate instability) and prepare for them stealthily, or even orchestrate them. They confidence might be stemming from some private knowledge of what was really behind many important events.<br><br>Sorry to bring this up. But I increasingly see “empirical” theories of collapse or global changes as naive or suspect. Just to give one example, the break-up of Soviet Union does not look to me like a natural break-down of a failed ideology (and I remember it from pretty close). Quite obviously, the Soviet leaders gave up the project without much testing of supposed inevitabilities. And most of them re-oriented to the wild capitalism very readily. Only a few East European leaders suffered on their skin. (And by the way, the mood in East European countries now is much darker, with hardly any worthy industry or education preserved, but with large monetary obligations or dependance). <br><br>This picture of elite control is not great, but it may offer good practical expectations and guidance. First of all, governments are not to be trusted, now for real. They work well for those inside; wouldn’t you love those ridiculously fat bailouts? Whatever cooperation or self-governing people may need for carrying on, they have to manage it themselves, with some taxing and indebting load from the top.<br><br><a href=some-advice-for-distributists.html#c4664231195984413394 title="comment permalink">4/21/09, 4:54 AM</a><br><br>

That is exactly how I've always read Belloc's Distributist political analysis in "The Servile State"; "primary" and "surplus" circuits in Lonergan's monetary economics are likewise involuntary and voluntary, the one dictated by need and the other allowing democratic choice. <br><br>The difficulty is that both actual and potential Distributists have differing personalities reflecting any three of these four possibilities to the neglect of the other, with the result that, just as there are four Gospels, there are four different perspectives on what Distributism is; if any one of these dominates that represents a personality bias. Chesterton and Belloc provided complementary perspectives, but neither, like most Distributists now, had the experience of theorising and engineering necessary to be able to realise that we cannot just "exchange" a bad system for better one; one has to go through a four-phase research, development, design and "tooling up" (or more appropriately here, "programming") process. <br><br> The initial research itself has also had to go through four phases, as the realisation that Old Testament Law didn't work gave way to the revolutionary New Testament ethos of loving others. It is being tried by Hume's 1740atheistic argument against even knowing others being possible, but by 1948 Shannon had discovered "computer" logics which not only do what Hume thought impossible but are usually able to correct themselves when they go wrong. <br><br>I've been trying for years to get not just other Distributists but social scientists and philosophers of science to see the significance of these "active" and "moral" forms of logic, but as of now it does seem that commands and a superficial "good vs. evil dichotomy is all that 'most' people can understand". Such has been the effect of specialisation and the blind leading the blind.<br> <br>The reality is that the very few (perhaps just one of us) who see the whole picture will remain impotent unless rather more potential programmers realise the need to grapple with Blindweb's complex error-correcting logic of the Cross, and enthuse a good body of activists by embodying it in a Catholic programme complex enough to meet all types of need in their own due time. (As Einstein said and Blindweb has also realised, "We need to keep it simple, but not too simple).<br><br>Only then will the "higher education" and legal work get done to make it possible for us all to do what most of us want to: replace the "tramlines to hell" of the present system with a Distributist freedom to drive safely in our own economic car. <br><br>God has worked miracles in getting us this far, for which we thank him as we pray "deliver us from evil".
