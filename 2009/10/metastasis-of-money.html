The confusion between money and wealth, the theme of last week’s <i>Archdruid Report</i> post, has become almost impossible to avoid these days. Perhaps the most important reason is the extent to which money has metastasized so deeply into our economic life that it’s nearly impossible to do much of anything without it.<br><br>The economic textbooks you did your best not to read in school justify that ubiquity by a neat rhetorical trick. If you remember anything at all about the economics textbook you did your level best not to read back in your school days, it’s probably that bit of rhetoric; it can be found in the canned explanation for why we use money, somewhere around page 6. It runs something like this: there’s a plumber and a pig farmer who want to do business with one another, see, but the plumber’s Jewish and the pig farmer has nothing to trade but pork. Add money, and voila! The farmer sells his pork to other people and uses the proceeds to pay the plumber, who uses it to buy gefilte fish and matzoh meal. Everyone’s happy except, presumably, the pigs.<br><br>It all seems very logical until you think about it for ten seconds. Notice, to start with, how the explanation assumes that the plumber, the pig farmer, the purchasers of pork, the kosher deli, and everyone else are restricted to the specific kind of economic relationships that exist in, and only in, a money economy. The plumber doesn’t, as most people did as little as a hundred and fifty years ago, benefit from a household economy that provides a great deal of his food, including small livestock in the back garden. The pig farmer doesn’t, as most people did until as little as fifty years ago, do essentially all of his household repairs himself. Both of them are defined by a single function: the pig farmer can only produce pork, the plumber only plumbing.<br><br>Nor do the farmer, the plumber, or anyone else have access to any of the immense variety of nonmonetary systems of exchange human beings have used throughout history. !Kung hunter-gatherers sharing out a wildebeest among band members according to traditional rules, Haida chiefs distributing blankets and salmon to all comers at a potlatch, and medieval peasants working a baron’s demesne lands for a set number of days each year to maintain their feudal right to their own cottages and fields, all participated in flexible and effective systems of exchange that had nothing to do with money. Urban societies as complex as ancient Egypt got by entirely without money, and still managed to keep plumbers, pig farmers, and a great many other occupational specialties gainfully employed for millennia.<br><br>All that the textbook explanation proves, in other words, is that if you have a money economy, it does probably need some kind of money to make it work. This is not the conclusion the textbooks draw from the plumber and the pig farmer, of course; with very few exceptions, they leap from their canned example to the claim that money must be essential to any economy worth the name, and the rest of the textbook proceeds to focus on theories about the behavior of money under the false impression that those theories deal with the behavior of wealth.<br><br>The mistaken metaphysics discussed in last week’s post plays a large role in fostering this misunderstanding, but the sheer pervasiveness of money in today’s industrial economy has an even larger role. For most people in the modern industrial world, the only way to get access to any kind of wealth – that is, any good or service – is to get access to money first, and exchange the money for the wealth. This makes it all too easy to confuse money with wealth, and it also fosters the habit of thought that treats money as the driving force in economic life, and thinks of wealth as a product of money, rather than seeing money as an arbitrary measure of wealth.<br><br>The thought experiment of placing a hundred economists on a desert island with $1 million each but no food or water is a good corrective to this delusion. Unfortunately this same experiment is being tried on a much vaster scale by the world’s industrial economies right now. We have seven billion people on a planet with a finite and dwindling supply of the concentrated energy resources that are keeping most of them alive, and governments and businesses alike are acting as though the only possible difficulty in this situation is coming up with enough money to pay for investments in the energy industry.<br><br>It should be obvious that no amount of money can overcome the thermodynamic and statistical laws that have placed hard limits on the amount of highly concentrated energy resources that happen to exist on our planet. This is not obvious to most people nowadays, however, because the metastasis of money throughout the economy has trained nearly all of us to think that if you have enough money you can get whatever you want. The fact that the richest people in the world can put their entire fortunes into health care and still get old and die is one of the few persistent reminders that money cannot overcome the laws of nature, or provide access to goods and services that don’t exist.<br><br>So how did money get transformed from a convenient yardstick for real wealth to the be-all and end-all of contemporary economic life? At least three factors were involved, two of them common to complex urban societies throughout history, one unique to ours.<br><br>First, despite the drastic oversimplifications of the textbook example cited earlier, it reflects a reality: a complex society can gain significant advantages from a medium of exchange that can be traded for any form of wealth. Even in societies where most goods and services are distributed by way of social networks, a social consensus tends to establish certain trade goods – wampum shell strings among the First Nations of eastern North America, for instance – as a common measure for those goods and services that are exchanged in other ways. As a society becomes more complex and the division of labor among different crafts expands, some standard measure of wealth becomes more useful. While money itself was invented around 700 BCE by the ancient Greeks, other ways of measuring wealth for the sake of easy exchange had been in use in Old World urban societies for millennia before then, and it’s not inaccurate to include money or some equivalent system as part of the basic toolkit that makes complex urban societies possible.<br><br>Second, whenever common measures of wealth are controlled by institutions, those who manage those institutions become powerful, and can be counted on to maintain and expand their power whenever possible. In ancient Egypt, for example, grain in temple warehouses provided the basic measure of wealth; as a result the priests who controlled the stockpiled grain became a potent political force. In medieval Europe, when land was the basic measure of wealth – there’s a reason we still call it “real estate,” as though all other wealth is unreal – the power of the feudal nobility derived directly from their control of land. Today the governments that claim exclusive power to print and regulate money, and the banks and financial corporations that manage most of society’s money, derive much of their effective power from their control over the medium of economic exchange, and can be counted on to encourage the rest of society to rely ever more completely on the thing that gives them power.<br><br>These two factors can be traced in the history of most of the complex urban societies of the past. What makes our civilization something of an extreme case is a third factor – the extreme complexity of an economic system that has temporarily replaced the limited energy resources of other human societies with a torrent of cheap and abundant energy from fossil fuels.<br><br>Ilya Prigogine, one of the most innovative physicists of recent years, showed via a series of dizzyingly complex equations that the flow of energy through a system increases the complexity of the system. If there was ever any doubt of the accuracy of his claim, it was settled by the economic history of the western world from 1700 to the present. The societies over which the tsunami of the Industrial Revolution broke in the early 18th century were not unusually complex by the standards of past civilizations; their own contemporaries in the Chinese and Ottoman Empires considered western Europeans, and not without reason, to be grunting, smelly barbarians with few of the arts and graces of civilization.<br><br>Fossil fuels may not have done anything about the gracelessness and the smell, but it certainly made up for any shortage in complexity. Until the dawn of the industrial age, as a general rule of thumb, some 90% of the inhabitants of any complex society worked in agriculture, providing the food and raw materials that supported themselves as well as the 10% who could be spared for all other economic roles. By 1900, at the zenith of the age of coal, many nations in the industrial world had dropped the percentage of their work force in agriculture below 50%, and shifted the workers thus freed up into a broad assortment of new economic roles. By 2000, buoyed by the much higher concentration and efficiency of petroleum, many industrial nations had dropped the percentage of their work force in agriculture below 5%, with the other 95% filling newly invented roles in the most complex economies in the history of the planet.<br><br>One consequence of this swift and unprecedented surge in complexity was the triumph of money over all other systems of exchange. When the vast majority of workers at every income level labored at tasks so specialized that their efforts only produced value when combined with those of hundreds or thousands of other workers, money provided the only way they could receive a return on their labor. When most of the customers for any given product had money and nothing else to exchange for it, buying products for money became standard. Social networks of exchange – household economies, customary local exchanges, church and fraternal networks– shattered under the strain, and were replaced by purely economic relationships – wage labor, shopping, public assistance – that could be denominated entirely in cash. The last three centuries of social and economic history are largely a chronicle of the results. <br><br>If economists took a wider view of the history of their discipline than they generally do, they might have noticed that what most of them consider a fundamental feature of all economies worth studying – the centrality of money – is actually a unique feature of an economic era defined by cheap abundant energy. Since the fossil fuels that made that era possible are being extracted at a pace many times the rate at which new supplies are being discovered, current assumptions about the role of money in society may be in for a series of unexpected revisions.<br><br>In an ironic way, this process of revision may be fostered by the antics of the world’s industrial nations as they try to forestall the Great Recession by spending money they don’t have. The economic crisis that gripped the world in 2008 was primarily driven by a drastic mismatch between money and wealth. When the price of a rundown suburban house zoomed from $75,000 to $575,000, for example, the change marked a distortion in the yardstick rather than any actual increase in the wealth being measured. That distortion caused every economic decision based on it – for example, a buyer’s willingness to go over his head into debt to buy the house, or a bank’s willingness to lend money on the basis of imaginary equity – to suffer similar distortions. Now that the yardsticks have snapped back to something like their proper length, the results of the distortion have to be cleared out of the economy if the amount of money in the system is once again to reflect the actual amount of wealth.<br><br>Yet this is exactly what governments and businesses are doing their level best to forestall. Governments are scrambling to prop up economic activity at a pace the real wealth of their societies can no longer support; banks and businesses are doing everything in their power to divert attention from the fact that a great many of the financial assets propping up their balance sheets were never worth anything in the first place and now, if possible, are worth even less. Both are doing so by the simple expedient of spending money they don’t have. As government deficits worldwide spin out of control and the total notional value of the world’s derivatives market climbs steadily above one quadrillion dollars, the decoupling of money from wealth is even more extreme than it was at the height of the real estate bubble.<br><br>This is another context in which a wider view of history than economists usually allow themselves to take could offer a useful warning. The dominance of money in complex societies has a distinctive trajectory over time, and next week’s post will discuss some of the ways in which that trajectory might unfold in the decades immediately before us.

What have I been investing in, and why? I'm still thinking about it and re-evaluating how I see money. We really have, as a society, mistaken money for wealth.<br><br>Wealth is so much more than money. Wealth is the sum total of real assets: having skills that add to society; engaging in mutually supportive personal and business relationships with others; the ability to enjoy life; and having a few useful possessions, and some money. Money is a part of life, but making its acquisition one's primary life goal actually leaves one in a precarious position - as money can't substitute for the other real assets. And also because - as you've noted in your post - money is more tied to the availability and supply of natural resources than most of us care to think about.<br><br><a href=metastasis-of-money.html#c4837192268178187941 title="comment permalink">10/7/09, 8:32 PM</a><br><br>

I would only quibble on your point about putting 100 economists on a desert island with a $million each. Don't you think there would be more marginal utility if we put a million economists on a desert island with $100 each? <br><br>One of the effects of the fossil fuel (FF) age we are just beginning to exit is that the population explosion tracks FF use almost exactly. As we are at 7 billion souls with a dead aim on 9 + billion we have already overshoot that connection. That is because the population growth mechanics play out over a much longer time than FF depletion. <br><br>Another poster last week mentioned that China would achieve sustainability with its one child policy. That policy was implemented in 1979. However, from 1969 until 2005 China's population almost doubled up from 800,000 + to 1.3 almost 1.4 billion. As the population continues to grow it will reach a doubling within no more than 10 years. Moreover their ecological footprint is even outstripping that as they race into the industrial/technological age. <br><br>In the past few decades entertainment has been one of the few profitable exports of the United State's. No place in the world has been unaffected by the vision of the good life as portrayed by Hollywood dreams.

I recall years ago listening to a five part radio series on the economic and philosophical thought of the economic historian Karl Polanyi. The series was entitled Markets and Society. Though Karl Polanyi was not framing his arguments in a strictly ecological sense he sure was very close. His idea of "fictitious commodities" is an example of this: land, labour, and money were in his view fictitious commodities. These things by definition can not be bought and sold in a market, the result of doing so would tear the fabric of society and turn the world into a waste land in his view. I would have to agree with his analysis. Some of your thoughts mesh well with Polanyi's; however Polanyi had a utopian view of humanities potential. I view I have discarded over the years. His views on the effects of technology on the human condition were prescient,as he put it "...helpless millions depend hourly for water, light and peace on a switch in an unknown hand. A nameless and shapeless fear makes them insist on the need for limitless power in society."<br><br><a href=metastasis-of-money.html#c7101886562105505111 title="comment permalink">10/8/09, 11:02 PM</a><br><br>

I will try and keep this post on topic but I guess it touches more on the general themes touched on in this blog.<br><br>I work for a regional government in Australia and have some marginal involvement in public policy development. Since becoming aware of peak oil I have tried to have the issue considered by policymakers but to no avail. <br><br>While I am not familiar with Ilya Prigogine referenced in this post, the centrality of energy to the economy and the consequences that shortages lead to, seems compellingly made by yourself and others such as Tainter/Hirsch/Diamond etc. Given you need energy to make stuff a decline in energy must lead long term to economic decline. And this issue cant be taken in isolation, energy scarcity interacts with a range of other problems, for us most notably arable land and water, making those problems even worse.<br><br>Sounds defeatist but try as I might there is nothing I can do within the confines of the current system/structures of power to get any traction, a looming catastrophe will unfold, which, while it could not be prevented, could have been ameliorated. Anything 'controversial' like contingency planning just doesn't enter the discourse. Even from a risk management point of view, you would think the issue warrants serious consideration. The IEA, the very agency we as a government pay to advise on these issues sends out as clear a message as possible things need to change. Nothing, doing. They're still planning for economic growth, developing idiotic plans with no chance of success and no doubt when I flag the centrality of energy to the success of any strategy they look at me as a madman. Diamond discussed this in detail in Collapse where elites refuse to make changes to adapt to changing circumstances. Being witness to this ultimately self-defeating behaviour I don't understand the wilful arrogance. The economist mentality oft discussed on this blog reigns supreme.<br><br>The only issue I could raise on this post here from my perspective is yes, the government is trying to keep things going (but not in a way which will work) but they are only giving the people what they want. I can forsee endless bailouts of no longer viable industries and even greater government spending on health and education, which in a shrinking pie has to come at the expense of government spending which doesn't generate votes ie on maintainence of our basic infrastucture eg rail and water. Through business as usual it seems likely we will kick away the ladder we need for long term viability. Nobody is willing to make any sacrifice whatsoever. And when the current government change because they cant deliver on undeliverable promises of job creation,nothing will change as the new lot will make all the same promises. All leading to an erosion in the legitimacy of the state.<br><br><a href=metastasis-of-money.html#c4261536750661678475 title="comment permalink">10/9/09, 5:55 AM</a><br><br>

What an intriguing response! Someday could you elaborate? I look at energy flows and think about how much they explain that has seemed mysterious to me. I remember when we used to discuss such things seriously and speculate about the relationship between the economic "substructure" and the political "superstructure" and how quantitative changes lead suddenly to qualitative changes. These words have been so associated with Marxism that they make people tune out - me included. Over the years I have thought that socialism was, if anything, more destructive and wasteful of resources than capitalism and that union leaders were as corrupt and voracious as corporate leaders - only with less opportunity. So now we see the concentration of capital taking place and most of humanity headed for extreme poverty but because the substructure is really energy flow what will happen?

First is that you can still have manias without fossil fuel input (ie. the tulip mania), but having an input as powerful as essentially free energy certainly helps. Second is that you omitted the economic trend after industrialization. Post industrial societies trade their manufacturing base for a service sector and certainly the most lucrative service sector is finance. Finance is best served by resources, people, markets and environments that can be exploited which is why it was so successful under colonialism. Once it begins to prey on these things within its own domain however, it begins to rot the very environment in which it operates. This is what is happening in the US at this time.<br><br><a href=metastasis-of-money.html#c2055356793017455501 title="comment permalink">10/10/09, 8:10 PM</a><br><br>

I'll look him up. <br><br>Ajmacey, this matches what I've heard from people elsewhere in local governments; even those that are willing to dabble in planning for the end of cheap energy aren't willing to put the plans into action -- one of the reasons I have my doubts about the Transition Town movement. One point you make that I think a lot of people miss is that local governments do this because their constituencies demand it; if they tried to do anything else, they'd be chucked out of office the way Jimmy Carter was. <br><br>Jane, right now you're wealthier than most millionaires. Don't let anybody talk you into trading away that wealth for a bunch of soon to be worthless paper. <br><br>Rimu, my thoughts exactly. <br><br>Lynn, my point is simply that deterministic explanations aren't always wrong. White's Law, for example, points out that economic development is directly correlated with energy per capita, so if you know the energy use per capita in a society, you also know within a fairly narrow window what their maximum level of economic development will be. It's thus entirely reasonable to say that the per capita energy use determines the level of development. It doesn't determine the form of development -- that's a much more complex thing, negotiated between people and the environment -- but it does rule out those forms of development that require a higher level of energy per capita than the culture has available. <br><br>Patz, thanks for the link!<br><br>Secondera, granted, you can have manias without fossil fuels, although you'll notice that they didn't get started in Europe until colonial ventures flooded European capitals with huge amounts of essentially free money. (Holland was a major colonial power at the time of the great tulip mania, for example.) <br><br>As for "post-industrial" economics, though, those don't exist yet. Ours is still an industrial economy, it's just one that has moved its company towns a little further away from the main population centers than they used to be. Finance was just as big a part of the economy, and just as dishonest, in the late 19th century when the US ran its factories at home. Look up the history of late 19th century financial panics and swindles in the US sometime; with the absence of computer trading and other silicon-based trickery, every bit of current fiscal chicanery had its exact equivalent back then.<br><br><a href=metastasis-of-money.html#c1774740021183032009 title="comment permalink">10/10/09, 8:52 PM</a><br><br>

I especially like how the last two posts built up to this one. Those last two got me thinking about why so many people confuse money and value, and I came to the same conclusion you did--that most people have no means other than money for acquiring goods and services. <br><br>This led me to meditate on how most of these people acquire money, and the interpersonal power dynamics involved. If a person can't (or believes he can't) get the things he needs without money, and he can't get money (or believes he can't) without a job, then that person's survival depends on his ability to convince someone else to employ him. Of course, there are all sorts of opportunities for people to be self-employed, but our schools don't train young people to be entrepreneurs or venture capitalists. They teach them to be employees. Our money-industrial economy, then, has created an artificial ecology where "survival of the fittest" means "survival of the most compliant." Based on this, it could be rationalized that discriminatory hiring practices are a form of genocide, cutting off the means of survival to a segment of the population by shutting them out of jobs.<br><br>I wrote a journal entry about it here: http://gigglingwizard.livejournal.com/569687.html<br><br>You rightly point out that people fairly recently used to produce much of their own food and did their own household repairs. One of the greatest challenges I see in helping people break free of the money=wealth mentality is helping them overcome their learned helplessness. 4-H, gardening clubs, canning parties, and all sorts of DIY activities exist for those who are already interested, but too many people just don't look into such things in the first place because they assume they would be hopelessly inept.

You can read this several ways. One is that the value of services has increased while activity in both manufacturing and services has remained roughly the same. Another is that the assignment of activities which previously didn’t exist has put greater emphasis on services over manufacturing. And finally, barring totally bogus data, the last is that the data reflects what has actually happened. Nothing is this digital and some mix of these can be happening simultaneously but having worked in the manufacturing sector for over 15 years, I feel confident that the last possibility is strongly represented in this mix.<br><br>I understand that while manufacturing at home has declined, manufacturing abroad has increased. Economies are still largely national affairs and so beginning with the UK, then Europe, the US and Canada and most recently Japan, these economies have all undergone this transition, but available data also indicates this trend towards the service sector is happening world wide.<br><br>I believe that dwindling resources, with fossil fuels leading the way, will reverse this trend. I actually think that the agricultural sector will begin to grow first with the manufacturing sector following because, among other reasons, while you can site manufacturing centers to improve efficiencies, you can’t do that with agriculture.

I suspect the Low Countries' place well to one end of the bell-shaped curve may be misleading you here.<br><br>Raven, you're welcome! It's not necessary to stop using money to get out from under the spell that makes people think it's the same thing as wealth; just treat it as a tool, and remember that its only value is the willingness of other people to take it in exchange. <br><br>Secondera, I don't doubt that there are a lot of services in the global economy these days; to some extent, it's what had to happen to provide jobs to workers surplused by automation. Even so, the manufacture of goods remains the core of the real economy; as you suggest, and I think you're quite right, most of the services are disposable in a pinch, much more so than goods. <br><br>Part, I'll certainly check him out. <br><br>Lance, one can only hope. <br><br>Tony, now that's interesting. I hadn't encountered that -- and in fact Lewis Mumford, whose work on the origins of industrialism has influenced me quite a bit, seems to have missed the role of peat entirely.

(I'd put it around 1700.) Of course monetization and increased economic complexity precede that date; they're standard features of agrarian civilizations, after all (Rome managed a great deal of both). It's just that in societies without fossil fuels, you can't take either one as far -- another point I believe I made in my post.<br><br><a href=metastasis-of-money.html#c1910931901907117496 title="comment permalink">10/14/09, 6:48 AM</a><br><br>
