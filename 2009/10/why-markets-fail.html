It’s a safe bet that any public comment on the politics of peak oil, unless it sticks closely to one of a very few widely accepted opinions, will provide a good demonstration of the laws of thermodynamics by turning plenty of energy into waste heat. Last week’s <i>Archdruid Report</i> post was no exception. Between those who thought I was too hard on Cuba, those who thought I was too soft on Cuba, those who insisted America is already a fascist dictatorship, those who thought America would be better off as a fascist dictatorship, and a variety of less classifiable rants, I was well and truly denounced. My favorite for the week was a bit of online splutter that, having exhausted its author’s apparently limited vocabulary of profanity, wound up with the nastiest term he knew: “...you <i>American</i>!”<br><br>Those of my readers with a taste for wry humor may well have found all this as entertaining as I did. Still, this week’s essay will leave such amusements behind, and return to the theme I’ve been developing in recent posts, the reinvention of economics that will be necessary in an age of hard ecological limits and deindustrial decline. Vegetarians and animal rights activists take note: a certain number of sacred cows will have to be slaughtered and dissected in the course of that inquiry, and the process is unlikely to be either painless or clean.<br><br>Of the sanctified cattle facing a gruesome fate in the years ahead of us, perhaps the most important is that blue-ribbon heifer of modern economics, the belief in the infallibility of free markets. Back in 1776, Adam Smith’s <i>The Wealth of Nations</i> popularized the idea that free market exchanges offered a more efficient way of managing economic activity than custom or government regulation. The popularity of his arguments has waxed and waned over the years; it may come as no surprise that periods of general prosperity have seen the market’s alleged wisdom proclaimed to the skies, while periods of contraction have had the reverse effect.<br><br>The economic orthodoxy that has been welded in place in the western world since the 1950s, neoclassical economics, made a nuanced version of Smith’s theory central to its theories, arguing that aside from certain exceptions much discussed in the technical literature, people making rational decisions to maximize benefits to themselves will simultaneously maximize the benefits to everyone. The neoclassical synthesis has its virtues; you won’t find neoclassical economists claiming, as the free market fundamentalists of the Austrian school so often do, that the market is always right, even when its vagaries cause catastrophic human suffering. The concept of market failure is part of the neoclassical vocabulary, and some useful work has been done under the neoclassical umbrella to explain how it is that markets can fail to respond to crucial human needs, as they routinely do.<br><br>Still, the great problem with neoclassical economics is the one has already been discussed in these posts: its models have consistently failed to foresee devastating economic disasters that many people outside the economics profession could readily and accurately predict years in advance. The implosion of the world economy in 2008 is only the most recent case in point. One writer who surveyed the economics field in the aftermath of the crash noted with some asperity that fewer than two dozen economists anywhere in the world warned in advance of the gargantuan bubble of securitized debt that exploded that year. <br><br>On the contrary, economists by the score lined up during the bubble years to insist that the giddy financial innovations of the previous decade had banished risk from the market and prosperity was assured into the foreseeable future. They were of course quite wrong, and their failure to see disaster as it loomed up in front of them compares very poorly with the large number of people who used historical parallels to recognize what was happening and make uncomfortably precise forecasts of the results. (Keith Brand, who ran the lively HousingPanic blog straight through the bubble, memorably summarized those predictions: “Dear God, this is going to end so badly.”)<br><br>I have discussed in several earlier posts some of the reasons why the entire economics profession has been so prone to miss the obvious in such cases. Here, though, I want to focus on a reason for failure that’s specific to neoclassical economics. Since most of the economists who provide advice to governments come out of the neoclassical mainstream, this is hardly irrelevant to our prospects for the future, especially – as I intend to show – because the same blind spot that left so many pundits dining on a banquet of crow in recent months applies with even greater force to the crucial fact of our time, the arrival of peak oil.<br><br>The point I want to make here is a little different from the most common critique of neoclassical economics, though there is a connection. Many social critics have commented on the ease with which the neoclassical synthesis consistently ignores the interface between economic wealth and power. Even when people rationally seek to maximize benefits to themselves, after all, their options for doing so are very often tightly constrained by economic systems that have been manipulated to maximize the benefits going to someone else. <br><br>This is a pervasive problem in most human societies, and it’s worth noting that those societies that survive over the long term tend to be the ones that work out ways to keep too much wealth from piling up uselessly in the hands of those with more power than others. This is why hunter-gatherers have customary rules for sharing out the meat from a large kill, why chieftains in so many tribal societies maintain their positions of influence by lavish generosity, and why those nations that got through the last Great Depression intact did so by imposing sensible checks and balances on concentrated wealth – though most of those checks and balances in the United States were scrapped several decades ago, with utterly predictable results.<br><br>By neglecting and even arguing against these necessary redistributive processes, neoclassical economics has helped feed economic disparities, and these in turn have played a major role in driving cycles of boom and bust. It’s no accident that the most devastating speculative bubbles happen in places and times when the distribution of wealth is unusually lopsided, as it was in America, for example, in the 1920s and the period from 1990 to 2008. The connection here is simple: when wealth is widely distributed, more of it circulates in the productive economy of wages and consumer purchases; when wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few, more of it moves into the investment economy where the well-to-do keep their wealth, and a buildup of capital in the investment economy is one of the necessary preconditions for a speculative binge.<br><br>More broadly, concentrations of wealth can be cashed in for political influence, and political influence can be used to limit the economic choices available to others. Individuals can and do rationally choose to maximize the benefits available to them by exercising influence in this way, but the results can impose destructive inefficiencies on the whole economy. In effect, political manipulation of the economy by the rich for private gain does an end run around normal economic processes by way of the world of politics; what starts in the economic sphere, as a concentration of wealth, and ends there, as a distortion of the economic opportunities available to others, ducks through the political sphere in between.<br><br>A similar end run drives speculative bubbles, although here the noneconomic sphere involved is that of crowd psychology rather than politics. Very often, the choices made by participants in a bubble are not rational decisions that weigh costs against benefits; it’s not accidental that the first, and still one of the best, analyses of speculative binges and panics is titled <i>Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds</i>. Here again, a speculative bubble starts in the economic sphere, as a buildup of excessive wealth in the hands of investors, which drives the price of some favored class of assets out of its normal relationship with the rest of the economy, and it ends in the economic sphere, with the crater left by the assets in question as their price plunges roughly as far below the mean as it rose above it, dragging the rest of the economy with it. It’s the middle of the trajectory that passes through a particular form of crowd psychology, and since this is outside the economic sphere, neoclassical economics can’t deal with it.<br><br>This would be no problem if neoclassical economists by and large recognized these limitations. Unfortunately a great many of them do not, and the result is the classic type of myopia in which theory trumps reality. Since neoclassical theory claims that economic decisions are made by individuals acting freely and rationally to maximize the benefits accruing to them, it’s seemingly all too easy for economists to believe that any economic decision, no matter how harshly constrained by political power or wildly distorted by the delusional psychology of a bubble in full roar, must be a free and rational decision that will allow individuals to maximize their own benefits and benefit society as a whole. <br><br>Now of course, as mentioned in an earlier post, those who practice this sort of purblind thinking often find it very lucrative to do so. Economists who urged more free trade on the Third World at a time when “free trade” distorted by inequalities of power between nations was beggaring the Third World, like economists who urged people to buy houses at a time when houses were preposterously overpriced and facing an imminent price collapse, not uncommonly prospered by giving such appallingly bad advice. Still, it seems unreasonable to claim that all economists are motivated by greed, when the potent force of a fundamentally flawed economic paradigm also pushes them in the same direction.<br><br>That same pressure, with the same financial incentives to back it up, also drives the equally bad advice so many neoclassical economists are offering governments and businesses about the future of fossil fuels. The geological and thermodynamic limits to energy growth, like political power and the mob psychology of bubbles, lie outside the economic sphere. The interaction of economic processes with energy resources creates another end run: extraction of fossil fuels to run the world’s economies, an economic process, drives the depletion of oil and other fossil fuel reserves, a noneconomic process, and this promises to flow back into the economic sphere in the extended downward spiral of contraction and impoverishment I’ve called the Long Descent.<br><br>Here again, neoclassical economics is poorly equipped to deal with the reality of noneconomic constraints on economic processes. It thus comes as no surprise that when an economist enters the peak oil debate, it is almost always to claim that there is nothing to worry about, because the market will solve any shortfall that happens to emerge. As shortfalls emerge, expect to hear the claim – already floated by a few economists – that declining production is simply a sign that the demand for fossil fuel energy has decreased. No doubt when people are starving in the streets, we will hear claims that this is simply because the demand for food has dropped.<br><br>There are promising signs that the grip of neoclassical theory on modern economics is beginning to weaken. A recent conference on biophysical economics – a field which embraces the heretical concept that the laws of nature trump the laws of money – attracted many attendees and, in a shift of nearly seismic proportions, managed to get coverage in the New York Times. Other alternative viewpoints in economics are beginning to be heard, as they usually are in times of financial woe. Still, what’s needed now is something even more sweeping: an economics of whole systems, perhaps modeled on ecology, in which the entire world of noneconomic factors that influence economic processes is explicitly included in theories and practical analyses. Until that emerges, the advice governments and businesses receive from their paid economists may well continue to make matters worse rather than better.

In other words, might it not be that the desire for "progress", material advancement, and ever-higher living standards is the basic starting point, and the economic and even political theories are created to help support that? <br>I know this idea isn't incredibly profound, but if there's some truth to it, how useful will these new biophysical economic theories really be?<br>Furthermore, how much influence have theories, whether scientific or economic or political, ever had on the course of society? This is an open question, and I know they have had profound effects. Neoclassical economics helped to add legitimacy to our current unsustainable system. However, I believe that an equally unsustainable system would have done a fine job of mucking things up, whatever the ideological basis. Marxism, for example, looked forward to a world with just as much endless, unsustainable material advancement.<br><br>Might the problem be more profound than economics, and rooted in the very inner soul of humanity?<br><br>I do, however, think that work like yours and all the other theorists of peak oil will help to prepare individuals and communities, but I am pessimistic about the chances of larger social units. I don't think it is possible to steer them away from the shoals of peak oil, probable climate change, and overpopulation in general. Is the best that we can hope for the successful survival, with much struggle, of islands or archipelagos of humane societies that attempt to live within limits (while trying to preserve some of our cultural heritage)?<br>The Titanic is going down. Perhaps the question is simply how many lifeboats can be built, and what their destinations might be.<br>To be more brutally honest, I think that abstract scientific theories almost always are developed to the point where they are destructive for human and humane living, because abstraction inevitably excludes much of what makes life worth living, and therefore devalues it, neglects it, or even actively seeks to suppress, control, and annihilate it. Think designer babies and gray goo. Those who pursue such technological feats have drunk the kool-aid. <br>Let's hope they run out of energy for their labs and computer models before it's too late.<br><br><a href=#c2424011092910204012 title="comment permalink">10/28/09, 8:27 PM</a><br><br>

The central executive group was not doing such a good job of forecasting how much one division would require of each sort of component, which got sent over to the supplying division as a production goal. Too many shortages or surpluses cut into profits.<br><br>So the new method was to establish a market. The divisions would negotiate prices and quantities among themselves. <br><br>Whether or not it worked for that huge corporation, it helped me to see that money is just a group decision making tool. One way to think about the problem to be solved is: society maintains lots of processes, each of which takes in one collection of commodities and then generates a new collection. E.g. a screw factory takes in so many feet of steel rod and generates so many boxes of screws. Each of these processes can be run at a variety of different rates - e.g. one can build more screw factories or shut some existing ones down. So the puzzle is: what rates should all these processes be run at?<br><br>The basic goal is to keep people thriving as efficiently as possible, i.e. without a lot of waste. <br><br>There are classical algorithms for solving such problems, such as linear programming or non-linear optimization. One big problem with any kind of up-front planning is that all kinds of unknowable factors interfere with the various processes - maybe a flood shuts down a screw factory and which creates a screw shortage so the furniture factory can't meet its production goals etc. So what is really required is some kind of on-going control system to keep adjusting the various rates in response to changing conditions. <br><br>There are lots of problems with centralized control systems. For example, the control system itself is just another social process subject to breakdown etc. What has been observed across many types of systems is that a distributed control system is much more robust.<br><br>That's what markets are, a distributed control system. And money is just a language for communication within and between markets. The control system doesn't change the underlying problem of efficiency and effectiveness of possible rates of various processes maintained by society. One control system might do a better job of picking better solutions to the puzzle, but the set of possible solutions is not a function of the control system.<br><br><a href=#c1964752811553769825 title="comment permalink">10/29/09, 6:11 AM</a><br><br>

<div class="avt a_b6373a" id=c4928267621125939545></div><b><a href=http://openid.aol.com/RudolfC rel=nofollow>RudolfC</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>"It seems unreasonable to claim that all economists are motivated by greed." Well, let's call it rationally deciding to maximize their benefit. - i.e. if they believe their own theory then motivation by greed is in fact a good.<br>Two asides, if you don't mind...<br><br>First, I speculate now and then that the "science" of economics is just an attempt to justify to a sceptical Catholic Church and the civilization it influenced that lending money at interest ("usury") is not an evil. From there, the gospel (sorry) of eternal growth directly follows, as the economy then MUST grow by at least the amount of interest payments if it is not to collapse.<br><br>Second, it's interesting that in many fields the era of greatest success coincides with the era of greatest government regulation.

You're quite right about the potential for problems with higher education -- when the mind feeds solely on its own productions, things can get very weird. <br><br>Publius, of course you're right that theories -- in economics as in any other field -- draw much of their momentum from wider patterns in culture. Spengler, who explored this in quite a bit of depth, pointed out that the core metaphors of Faustian (i.e., modern western) culture can be traced in everything from our music to our bookkeeping. These wider patterns aren't graven in stone, though; sometimes they shift, and opportunities for change emerge. That doesn't mean our society is going to suddenly change course and land in Utopia, as so many people argue these days; it does mean that those who are willing to look at the world in alternative ways may be able to craft intellectual tools to enable themselves and their communities to weather the approaching storm with a little more grace. <br><br>Gene, by all means look 'em up -- there's some very useful work being done by that movement. <br><br>Peter, thank you. <br><br>Jim, well put. Markets are social technologies for accomplishing certain ends; like any other tool, they do some things very well, and others very poorly. It's the uncritical worship of the market, and the insistence that markets can do things they've consistently failed to do, rather than markets themselves, that I mean to critique here.<br><br><a href=#c336293157487045085 title="comment permalink">10/29/09, 7:08 AM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c208617598771836388></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/04737693388485635100 rel=nofollow>John Michael Greer</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Half Empty, thank you! And thank you for the link to Mobus' work -- serious stuff, and well worth reading. <br><br>Rudolf, I see the religious ban on usury -- which also exists in Islam, and was also once part of Jewish law (but only applied to Jews) -- as something akin to the Glass-Steagall Act and the other New Deal financial regulations that emerged from the rubble of the 1929 crash. The late Roman world had its own ghastly problems with bankers -- they called them "moneylenders" back then, but the principle was the same -- and the institutions that survived that age drew up sensible protective rules on the basis of their experience. Unfortunately those rules got scrapped, just as Glass-Steagall did, once institutional memory became less powerful than the lure of economic expansion.<br><br>As for government regulation, well, I don't know if it's a matter of a maximum being good, but the optimum level of economic regulation does seem to be higher than we have at present, at least here in the US. In the 1950s, when America was as prosperous as it has ever been, the rich paid more than 70% of their income in income tax, banks were tightly controlled by government regulators, and most states had usury laws that banned interest rates above a fairly modest level. As those regulations have been dismantled, in the name of increasing prosperity, the country has gotten steadily less prosperous. I'm beginning to think that this isn't an accident.<br><br>DIYer, any legislation that comes out of the current mess will likely be removed right about the time it becomes necessary again, but ideas set in motion in the wake of the present crisis could have a longer shelf life. We'll see.<br><br><a href=#c208617598771836388 title="comment permalink">10/29/09, 7:21 AM</a><br><br>

He observes that it is ridiculously easy to keep everyone thriving - we are so lucky to find ourselves enmeshed in an abundantly productive ecological system. What the economy has become, instead, is a means to create scarcity, to eradicate the natural surplus. This artificial scarcity forces people to submit to organizational control, since they can only get what they need through the organization. <br><br>Generally, the most effective means to create scarcity is war. It is not a accident that the war machine is such a dominant part of economics and politics. It seems like any kind of equitable distribution of wealth and power is unstable and soon enough small differences snowball into big differences.<br><br>The danger of attempting to institute a flawless system, fair, just, and equitable, is that the ideology of flawlessness tends to blind folks to the actually flaws that inevitably accumulate in this earthly realm. The wonderful system of checks and balances set up by the American founding fathers was a brilliant approach - managing flaws, instead of pretending to eliminate them. But any system has flaws that ultimately fall into a self-amplifying cycle.

Austrian School isn't trying to save the world from itself like Keynsians or Moneterists, they simply try to explain how economics and the business cycle works. I have NEVER read any Austrian School Economist who says the "market" will just magically invent a new energy source. i, and probably others who read your blog, would appreciate if you include links to papers written by Austrian School economists such as Tom Woods or Lew Rockwell when you make your over-reaching generalizations. many of your contentions regarding economic theory sound like theories presented by Keynsians or Monetarists who it seems are hell-bent on destroying whats left of America<br><br>My 2 cents on how the free market does, in fact, help: energy speculation - we all got a real wake-up call when the price of gas shot up to $4.00 a gallon, this caused a lot of people to re-think their "carbon footprint", which is a start to reconfiguring our oil based economy... IMO, the price of oil shot up because of speculators who knew we are close to Peak Oil and saw an opportunity to make a profit (they turned out to be wrong, or did they, is the govt holding down the price of oil?)... so, speculators are helping society to change their habits. Not the greatest argument but i hope you can see where i am coming from. if anything, it is the government who are trying to sell "renewable energy" as our energy savior, go ask Paul Krugman, one of the leading Keynsians, about renewables and he will sing their praises. <br><br>So where does that leave you, the government has been bought and sold and will never endorse policies that you or James Kunstler write about even when we are knee-deep in the coming Crisis. So it seems you may want to examine how the "free market" may come in handy as we slide further down the long descent.<br><br>Austrian School Economics simply explains the natural order of human action, thats it. They aren't Geologists or Engineers and don't pretend to have an understanding into those fields. What they do know is that when a scarse resource cannot meet demand the price will go up which opens the market to competition. will someone come up with a new cheap energy source to compete with oil? they don't claim to know, only that people will try.<br><br>Yeah, i know, and in the mean time we all suffer because no one came up with an energy source and no one planned for a future without oil... well, there is no economic system set up to handle that except maybe fascism and we saw where that got us<br><br>ok this has rambled on long enough, thanks for reading as i beat a dead horse<br><br>JMG, keep fighting the good fight, can't wait to read your next book<br><br><a href=#c4315129845793178882 title="comment permalink">10/29/09, 8:56 PM</a><br><br>

I paraphrase - you said it better: "when wealth is widely distributed, more of it circulates in the productive economy of wages and consumer purchases; when wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few, more of it moves into the investment economy where the well-to-do keep their wealth"<br><br>However, not all forms of investment have the same purposes and effects. People desire different things when they invest. Publius said; "might it not be that the desire for "progress", material advancement, and ever-higher living standards is the basic starting point". Yes, but whose 'progress'? If I care only for my own personal progress, plus my family who will inherit, I could invest in an oil painting or a so-called 'complex financial instrument'. If I care for the progress of my society, I may invest directly in a factory or other business, which will add to the general wealth as well as my own. If I am less concerned about the financial return and more about reputation and prestige, I may publicly give it to charity. Money can be converted into other intangible assets, such as political power as JMG disucesses.<br><br>In this way the character of a society - be it individualistic, socialistic, tradition-loving, future-loving, or whatever - is tied up with the economic decisions of its rich people in a two-way process. Investors are influenced by society, and their decisions shape that society.<br><br>Of course this doesn't imply that a society is homogeneous - think of Victorian England, with well-meaning factory creators as well as assorted villains, scams, and bubbles.<br><br>It seems to me that financial markets, in the widest sense of the word, fail when participants are no longer 'trading' but 'investing', and doing so in the narrowest and most self-seeking way, i.e. to increase personal wealth above all else.<br><br><a href=#c1569308796811675874 title="comment permalink">10/30/09, 6:23 AM</a><br><br>

But if they did i am sure the themes would revolve around individuals being quicker to adapt to changes than the slow-moving, beaurocratic government. If gas rose to $8.00 a gallon i wouldn't wait around for my local government to approve and build up public transportation, i would start riding my bike to work and the grocery store. Similarly, people would probably move closer to the city and organic, sustainable changes might just happen despite the government's best efforts to stop them (just like the bailouts prevented monetary changes that should have occured in the natural order of things). <br><br>BTW.. the "economists" who push free trade onto third world countries are stooges for the IMF who are merely trying to exploit those countries, not help them. Similarly, the "economists" who urged people to buy houses during the housing bubble are also stooges for our government. Paul Krugman, a Keynsian, pushed for a housing bubble back in 2001/2002 as was pointed out by a blogger on Mises.org<br><br>I am sure my rantings will fall on deaf ears as you seem to be pretty set in your views on economists and their "contributions" to society. As with everything else, there are good economists and bad economists and the bad apples are spoiling the bunch.<br><br><a href=#c460348059361722920 title="comment permalink">10/30/09, 8:30 AM</a><br><br>

Still, I'm not sure we need a brilliant political solution so much as a willingness to abandon Utopian fantasies and the pursuit of scapegoats; to remember that compromise is not a dirty word, and screaming insults at one's enemies is not a useful strategy; and to recognize the value in political institutions that have evolved and survived over time because, while imperfect and fallible, they work better in the real world than the alternatives.

A great many provincial Roman farmers and agricultural slaves solved that problem by joining the barbarians or heading for the hills and launching a guerrilla presence of their own; the Romans called these latter <i>bacaudae</i>, and they were a major force in the disintegration of Roman power in some parts of the western empire.<br><br><a href=#c525318725731816610 title="comment permalink">11/1/09, 5:24 PM</a><br><br>

Contrarily, it is a stark vulgarization of "The Wealth of Nations". Regarding labour and even taxation, Smith was almost a <a href=http://www.crossleft.org/node/6594 rel=nofollow>proto-Marxist</a>. It is a little wonder: the classical economists (ending with Marx) were dealing with other kind of governments that we know. Those were no "welfare states" - those were governments of aristocracies, privileged with taxation and rent collection. The new powers of industrialists and merchants were obviously annoyed with that. That was the historical meaning of what "freedom from taxation" meant. Regarding labour, classical economists were not ignorant, but rather reasonable.<br><br>What we got now with the "Smithsonian" drive for "freedom" is exactly the pre-classical of excessive rent/credit payments to the privileged class of bankers, as <a href=http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/hudson-michael_the-rentier-economy.html rel=nofollow>Michael Hudson</a> points out.<br><br>One more curious point: Do you know how many times, and in what context, Adam Smith used the <i>famous</i> phrase "invisible hand"? (<a href=http://www.aier.org/aier/publications/ejw_wat_may09_kennedy.pdf rel=nofollow>answer in PDF</a>)<br><br>There is much to the estimate that the modern economic practice is more about creation of scarcity rather than wealth. If you have a good <i>innovative</i> product idea now, you better orient yourself exclusively to the people in money; your genius is not for loosers ;-] And most seriously: the credit/money system is a big factor in depriving people from what they otherwise could easily have. The more money there is, the more of it is desperately needed, as more people are in debt then. <br><br>A remark for Publius: theories affect our myths more than the other way around. A theory is like a language - it allows you to express and communicate certain thoughts, ideas and visions, perhaps at expense of larger difficulty to comprehend alternative views. It is well know that language affects our personal views profoundly. Once a certain idea is formulated in a theory, people can stick to it so much easier.<br><br><a href=#c7810025810156858225 title="comment permalink">11/2/09, 3:40 AM</a><br><br>

She responded to questions about the current recession, as follows. She observed that this quarter's 3 1/4 percent GDP growth bump is in part due to car purchases through the cash-for-clunkers program, and to spending from the stimulus package (example: workers filling potholes in El Cerrito, CA, where she lives). Her major point seemed to be that it's too soon to tell whether the economy is genuinely in recovery, and spoke of the possibility of a "double dip" in it. She stated that the best indicators of growth (assumed to be inherently good) are new housing construction and tangible business investment, such as purchase of new equipment or facilities. <br>I don't know in what school of economics this places Ms. Olney, but she seemed to have a good head on her shoulders and a good sense of humor too ("Go Bears!" were her closing words, a slightly facetious reference to the UCB football team). Her remarks suggested skepticism about Pres. Obama's current claims of economic recovery, and I sensed nothing evasive, circumlocutious or mealy-mouthed about her presentation. Quite the reverse. But she didn't describe this recent economic uptick as the bouncing of a dead cat. <br><br>I assume "3 1/4 percent" refers to a one quarter period of what would be annual growth at that rate, were it sustained over one year, as 13 percent per annum would surely be spectacular growth.<br><br><a href=#c1633608188806335793 title="comment permalink">11/2/09, 11:22 AM</a><br><br>

In fact there has not been much I could add, so I didn’t. Except, that is, to remind you that one lesson I have learned in my long life is that the future generally either isn’t what you expected, or isn’t when you expected.<br><br>So don’t be disappointed if the details turn out different, perhaps very different, from what you are planning for – I think there will still be plenty of excitement for everyone, just different excitement.<br><br>Oh! And re your comment :” My favorite for the week was a bit of online splutter that, having exhausted its author’s apparently limited vocabulary of profanity, wound up with the nastiest term he knew: “...you American!””<br><br>I’m guessing you might just have to learn to live with that attitude from some non-Americans and not necessarily disregard what that person says because of it.<br><br>I’m Australian and Australia has done very well indeed out of it’s relationship with the USA, so we tend to view the USA, including it’s little foibles like Vietnam, Iraqi, Afghanistan or the sequestering of a large slab of the world’s resource base with a friendly and benevolent eye.<br><br>After all, as I said, Australia has done very well indeed out of the relationship with the USA, yet still kept our other international relationships and options reasonably healthy: A true win-win situation – for Australia.<br><br>However, some other nations seem to think that their relationship with the USA has not been so beneficial – to them.<br><br>I first met this attitude in force when I started spending time in temperate South America, mostly Chile, Argentina and Uruguay.<br><br>I was astonished at the pure loathing I heard educated (my language teachers, businessmen, IT workers) express for the USA. When I questioned them about it I found that they were convinced that the USA, largely the CIA, was heavily involved in some rather unfortunate episodes in their recent history, especially a couple of really nasty right-wing dictators, the aftermath of which they are still struggling to recover from.<br><br>Given that they were there, were tortured themselves, or had relations who disappeared, or fled overseas for a decade or more (quite a few to Australia, more of that later) and given the open USA interference in other South and Central American nations I did not feel qualified to argue the point. What I found particularly disturbing was the number of women who seemed to have had experiences that seemed to be disrupting the rest of their lives and relationships.<br><br>Incidentally, I was surprised at how enthusiastic they all were about Australia. Then I found out that many had spent long periods in Australia after being accepted as refugees, often returning to South America with children largely reared in Australia. <br>As an Australian, that gave me the novel and rather welcome experience of sometimes being greeted as a kind of honorary distant relative in the strangest places.<br><br>Anyway, the point I’m trying to make is that a lot of people in a lot of places feel that they have not had the pleasant experience with the USA that Australia enjoyed. I don’t think you can automatically disregard what they say because that bitterness comes through.<br><br>Stephen Heyer<br><br><a href=#c3552545704168326612 title="comment permalink">11/2/09, 5:14 PM</a><br><br>

In other words, markets where a)"power" did not intervene and fix the game in favor of the biggest winners and b) traders and investors, overall, were smart enough to spot the fraudsters soon enough and blackball them.<br><br>I am careful, here, to distinguish between markets and economies. A market is inherently driven by crowd behavior, so it cannot be expected to act rationally, especially since the crowd can be "played like a violin" by skillful traders and manipulators.<br><br>The economy, in contrast, consists of innumerable, unexciting transactions between individuals and/or businesses. This is what you call the primary economy, as I recall, and it tends to behave rationally -- if not sustainably -- as long as favorable conditions persist. Of course, our present consumer economy is a severe distortion, mostly due to maturation of the science of crowd control and its application to ever-evolving mass media technologies.<br><br>Wardlaw<br><br><a href=#c1131996967416609530 title="comment permalink">11/2/09, 6:14 PM</a><br><br>

(It should perhaps be added that one can maintain such an attitude even while advocating radical policies.) <br><br>Then you said: "Mind you, I'm quite aware that those things will most likely happen shortly after pigs sprout wings and all the trolls on the internet learn manners, but there it is."<br><br>Don't pull your punch so much, I say. It is always worth calling for good behavior, because by doing so you help bring it about, never completely, but at least partially. That's the nature of moral suasion. In my opinion (and this is not really aimed at you, JMG) one of things we've got to overcome is a level of cynicism that has too many people focused on the fact that they can't make a big difference, rather than the fact that they CAN make a small one.<br><br><a href=#c217611425830811865 title="comment permalink">11/3/09, 12:03 PM</a><br><br>

There are a lot of very bright economists out there, and if more of them start to notice that the fundamental preconceptions of their trade are out of whack, some good might come out of it. <br><br>Lynn, that's certainly one viable approach. <br><br>Stephen, I'm well aware of the way that Americans are becoming the rest of the world's favorite whipping boy -- not that we haven't worked overtime to earn that status! A century ago it was Britain's turn -- "Perfidious Albion!" -- and a century from now it will be the turn of whoever has the dominant global empire then. I hope Australia has the common sense not to go for that status. <br><br>Avery, one of the things that makes these discussions so frustrating is that the word "fascist" is not a catchall term for any sort of right wing government one happens to dislike. What Jim was talking about was the possibility of a military coup in the US; military dictatorships usually aren't fascist in the strict sense of the word. (Your local public library probably has some very good books that will explain what fascism actually is.) He's quite right that nobody else in the peak oil scene has been talking about a military coup in the US. I think the prospects of that are quite low, as it happens, and the end of constitutional government is much more likely to happen via some other route. <br><br>Squiggy, there have been plenty of market systems that were not regulated by governments, but there have been no unregulated markets. A market system without government regulation quickly becomes controlled by monopolies. Adam Smith said it best: "People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices." <br><br>Also -- the primary economy is <i>not</i> the economy you're talking about. Nonhuman nature is the primary economy. The secondary economy is the one in which human beings produce and exchange goods and services -- all of which, in one way or another, derive from nature. <br><br>Ben, I certainly think people can make a small difference. Just now, though, with political passions so high and scapegoating so popular, I foresee nothing that will improve this particular problem short of some disaster ghastly enough that the survivors tiptoe past the wreckage for quite some time. Before 1933, German political rhetoric was unprintably nasty; after 1945, things quieted down and got amazingly polite. We may have to go through some comparable crisis to learn the same lesson.<br><br><a href=#c3198955969025387584 title="comment permalink">11/3/09, 2:14 PM</a><br><br>
