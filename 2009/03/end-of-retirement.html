I suppose I shouldn’t have been surprised by the flurry of responses to last week’s <i>Archdruid Report</i> post on the twilight of investment. “Men will forgive the murder of their fathers sooner than the loss of their patrimony,” Machiavelli wrote a long time ago, and the principle can be applied more generally: if you really want to rile people, threaten the money and property they think is securely theirs.<br><br>Unfortunately the word “security” can be applied to any financial asset in today’s economy only in the most ironic of senses. The entire system of economic value that underlies the possibility of investment broke down completely in the speculative excesses of the last thirty years, drowned in a flood of unpayable debts – public, corporate, and private – that were mistakenly classified and then sold as financial assets. The face value of these paper debts vastly exceeds the value of all human economic activities on Earth; the huge majority of them can thus never be paid off, and so they are effectively worthless.<br><br>That awkward fact, if honestly faced, would likely bring the world’s economies to a shuddering halt. Thus we can be confident that it will not be honestly faced. Instead, governments around the world are playing a high-stakes game of make-believe, pretending that the global economy is not bankrupt in the hope that the losses can be spread out over years rather than hitting all at once. For all I know, they may succeed – but even so, the downside will not be pretty.<br><br>One aspect of that downside was on many of my readers’ minds last week, to judge by the comments and emails I fielded. People nowadays invest for many reasons, but one of the most common is retirement. Ever since the American pension system and its government equivalent, Social Security, began to shed their reputation for stability and adequate funding, a growing number of Americans – pushed that way by large and lavishly funded ad campaigns – have placed their hopes for a comfortable old age on investments. The result is a huge fraction of Americans who are emotionally as well as financially invested in the hope that a big payoff from their assets will enable them to have the retirement of their dreams.<br><br>If you are among the people who cling to that belief, I’m sorry to say I have bad news. Over the next decade or so, the huge overhang of paper wealth that now floods the world economy is going to lose nearly all its value. As it goes, it will take your retirement funds with it.<br><br>It’s anyone’s guess exactly how the process will play out. One possibility is a long deflationary spiral in which markets slump, bankruptcies soar, and the legacy of bad debt suffers the death of a thousand cuts. Another is hyperinflation, in which the dollar value of the bad debt still holds good but a cheeseburger costs US$150,000 and workmen take their salaries home in wheelbarrows. Another is a credit crisis in which efforts by governments to fund deficits via borrowing exhaust the world’s dwindling pool of credit, and nations are forced into default. Still another is a political decision on the part of a major debtor nation to default on its foreign debt, leading to panic selling of offshore assets and the collapse of international trade and investment.<br><br>What makes this devastating for those who hope to retire on their current investments is that most current asset classes are part of that overhang of unpayable debt, and the rest are priced at levels that assume that much of the unpayable debt is still boosting the global economy’s net worth. One way or another, those assets will sooner or later move toward their real value, which in the case of most financial assets is nothing, and in the case of most nonfinancial assets is a lot less than they’re worth on paper right now. This means that no matter where you put your investments, you’re likely to lose most of your money.<br><br>Interestingly, this is likely to be true even of commodities such as crude oil which are subject to declining production curves for hard geological reasons. Last year’s price spikes in oil and other energy resources were only partly a product of geological limits on production. The soaring demand growth of an overheating economy, and speculative money flooding into any asset that was gaining in price, both played major parts. Prices collapsed when the speculative money flowed back out, and slumping demand has helped keep prices low since then. As the economy unravels further, the chance of further downside action can’t be dismissed. It has, I think, too rarely been noticed in peak oil circles that there are at least two ways to price oil out of the market; the first is for the price per barrel to soar out of reach, the second is for the economy to contract so sharply that even a modest price per barrel is more than most people can pay.<br><br>For the next decade or so, then, there’s unlikely to be any asset class that will give prospective retirees the income they’ve come to expect. Nor will private pensions, most of which are dependent on investments and vulnerable to corporate bankruptcies, far much better during that time. Nor are government pensions immune; most governments are hemmorrhaging red ink right now, adding to unsupportable debt loads, and the pool of credit available for government borrowing is far from limitless.<br><br>What about after that, when the overhang of debt has been cleared one way or another and this crisis, like all economic crises, finally comes to an end? Well, once again, I have bad news.<br><br>Retirement as a social habit was entirely a product of the zenith of the age of abundance now sliding backwards in our collective rear view mirror. For a brief window of time – rather less than a century – it made financial and political sense for nations in the developed world to pay their elderly citizens to stay out of the work force, in order to keep unemployment down to politically bearable levels. All this unfolded, in turn, from an industrial economy so lavishly supplied with cheap energy that human labor was worth replacing with machines wherever the state of technology permitted, and so greedy for new markets that every part of human life was made subject to market forces.<br><br>Before that period began, something less than half of all economic activity even in the industrial world had anything to do with the market at all. Most women, and many men outside the age of regular employment, worked in a household economy governed by custom and intrafamily exchange rather than market forces. This included essentially everyone who would be eligible for retirement by the standards of the age that has just ended. Outside the market but not outside the demand for skilled human labor, elderly people typically provided household goods and services to a household somewhere in their extended family. That was their full-time job; by contributing the value of their labor and skills, they earned their keep.<br><br>The end of the age of cheap energy means that such household economies will once again be viable. It also means that they will once again be necessary. When the limited energy and resources of a contracting, deindustrial society have to be prioritized for urgent needs, takeout meals and convenience foods will sooner or later draw the short straw; in their absence, most food will once again be made at home from raw materials. When the energy cost of the global network of sweatshops that keeps Americans clothed can no longer be met, a great deal of clothing will once again be made at home from raw fiber, as it was not so long ago, and so on. All this requires human labor. Thus a society no longer supplied with nearly unlimited amounts of cheap abundant energy will have every incentive to keep elderly people in the household labor force, and neither the incentive nor the resources to keep them in comfortable idleness.<br><br>Now of course it’s true that we will not be landing in such a society overnight. It’s also true that the clout of the retiree lobby in most industrial nations is such that public and private pensions will be gutted only when every other option has been exhausted – though in the United States, at least, the vast tide of red ink currently flooding out of Washington DC is likely to bring about this eventuality sooner rather than later. Still, it’s quite possible that at least some of today’s retirees and soon-to-be-retirees will manage to cling to that status, at least for a while.<br><br>If I were asked for advice about retirement, then, it would probably go something like this. If you’re already retired, or within a few years of retirement, it’s probably worth your while to try to get any investment money you have left into a stable investment, if you can find one. Still, it’s probably unwise to assume that your investments will be worth anything in the long terms, and having a Plan B in place would be a very good idea. If you’re more than a decade or so out from retirement, having a Plan B in place is essential. If you’re thirty years out or more out, as I am, forget about Plan A for now; you can look into the options for investment later, once the wreckage of the last few decades has been hauled away and a new economic order has begun to take shape, but you probably will never retire.<br><br>What sort of Plan B might work best for you depends on so many local and personal variables that specifics would almost certainly be misleading. If you’ve got a large family with whom you’re on good terms, bone up on your home ec skills; ten years from now, when four of your grandkids, their spouses, and their children all live in one rundown McMansion, having Grandma and Grandpa there to cook the meals, tend the children, and keep the garden going will likely be worth much more than your keep. If you don’t have a family or can’t stand them, cultivate relationships with younger friends, or get ready to take up a second career that you can continue into advanced old age.<br><br>No matter what you choose, it’s not going to be as fun as sitting on a lawn chair in a Sun Belt trailer park. Still, history is under no obligation to give the options we’d prefer, and a great many pleasant options are going away for a time, or forever, as the industrial age draws to a close.

I would gladly take any of them in, but I would never move (back) to either of those places. Both are sprawling suburbs with lots of issues. With the exception of the very east end of LI, there is no open space on which to grow food on a large scale. My dad's house in FL will be underwater in a few decades if sea levels rise as predicted.

I remember offering your readers awhile back, that in the land I live in it's quite normal of having to work until the day you die. My great grandfather worked until the day he died, my grandfather the same, my Dad, now 77 still working (after a serious heart attack and later a stroke), the chances of me retiring were/are nill. I was taught this would be very likely, as a child. So, it doesn't come to me as a shock at what you're suggesting, as it may be to other readers.<br><br>Along the way of life, I've thought about this (not being able to retire) quite a bit. How would my wife take it, while many of her friends are sipping martinis, basking in the sun at the Florida trailer court?<br><br>I suppose, I can put such thoughts out of my mind, as I'm assured, my "net worth" might actually improve with age... All the while of those that might not have the knowledge/experience that I've acquired (over the years), will be the ones who are struggling.<br><br>At any point John, it's somewhat comforting to me (perhaps in a sick way), that I won't be alone in this endeavor, that I'll likely have company...<br><br>Finally, I've the land to thank, that I even have this oppertunity....<br><br>That is something to consider, it's the only "security" that I've even known, as my father, as his father, as his father.....<br><br>Thanks, yooper<br><br><a href=#c6698059330095764766 title="comment permalink">3/4/09, 4:43 PM</a><br><br>

After 20 years of living on the roller coaster that is the financial industry, I'm steeply underfunded and accept that I will not be able to retire 10 years from now. Therefore, I'm attempting to build a home-based business online while acquiring old-fashioned hard skills that may be marketable in a different future. <br><br>The idea of spending my declining years in a Sun City or a trailer park is pretty demoralizing anyway. Many people, including a large number known to me personally, mostly professionals, work clear up to age 90, and have vast hordes of knowledge to share that comes only with 60 years or more of constant practice and study.These people tend to be much happier, healthier, and intact than people who retreat into a vegetative retirement at one of those ghastly retirement parks. <br><br>Many retirees of my acquaintance are working merely because they can't stand the thought of being "put out to pasture". I believe that humans have a strong need to know that they can still function and meet their own needs, and feel reduced and infantilized by the conditions of retirement. <br><br>Perhaps, as more elders continue to participate in the economy on all levels of endeavor, old age will command the respect it once did. I believe our young people desperately crave the guidance and example set by healthy, functional, and wise old people- I remember one young man commenting on Kunstler's blog that he wanted older people who were true Elders. It is certainly more edifying to be a contributor than it is to be someone who needs to be taken care of.<br><br><a href=#c6283394383228542214 title="comment permalink">3/4/09, 5:21 PM</a><br><br>

I agree with everything you say... except for oil and other commodities. I don't agree that prices will go so high that no one can afford to buy, at least not in a free market where everyone has equal access (i.e. governments don't monopolize resources). Prices will go so high as the market will bear and no higher. At some point the person who holds commodities will want to sell, and the person who wants to buy will buy, and depending on the culture and the personalities involved each side will go away feeling bad or good, but the trade will have been done. In the case of hyperinflation of the dollar, some other currency will be used as a store of value, cigarettes, whisky, bricks of Afghani hashish, ammunition, whatever, but trade will still continue so long as people produce more of something than they can use or store for a long period of time. The US dollar may soon fall; there will be something to replace it, because the convenience of cash as a store of value and medium of exchange will make it in itself a needed commodity for the continuation of trade.<br><br><a href=#c8647829703917350299 title="comment permalink">3/4/09, 6:15 PM</a><br><br>

From the time I finished school up to the present, I have sought to live my life in such a way that it is sometime I never want to stop, to retire from. I want to do what I am doing now until I croak. <br>It was sad to watch my father put in his time (40 years) at a job he had come to hate just so he could retire and live his "dream", the "American dream". And after he got his Floridian house and played golf 4 times a week, he found himself bored to tears. Meaning gone, roots pulled up, life experiences and lessons learned to pass on to his offspring forgotten. Now it seems he is just waiting for the bus.<br>I knew back in 1980 that there would be no Social Security when/if I got to be eligible. Don't know how I knew, but I was convinced that what ever I put into the system would not come back to me. And that was and is okay. I haven't got a retirement fund to be worried over. I have skills that will continue to pay dividends long after money has no value. I feel very fortunate.<br><br><a href=#c6695654452541995242 title="comment permalink">3/4/09, 6:23 PM</a><br><br>

The people would buy shares, and then when young people or others who are money-short but with the abilities, skills, and manpower to create a small needed business for your community, you could fund the operation for a share of goods, services, etc. Maybe even some cash return. A smart older person could help insure their continuing needs by investing in the education and startup expenses of a young community health professional (sort of like the "Northern Exposure" situation). There are ways like these to put money right now in local investments and helping yourself and the community develop the local resources that will be needed rather than the illusion.<br><br><a href=#c4296544735133009437 title="comment permalink">3/4/09, 7:05 PM</a><br><br>

This post seems like an epilogue to that one and I would have to agree with you on most of your points. I think it would be wise to back off on predicting events with a time frame in mind. What we are seeing now is an out and out panic with collapse of a mania in financial instruments not unlike panics from the Tulip mania in Holland to the South Sea Bubble and others. These occurred before cheap fossil fuels and manias and panics will probably be with us after we've pumped the last barrel out of Ghawar. The importance of this panic is that it is the first(last?)global panic on the downside of Peak Oil. It is a fundamental tenet of us Peak Oil True Believers that most of the wealth created by cheap oil will disappear with expensive or unavailable oil. But this panic has the potential to destroy wealth before Peak Oil can get its licks in and thus getting this sort of wealth back with expensive oil will be impossible. I agree with you that lots of nations will default. It's happened before. France defaulted about 8 times between 1500 and 1800. The Icelandic banking whiz kids piled up debt exceeding 800% of their GDP or about $400,000 per man, woman and child. How can that be repaid? The transfer of our wealth, real or chimerical, to oil producers means that if it continues, Persian Gulf oil producers could own many of our national assets from farmland to real estate and companies of all stripes. Why should they continue buying T Bills?<br> This civilization will fall for reasons well written by you, Joseph Tainter and others. There are a myriad of factors that could hasten or delay it from a massive natural disaster to the usual factors of wars and disease. Within a hundred years or two, we will probably be like the typical Englishman of the 17th century who lived a lifetime within a radius of 10 miles.We will produce most of our food and goods locally, make music and dance to it in our own villages. It's this transition that has me worried. The entire nation is suffering from a collective cognitive dissonance from Barak on down. There will be a lot of people who are going to be real sore when they find out their promised pensions, social security, health care and retirement assets are toast.Because I like to write, I see a lot of good material coming my way but I'm afraid a lot of folks will not take the looming tumult with good grace.<br><br><a href=#c6134689239430189717 title="comment permalink">3/4/09, 8:31 PM</a><br><br>

It is remarkable how the critics were (made) so indistinct. Al Gore certainly warned nothing of what is coming.<br><br>But as for Social Security solvency - well, folks, its fund was calculated still to get <b>income</b> until 2018 or so. But that date (still quite distant for today's turbulent world) was painted as the end of Social Security! <br><br>I can understand that people, after so many talking heads lying, may have serious doubts that a system like SS can last "forever". But the fact is: no public pension fund has ever collapsed yet. Their long-term "unsolvable" problems are still just a theory. But politicians work quite hard to make public pension funds collapse.<br><br>Some even say that Social Security is as unstable as a Ponzi scheme. But the crucial difference is: Social Security does not need <b>exponential</b> corrections to correct its problems. The aging bumps could still be solved by <b>proportionate</b> corrections, still quite possible politically in a right climate. The stock market "solution" was an outright folly - baby boomers have to pay extra to enter the more competitive market, and then get less when "competitively" exiting.<br><br>How would a decent pension fund suffer an economic crisis like this? The fund like SS would not suffer disproportionally much - unless it is used (since LB Johnson allowed) to fund bailouts or, say, wars. As for the stock market "solution" - well, it is one of the big <br><b>reasons</b> of the sharp boom-and-bust. Which way is a Ponzi scheme?<br><br>Archdruid did not particularly criticize public pension funds, though his skepticism is clear. I see Social Security not that much as an entitlement but as a social construct to reduce some (elder care) burden for the middle class. I believed that SS worked quite well this way, and could work much longer if only the "for-the-people" political climate was sustainable.<br><br>The thing is, the peak-technology collapse (that is constantly discussed here) is approaching much faster with the investment and consumption craze that was radically over-stimulated recently. This financial collapse is becoming (accidentally or not) only the first one of coming breakdowns.<br><br>Today I posted <a href="http://www.eurotrib.com/?op=displaystory;sid=2009/3/5/51110/63290" rel=nofollow>this article</a>, that tangentially touches similar theme.<br><br><a href=#c2697954930452297171 title="comment permalink">3/5/09, 3:00 AM</a><br><br>

We will need to REBUILD the system so that it is not built on the motion of endless economic growth and instead a system which provides stability in times of negative economic growth. I predict that if the industrial system does fail, a lot of debt will be forgiven and at some point society discusses allowing individuals to take back the land from the hands of corporate liens and corporate control, and the "corporate profits at all costs" economic policy is dropped. <br><br> When this happens, we will probably rework suburbia by bulldozing some houses to put community gardens on them and grow our food locally, and work to revitalize the shops and other things to produce goods locally. If we did this now, it would save an enormus amount of fuel and resources. I am not saying that there will not be ways for people to travel across the country or the world post-peak oil (i.e. boats, railroads, airplanes powered by Algae and Jatropa, etc) on a smaller scale than today.<br><br>As to retirement, one might be asked to put save some money in cash (not stocks or bonds), and that savings could evolve over a number of years to have some money for retirement. Perhaps the retirement age will get raised to say 72 instead of 65. Perhaps younger people will voluntary help care for their elders. Maybe when relocalization occurs, we could provide a quality set of activities for seniors in their own community, and give them discounts on boat and rail if they want to go a few places. All of this needs to be thought out and put on a local level.<br><br><a href=#c1276238934019157278 title="comment permalink">3/5/09, 10:09 AM</a><br><br>

In many of the subjects we’re discussing here, timing is critical ... and also very difficult to predict.<br><br>One of the things I like about your approach, JMG, is that you say civilizations decline over a long period of time, with ups and downs. This really makes intuitive sense to me.<br><br>In a post in April 07, you wrote "The most likely course for the decline and fall of industrial civilization is a cyclic process, in which periods of respite and partial recovery punctuate the downward curve that leads into the dark ages of the deindustrial future."<br> <br>In another post, May 2007, you wrote: “...history does seem to be contingent rather than determined – which is to say, of course, that in human affairs slight causes can have vast effects, and trying to predict the future in advance is a risky proposition at best.”<br><br>However, in our personal lives we need to make practical decisions based on what we think will happen over the next two, five or ten years. You know, that may be impossible to predict, and we just have to take our best guess. Personally, I think I’m going to divide my resources ... since I don’t know what’s going to happen in the short term, I’m going to try to be prepared for more than one possibility.<br><br>I’d like to encourage the community of this blog to be a bit more cautious when making predictions about what will happen in the next two or three years. Let’s remember all those folks who were so certain that on January 1, 2000, we were going to wake up in a completely different world... and then it didn’t happen. Often you get a feeling in your personal life where you’re sure something is going to happen (your boss is about to dump you, or so-and-so is going to be your good friend) ... and then it doesn’t happen.... we all know that feeling, as if you stepped on a step that wasn’t there. Then you shake your head and adjust to a new reality. <br><br>We realize we’re facing likely changes in the coming decades, and the better we can envision the probabilities, the better we can prepare for them. At the same time, let’s also keep a sense of the uncertainty, unpredictability, impermanence, of the future conditions we foresee. <br><br>Last week, I posted information about developing skills in sewing machine repair. This week I want to add: I do think those skills will come in handy at some point in our future; I’m not predicting when.<br><br><a href=#c3290279008228936598 title="comment permalink">3/8/09, 3:23 PM</a><br><br>

I know it happened in Germany between the wars, and in Zimbabwe today... but I don’t know any of the details. As a historian you could fill in some of the gaps.

However, there's more to be said beyond your point that "on average, all investments go down" in a shrinking economy. I hope I'm right, since I plan to retire next year. (Not silver-haired yet, but that will come.)<br><br>Certainly, in an economy which is static or declining on average, "growth" stocks will be rare. Index funds will be sure of a net decline over the long run, and there will be no basis for the familiar yields from bonds or CDs. Solid creditors will not be lending money at such interest rates. "Inflation-indexed" bonds based on a wildly distorted CPI will only compensate for a third or so of actual inflation, and the proportion seems to be declining.<br><br>Still, if you have money to invest, you can buy dividend-paying stocks and trusts in enterprises that seem to have a solid future. Oil, gas and coal resources and extraction are obvious choices- declining over the long term, but likely to pay dividends as long as a firm's resources last.<br><br>As the "green" industries and energy sources develop and mature, there should be profitable companies offering dividend-paying stocks. <i>Barron's</i> last week had a few recommendations on this theme.<br><br>Market swings and general asset deflation will hurt the market value of these stocks and trusts, but the objective is income, not growth in value. Naturally, you would try to buy when prices are relatively low.<br><br>Though not easy or simple, you can invest directly in renewable resources such as cropland, orchards, groves or grazing land. These will hold their value, subject to the effects of climate change, and will pay a steady rent, though not as high as more common forms of income real estate.<br><br>When your national currency seems poised for another decline in value, precious metals are a good temporary alternative. Government bonds in other currencies may be, also. <br><br>In a world of "fiat" currencies, you can seek a Volkswagen: one that loses value more slowly than the others. Currencies of resource-rich countries may be good candidates, though I can't claim any success in this area.<br><br>These are the ideas I've tried to apply, and I'm hoping they'll work well enough to support my wife and I in retirement. Social security will give substantial help, too, as long as it lasts. <br>- Bob Wise<br>bobwise32952@bellsouth.net<br><br><a href=#c1426514463007123322 title="comment permalink">3/13/09, 3:31 AM</a><br><br>

Which do you choose?<br><br>1. Personal car transportation 25% energy<br>2. Industrial farming system and delivery of food 25%.<br>3. Industrial power for businesses 25%.<br>4. Home heating and cooling. 25%<br><br>Each of the above have about 25% of the energy usage. These are a little rough as figures but it's about a quarter of the energy to each.<br><br>We could lose as much as 68% of our energy if all imports of fuel stopped. But Nafta has Canada tied at the hip and they will likely stay tied to our economy and provide us with 14% of our energy regardless. They will likely sink in the same mire. So that's up to 50% loss of energy.<br><br>The 2008 Peak Oil conference which JMG and others sat at, last question and answer session mentioned going toward full organic. Bascically abandoning industrial farming and using rail. 50 million organic farmers and such. <br><br>This might be a workable long transitional plan 20 or 30 years, but as a short term plan would probably not work. Why? Because we'd need to still try to repay some debt, even if our dollar collapses for some trading to continue and to hope to get our of our massive foreign debts we need to maintain some export value which is industry and farming outputs. This means Obama being in the pragmatic center and trying to please all and maintain the past will likely keep farming and industry.<br><br>I think if we have to cut out in a shock dollar collapse two of the four listed in my post above, the two most likely to go would be:<br><br>Personal transportation via cars. This by severe limits on gas per week ration per family (like a gallon a week.) That stops all driving dead.<br><br>And we simply cut off the heating and cooling to houses. So severely that people must reconfigure and perhaps even house share and just board up houses. Heat and cooling would be supplied at work, and workers would stay at work and sleep in sleeping bags at work during the week. They would then travel home for the weekend with the family and use very little energy and perhaps tend to gardens. <br><br>By cutting personal transportation and home heating and cooling, we cut back 50% of our energy use for a shock dollar collapse and still get food delivered and some kind of industrialized soup distribution as well as other foods.<br><br>The other option to me, if it was a sped up option, of trying to go organic right away would result in massive starvation like they had in Cambodia. It would be a mass forced move to the coutryside like the cultural revolution in China. It would provide no excessive food exports because our energy would be going to railroads and warm houses, instead of producing food for ourselves and others.<br><br>To think we cannot be food sufficient and maintain an industrial food production system, farmers are the MOST productive per capital, not the least, is to me looking at the short term shock problems through long term hopeful farming glasses. We need to think about the alternatives.<br><br>I hope my post hasn't been to much off topic. Regarding change and retirement I talked to my father the other day and mentioned a neighbor thought he was a millionaire and he thought the old neighbor was as well. I said, you guys both think the other guy is loaded. My father (who was born in 1928, and lived through the depression as a child) replied and said, "well I am a millionaire, I have you." He was looking very pragmatically on the value of a child to aid the family. <br><br>So there's the future Social Security and pension fund for you, you're children if your lucky.<br><br><a href=#c529736175505536296 title="comment permalink">4/8/09, 11:43 AM</a><br><br>
