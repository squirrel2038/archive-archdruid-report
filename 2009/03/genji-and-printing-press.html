The relation of technology to time is a theme that’s come up more than once in these essays, and for good reason. On the one hand, many of the challenges we face as industrial civilization lurches down the long curve of its decline and fall come from the mismatch between the short timeframe that governs so many of our collective decisions and the long reach the consequences of those decisions so often have.<br><br>On the other, a crucial aspect of our predicament just now – though it’s not often recognized as such – is the fact that most of our modern technologies are very poorly adapted to the long term. Most of the technologies used by today’s industrial societies depend directly or indirectly on nonrenewable resources that, in the broad scheme of things, simply won’t be around all that much longer. Those technologies that can’t be reworked to use entirely renewable inputs, or that stop being economical once the costs of renewables has to be factored in, will go away in the decades and centuries to come, with profound impacts on human life.<br><br>In that light, it’s comforting to realize that our species has managed to come up with a certain number of extremely durable technologies. Agriculture, despite the assertions of its modern neoprimitivist critics, is at least capable of being one of those. The rice paddies of eastern Asia, the wheat fields of Syria and the olive orchards and vineyards of Greece and Italy, to name only a few examples, have proven sustainable over many millennia, and will likely still be viable long after today’s idiotically unsustainable petrochemical agriculture has become a footnote in history books written in languages that haven’t evolved yet.<br><br>There are other examples. One in particular, though, plays an important role in my own hopes for the future, not least because I work with it every day: the technology of the book.<br><br>One volume on my bookshelf right now makes as good an example as any. It’s an English translation of <i>The Tale of Genji</i>, one of the world’s first and greatest novels. It was written by a Japanese noblewoman, Murasaki Shikibu, at the beginning of the eleventh century for a circle of friends, and wove together her wry reflections on court life with a sense of the impermanence of all earthly things. Like so many novels of an earlier age, it demands more patience than most of today’s readers like to give to fiction; its storyline unfolds at a leisurely pace, following the path of its decidedly unheroic hero, Prince Genji, through the social milieu of his time. Think of it as <i>War and Peace</i> without the war; the political struggles that frame Genji’s career, sending him from the capital into exile and then returning him to the upper reaches of power, all take place without a hint of violence.<br><br>This is all the more striking because the society in which Murasaki lived was well on its way to a violent decline and fall. Her lifetime marked the zenith of the age Japanese historians call the Heian period. Over the next century and a half, the Japanese economy came apart, public order disintegrated in a rising spiral of violence, and the government lost control of the provinces where the new samurai class was taking shape. The civil wars that began in 1156 shredded what was left of Heian society and plunged Japan into a dark age four and a half centuries long.<br><br>Countless cultural treasures vanished during those years, but <i>The Tale of Genji</i> was not among them. One of the advantage of books is that, properly made, they are extremely durable; another is that they have very little value as plunder, and so tend to get left behind when looters come through. Both these advantages worked in favor of Murasaki’s novel, and so did the patient efforts of generations of Buddhist monks and nuns who did for their culture what their equivalents in Dark Age Europe did a few centuries earlier.<br><br>It’s not the only volume on my bookshelves that came through the fall of a civilization intact. A good shelf and a half of Greek philosophy and mathematics hid out in Irish monasteries while Rome crashed to ruin and nomads fought over the rubble, and so did an assortment of literary works from Greece and Rome, including a couple – Homer comes to mind – that came out of the dark ages before Greece and Rome, and so get extra credit. The Chinese classics on another shelf went through more than that; Chinese civilization has immense staying power but its political systems tend to be fragile, and such seasoned survivors as Lao Tsu’s <i>Tao Te Ching</i> have shrugged off half a dozen cycles of decline and fall.<br><br>Still, the granddaddy of them all is next to the Greek classics. The epic of Gilgamesh was first composed well over five thousand years ago by some forgotten poet of Sumer, the oldest literate society anybody has yet been able to find. It’s not something most people read in school, which is ironic, because the epic of Gilgamesh is the kind of story we most need to read these days: a story about limits. When he first strides into the story, Gilgamesh is about as far from Prince Genji as a fictional character can get; superhumanly strong, with an ego to match, he makes Conan the Barbarian look like Caspar Milquetoast; but his ego sends him on a long journey through love, loss, and a shattering confrontation with the human condition that leaves little of his arrogance intact. It’s a story well worth reading even, or especially, today.<br><br>The astonishing thing, at least to me, is that I can take that book from its place on the shelf today and read a story that had audiences on the edge of their seats five thousand years ago. Precious little else from Sumer survives at all; five thousand years is a long time, especially in a corner of the world where more civilizations have risen and fallen than just about anywhere else. That’s what I mean about the durability of books as a technology of information storage and transfer. Even though individual books break down over time, it costs little to manufacture them and little except time to copy them, and they weather copying mistakes remarkably well; unlike today’s data storage methods, where a very small number of mistakes can render data hopelessly corrupt, a book can still pass on its meaning even when the copy is riddled with scribal errors.<br><br>All this bears directly on the predicament of industrial society. Our age will certainly leave its share of legacies to the far future, but most of those are the opposite of helpful. (I am thinking especially of the nuclear waste we are heaping up in “temporary” storage facilities, which will likely be lethally radioactive dead zones surrounded by cow skulls on sticks 25,000 years from now.) Of our positive achievements, on the other hand, the ones most likely to reach our descendants 5000 years from now are the ones written in books.<br><br>Thus I’d like to suggest that books, and the technologies that produce and preserve them, might well deserve a place well up on the list of useful things that need to be preserved through the long decline ahead of us. I wish it made sense to count on public libraries, but those venerable institutions have gotten the short end of the stick now for decades, and the dire fiscal straits faced by most state and local governments in the US now do not bode well for their survival. (The county next to the one where I live, for example, has already shuttered its entire library system, and handwaving has replaced any meaningful plan to reopen it.) Like so many other things of value, book technology may have to be saved by individuals and local voluntary groups, using their own time and limited resources.<br><br>It might come down to copying books with pen and ink onto handmade paper, but there may well be another viable option. Letterpress technology is simple enough to make and maintain – the presses that sparked a communications revolution in Europe in the fourteenth century were built entirely with hand tools – and brings with it the power to produce a thousand copies of a book in the time a good scribe would need to produce one. With printing presses, something like the book culture of colonial America – with local bookstores, libraries open to anyone willing to pay a modest subscription, and private book collections – comes within reach, at least in regions that maintain some level of stability and public order. This may not seem like much in an age of internet downloads, but it beats the stuffing out of Dark Age Europe, when most people could count on living out their lives without turning the pages of a book.<br><br>Now of course there are plenty of people who argue that the age of internet downloads is worth preserving, or that some other more advanced technology would be a better place to start. It seems to me, though, that at least two factors argue against this. The first is that all of the more complex data storage technologies presuppose an extensive technological base, supported by plenty of energy and an economy diverse enough that resources can be diverted from survival to less critical needs. The crises looming in our future make the secure maintenance of these conditions something of a gamble against long odds.<br><br>These complex technologies, furthermore, are not something that individuals and local communities can tackle on their own. That makes it a good deal less likely that anybody will get around to tackling them at all. As the collective response to the latest round of economic crises has demonstrated all too well, short-term crisis management and pedaling in place have elbowed aside any more thoughtful or proactive response to future needs. A society in which executives are shaking down their bankrupt corporations for one more round of million-dollar bonuses, while governments pour money they don’t have and credibility they’re rapidly losing down a growing list of ratholes, is not a society in which the funds and resources to retool much of anything for a sustainable future will be forthcoming from above. That likely means that whatever gets done will have to be done by individuals – and the sort of local, decentralized, individual approach to the survival of book technology I’ve suggested in this post might make a workable template for the kind of strategy that could work for many other things as well.

I just attended the Smallpressapaloosa at Powell's City of Books, learned about the Independent Publisher's Resource Center here in Portland, and their letterpress workshops, and felt a personal urge to learn the art of paper making. I also just finished reading The Long Descent, and I think it was in there that you talked about Carl Sagan or another scientist advocating the amassing of all current scientific knowledge into one encyclopedia, and however well intentioned an idea that might be, it wouldn't turn out to be at all beneficial for future generations.<br> It seems that the more people who learn to make their own paper, choose which books THEY want to help live into the far future, the better chance we all have of preserving so much of what matters through the coming crises.<br>I've enjoyed reading about new versus old technology in the last few posts. Most of the time I neglect to notice anything about the underlying technologies that make our modern life possible. <br>Thanks again for your insights- I look forward to reading them again next week.<br>By the way, do you have any speaking engagements near Portland anytime in the future?<br>-Brian Bost<br><br><a href=genji-and-printing-press.html#c3152025640564400466 title="comment permalink">3/18/09, 11:40 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avtb a_12120c" id=c6980863472344192121></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/00627270393248813976 rel=nofollow>Danby</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>One other limitation of technological data storage is the limited shelf life of digital media. People think that somehow a CD or hard drive put on a shelf will still be full there when they want to retrieve it. <br><br>As a system administrator I have to battle on a daily basis with the unreliability of digital storage. Typical writable CDs and DVDs are good for 2 years. cheap ones for as long as 5. <br><br>Magnetic media fare a little better. While the vast majority of floppy disks and archive tapes have already started losing data, Hard drives, left on a shelf have been known to retain good copies for as long as 25 years. How today's ultra-high bit density drives will fare over the long term is not entirely clear. The areas of magnetic flux on the surface of the disk are almost nanoscale, and quite closely packed. Natural magnetic drift will eventually do them in, but no-one knows how long it will take.<br><br>But even worse than the media reliability problem is the format problem. A typical hard drive from the '80s used MFM or RLL encoding. If you don't have an MFM or RLL disk controller, how will you read them. And there have been none of those controllers made since about 1990. The old ones might work fine, but the 8MHZ ISA bus they plug into is a relic of the electronic stone age. Presuming all the XT and AT compatible computers are gone (which is not far from the actual case, here 30 years into the computer revolution) how can one read these disks? To rebuild a machine that could read them would require hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions, <i>even though the design work has already been done</i>. <br><br>Now suppose that that design work was lost, as it might very well be in the event of significant societal disruption. How would an engineer even start to reverse engineer the device to begin extracting data? <br><br>And, once the data is extracted, what will you read it with? I've been in the hot seat trying to extract archived data from three different older systems. Usually we can get the files extracted. The comes the problem of figuring out what the bits in the file mean. On one project, the company decided to simply forgo twenty years worth of accounting data, since no surviving company or living person could be located who knew what the file format was, and the lowest bid we could get for the reverse engineering work came to $2 million.<br><br>The great vulnerability of digital data is that it <b>requires</b> maintenance. Interrupt that for even a few years and you will start seeing losses. Interrupt for a couple of decades and most, if not all, will be completely unusable. How many societies have gone without interruption over the long term?<br><br>And all the while books still work.<br><br><a href=genji-and-printing-press.html#c6980863472344192121 title="comment permalink">3/18/09, 11:53 PM</a><br><br>

Real paper that has any chance of lasting needs to be made from a fiber like cotton or linen. I's actually surprisingly easy to produce aside from the massive pulp-making machine that is required to shred the fibers enough for them to be useable. The shredding process is a pretty energy intense effort, although I suppose you could get a horse or windmill to help out. The alternative is sheepgut or other vellum.<br><br>Strangely enough as I write this I am listening to you on C2C AM talking about UFO's. I've seen a couple and I'm pretty sure they weren't dark ops or any other government tech. As the ever expanding edifice of western scientism begins to crumble and dissolve beneath the weight of it's own hubris, the cognitive dissonance noted by Jacques Valle and others will likely disappear, and I'm sure we will be witness to a panoply of colorful entities in addition to the Grays....jinns, sprites, boulder-grinders, incubi, chupacbre....etc. Maybe metal men from the Modern Age..ghosts from the tin-machine.

Wouldn't it be absolutely convenient to some ruling circles to have a unique "theory" what or who was responsible for the collapse, and how a society should be governed, while eradicating any alternative knowledge? How much would it take in a collapsing world to "take care" of most libraries and book stores in the world, or "wrong" political, history or science books, or stubborn dissenters and "dangerous" collectors? <br><br>Wouldn't it be possible that some elites would secretly enjoy a variety of today's technology and knowledge, occasionally baffling their folks with "miracles" while skillfully manipulating them with both age-tested and today's methods of psychology and social sciences?<br><br>Is it unthinkable that some past collapses of local civilizations resulted in a prolonged manipulating rule of elites that actually knew better what happened (or what was available) just before the last collapse?<br><br>Can we speculate that quite advanced technology and knowledge were developed even before the known civilizations (say, in between the ice ages), but basically all of it were suddenly lost?<br><br>I saw one book with <a href=http://www.maa.org/reviews/forgottenrevolution.html rel=nofollow>a particular theory</a>, that the Hellenistic Greeks were making a quantitative leap in technology and scientific understanding (with Archimedes, Herophilos, Hipparchus, Appolonius, Euclides, Eratosthenes, Hero of Alexandria...), but most of it was lost under transition to the "practically oriented" Roman Empire and the Dark Ages. <br><br>If bursts of science/technology revolutions can occur and fade so fast, can we guess better how the famous isolated ancient "wonders" actually came about? Wouldn't anyone be tempted to control that cycle of (as I can imagine) long suppression of advanced knowledge followed by an exited acceleration?<br><br><a href=genji-and-printing-press.html#c5310216588750543904 title="comment permalink">3/19/09, 2:41 AM</a><br><br>

For example mail armour was best in XVIth century shortly after it became less popular than plate armour, or kerosene lamps like the Aladdin came out in the 1920s when already being retired by electricity.<br><br>So I am trying to imagine what advances came to the old printing press after the computer age, that will be worthy to develop further...<br><br>I also wonder if that old medieval devil, Titivillus, is responsible for the new digital mistakes and loses...<br><br><a href=genji-and-printing-press.html#c4445046363430815517 title="comment permalink">3/19/09, 3:51 AM</a><br><br>

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c8599421628558871898></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/14135517633690314840 rel=nofollow>Arthur Vibert</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Thank you for another excellent blog post. When I was in art school in the '70s I learned letterpress as part of the curriculum. We pulled type from California cases and assembled it by hand. Letter spacing was accomplished with small metal shims or, in cases where only tiny adjustments were necessary, with tiny strips of paper. And we did it backwards, of course.<br><br>It is a craft in a way that working from the computer is not. And while I find the computer to be a wonderful tool for design, the fact that one can work so quickly means that the time one would, in a simpler age, have taken for reflection and contemplation about what one is creating is lost. <br><br>I think this is true in other arts in which the computer has become ascendant. In music, synthesizers, samplers, and various other devices have replaced traditional instruments. Acoustic instruments can be plucked, or struck, or blown through and one can see the parts that make the sound. If you open the computer and look inside you will be hard pressed to figure out where the music is coming from, apart from the speaker. <br><br>Music can be written down so that others can play it centuries from when it was originally composed. The computer means that musicians don't need to read music and don't need to master their instruments. But without computers, what happens to all the music created on them?<br><br>Film is another example. In traditional (!) chemical-based film it was possible, after the film was developed, to hold up a strip of it and see actual pictures. There are no more pictures on celluloid. It's all being replaced by digital acquisition of images, digital assembly and digital projection. Even traditional film is an ephemeral medium - much has already been lost in the brief existence of film on this planet. It will only become worse in the brave new digital world.<br><br>When art becomes commoditized - as everything in our civilization must be, it seems - no one cares if it will survive for ten years because we are looking for the next film, or book, or pop tune before we've finished the one we're on. I was commenting to a friend that before the advent of recorded music one would be lucky to hear any given symphony performed more than once in one's life. People usually heard these things by playing piano transcriptions. You can imagine that, for example, Beethoven's 9th would probably lose something in translation. You can also imagine what a transcendental experience hearing the symphony played by a full orchestra would have been. When you've heard it 100 times by the time you're 20 it loses something.<br><br>I could (obviously) go on forever about this. My point is that while the computer has given us astonishing efficiencies, it has taken something in return. Just as it is now easier and faster to create on the computer, that which we create is fated to live a dramatically shorter life. It's a Faustian bargain for our Faustian civilization. Sic transit gloria mundi.<br><br><a href=genji-and-printing-press.html#c8599421628558871898 title="comment permalink">3/19/09, 6:31 AM</a><br><br>

I think that the bitsphere may be lost to us faster than many of us believe, leaving a great deal of information that would be useful in the early days of the descent marooned beyond reach.<br><br>I was speaking with a friend in our peak oil group who runs an electronics manufacturing business, who asked "Do you have anything with a chip in it that is over 15 years old and still works?." I had to say not. Neither did he.<br><br>Not enough energy and capital to maintain the infrastructure, decay of storage media, and decay of the devices that allow access. Combined I'd guess these factors could give digital data a half-life as short as 5 years.

The idea of the book as a lasting technology also leads to an issue that you raised briefly in a post or writing that I read some time ago: that of the useful and necessary skills that might be developed during the period of descent which would be socially beneficial in the future. Writing as a technology is of course, key; there is a role for those who will be entrusted with preservation of our narratives and myths and epics, the writers and the historians and the artists in our society, who would provide access to what might be the lost information of the future. Here is where I found your suggestions, yet undeveloped, on the craft of memory to be most intriguing; the value that might be placed upon cultivating scholars of the arts of memory, so those who will preserve the narrative (in books, or in oral traditions, or in "art" forms) have alternative resources to which to turn. Mnemonics as a means of encoding and storing knowledge - and as an enduring human technique. So very different from the "human computer" or "the human calculator." And I am not speaking only about savants, but of a kind of training or schooling that has been lost or is so specialized as to be hidden in the modern world. But completely useful.

I certainly don't mean to suggest that everything labeled as a UFO is a cover story for the current generation of black budget aerospace projects, though I think it's pretty much an open secret these days that the UFO mythology has been used by a number of governments to distract attention from quite a few aerial activities that needed to stay off the front pages of the newspapers. <br><br>Das Monde, one thing that happens almost always in a collapse is that the elite of the collapsing society get their throats cut -- as often as not by their own bodyguards.

Just to mention one detail, most of the people I know who know how to turn fiber into thread with a hand spindle -- a highly useful skill in a deindustrializing world -- are SCA members. <br><br>Arthur, since the ascendancy of the computer will most likely be self-terminating, my guess is that the problem you've outlined will correct itself. <br><br>Guamanian, shorthand and stenography are very ancient -- I could see text message habits being absorbed into some future system along those lines. <br><br>Kabir, I don't know of any project along those lines. As for your idea of a monastery with big data banks, well, that only works if you're thinking in the relatively short term -- much less than a century, say -- because components degrade so rapidly.

Typewriters would be a good related technology to preserve as well: they can be built with late 19th century technology, consuming only (inked) ribbons, paper, and muscle power. Making paper seems to be a straightforward process, according to several sites I found with "the google." You need fibrous material to comprise the pulp, water, and a frame to dry it on. One can hope the process becomes widespread enough that next century's equivalent of monks don't erase books to make room for their own manuscripts.<br><br>Retrieving data more than a few years old can certainly be an issue — I remember when Microsoft Word would not read more than one major revision backwards. (For example, 4.0 wouldn't read files written in Word 2.0.) Even without that issue, tools themselves get replaced fairly regularly… Word*Star, anyone? The whole thrust of SGML, and XML after it, is to improve the shelf life of data — especially the written word. As long as computers can read plain text files, the thought goes, it should be possible to extract meaningful data from markup.<br><br>Now if computers themselves go away — and I have a couple of dinosaurs that still work, one of which is over 20 years old — then only what's on paper is going to be preserved, and a slow decline would allow this to happen. Unless the fast-crash scenario comes true, anything considered important (at the time, and by the "right" people, of course) should end up on paper and thus have a chance of making it through the bottleneck.<br><br>I don't see computing technology going away soon, but long-term text preservation should be a priority.<br><br><a href=genji-and-printing-press.html#c8938991858364933230 title="comment permalink">3/19/09, 2:19 PM</a><br><br>

Sooner or later, unless we exercise a care and forethought which is seldom evident in the mass of human beings, we shall be left with little more than village or small town economy. It is worth noting, therefore, that the making of books can be a cottage industry. If the need is there, anyone could learn that careful swirl of the tray and flick of the wrist that distributes the pulp evenly over the mesh and gives us handmade paper...<br><br>"I say all this because I sometimes hear people say that the age of the book is past; and I suppose these statements to come from people who have a couple of thousand television sets on their shelves. But it will be a very advanced village industry that can manufacture a television set. Tapes, cassettes, records, radios, television sets are with us, certainly; but he would be a wise man who could predict how long we shall be able to afford them."<br><br>(William Golding, 'A Moving Target', Address to Les Anglicistes, Rouen, 16 May 1976)<br><br>I also recall Ian Sinclair observing that the history of the written word has seen a movement to shorter and shorter-lived media. It's not just that today's digital data is fragile and easily becomes obsolete, the paper on which 20th century paperbacks are printed decays faster than the books of previous centuries, and (he claims) the pattern holds true all the way back to stone tablets.<br><br><a href=genji-and-printing-press.html#c9201973403119907596 title="comment permalink">3/20/09, 6:32 PM</a><br><br>

It's so easy to use, even a child can operate it.<br><br>Compact and portable, it can be used anywhere -- even sitting in an armchair by the fire -- yet it is powerful enough to hold as much information as a CD-ROM disc.<br><br>Here's how it works:<br><br>BOOK is constructed of sequentially numbered sheets of paper (recyclable), each capable of holding thousands of bits of information. The pages are locked together with a custom-fit device called a binder which keeps the sheets in their correct sequence.<br><br>Opaque Paper Technology (OPT) allows manufacturers to use both sides of the sheet, doubling the information density and cutting costs. Experts are divided on the prospects for further increases in information density; for now, BOOKS with more information simply use more pages. Each sheet is scanned optically, registering information directly into your brain. A flick of the finger takes you to the next sheet.<br><br>BOOK may be taken up at any time and used merely by opening it.<br><br>BOOK never crashes or requires rebooting, though, like other devices, it can become damaged if coffee is spilled on it and it becomes unusable if dropped too many times on a hard surface. The "browse" feature allows you to move instantly to any sheet, and move forward or backward as you wish. Many come with an "index" feature, which pin- points the exact location of any selected<br>information for instant retrieval.<br><br>An optional "BOOKmark" accessory allows you to open BOOK to the exact place you left it in a previous session -- even if the BOOK has been closed. BOOKmarks fit universal design standards; thus, a single BOOKmark can be used in BOOKs by various manufacturers. Conversely, numerous BOOK markers can be used in a single BOOK if the user wants to store numerous views at once. The number is limited only by the number of pages in the BOOK. You can also make personal notes next to BOOK text entries with optional programming tools, "Portable Erasable Nib Cryptic Intercommunication Language Styli" (PENCILS). Portable, durable, and affordable, BOOK is being hailed as a precursor of a new entertainment wave. BOOK's appeal seems so certain that thousands of content creators have committed to the platform and investors are reportedly flocking to invest. Look for a flood of new titles soon.</i><br><br>(Thanks for another thoughtful essay - I now find myself anticipating the next installment each week!)<br><br><a href=genji-and-printing-press.html#c9022654643557696968 title="comment permalink">3/20/09, 7:09 PM</a><br><br>

All the more reason for some of us to move further down the curve in advance, and get the next generation technology in place. <br><br>Michael, thanks for the links!<br><br>Isis, depends on the funding base of the university in question. Those few that have stable private sources of funding not dependent on investments may be able to pull through. Public universities, and those private ones that got caught up in bubble economics, are in deep trouble already and for many of them, it will only get worse. It would be good to see librarians at university libraries start thinking about a worst case plan for preserving their most important holdings if their funding goes away entirely and the university they serve is boarded up -- but I'd be amazed if anyone is thinking in those terms yet. <br><br>John, all these are important points.

A couple of titles I'm working with in this area are Leonard Shlain's "The Alphabet Versus the Goddess," and Neal Stephenson's outstanding novel "Snow Crash."<br>As a former typesetter, I think the marriage of computer typesetting and letterpress printing is a match made in heaven; and as custodian of a personal library of over 1,000 volumes, I'm deeply concerned about the issues you've raised. I look forward to more discussions. Thank you.<br>Best wishes,<br>Rick<br><br><a href=genji-and-printing-press.html#c7035288146443964115 title="comment permalink">3/21/09, 7:42 AM</a><br><br>

They burn, they are very sensitive to high humidity and celulose eating animals love them. The ink may not be very durable also. All of this without considering the periodic book burns.....<br><br>-The language where they were written has to survive in some meaningful way. Same for the signal system used in the writing.<br><br>No common people will keep books for more than a generation or two if there isn't anyone that understands the language there. Roman and Greek books survived because there was some people that knew Latin and Greek, in spite of the common people didn't knew anything regarding that. Same for the Chinese counterparts. If people don't understand them, they will simply reuse them ( like the Gnostic Gospels found in Egypt in the the middle of the XX century, that were being used as paper windows ) and they will not last long. Or worse,, they might even survive in perfect fashion, but no one may understand them, even if the alphabet or the language are still alive. I could quote the ever present Mayans or the Easter island writings, but I have to quote a more revealing case: I lived for some years near of a place where it was found some stones written in the Southern Iberian culture. This people had a alphabet of their own, but they sometimes used greek letters ( like Russians use sometimes latin letters, in spite of having the cirilic ). We thus know how the letters were pronounced ( well, with a heavy classical greek accent.... ) and we can even phonetically read the other alphabet writings, but we can't understand what is written there. Pretty much like if the Inuit with latin alphabet became the standart for the Northern America ( with english reduced to almost ( or even being ) a dead language ) and one person knowing that would try to read a english-written novel.... they would be able to recognize the letters, they could even phonetically read the novel ( with inuit accent ), but they wouldn't understand a word ( besides any inuit word imported from english ....)<br><br>- The context of the book theme has to survive in some meaningful way<br><br>If you notice, most of the books that survived the rises and falls of this world were of topics that didn't needed a special formation to understand: love, politics, philosophy, war .... More technical stuff simply disapeard: we have no latin book describing<br>the use of lighter cements in higher parts of cement-made buildings, like we discovered the romans used in the Pantheon, for a quick example. Technical books, as a rule of thumb, don't survive, unless they are related with war ( and even then, we only have a handful of them from the Roman days, like Vegetius, and some more from the chinese counterepart, like Sun Tzu ..... ), and even if they survive, they can be completely useless due to lack of context ( I recall a small novel from a quite a while ago, <i>A Canticle for Leibowitz</i> (I am quite sure that the Archdruid knows it ), where at a certain point two monks were discussing what was Electronics ( the art that Saint Leibowitz used before the atomic war ) and one tells that it was the art of using the Electron, that, according to the only fragment avaliable "was a torsion of the nothing negatively charged". This are completely valid definitions of Electronics and electrons if you put them in the modern days science context ( The ever exotic Quantum mechanics ), but that will not help you a tiny bit in doing a electric engine or a radio, especially if you don't know quantum mechanics ... )<br><br>- The content of the book has to be suficienty useful and not too much dangerous to the governements.<br><br>This is somewhat covered by the other items, but I think it needs a separate explanation.<br><br>Making books is a expensive enterprise ( it might be cheaper per unit than manuscript, but the fact is that, if we use the medieval ratio of 9 farmers/sheppards/fishermen to produce enough to sustain a non-farmer, you'll need 9 farmers/shepards/fishermen working for every person that is working direcly or not ( like the blacksmith or the lumberjack ) in the printing press. That in terms of human society is highly expensive ). This means that Printing press may only survive in a society with a lot of food excedents, and that is the same thing that makes powerful governements viable. The only times where there was a relative free press was when a sociological accident produced a high productive society that didn't had a strong enough governement ( like Gutenberg Germany or the Thirteen colonies ). On more normal times governement has been able to control the press in one way or another. This obviously puts a hard limit on concepts that have a chance to survive printed: for a example, I'm pretty sure that the gospels, with their revolutionary Jesus whipping the Temple sellers or calling Herodes Antipas ( technically his king ) a fox, or with Peter saying loudly to the Jewish authorities that it is more important to please God then men would had been burned a long time ago or simply not recopied/reprinted to oblivion if it wasn't the word of God for the Churches.... and even then there were obviously cuts and inserts in them. The non-sanctioned gospels prove that.... There is also the case of Confucius writings: we don't even know if any of the survivors of the First emperor anti-Confucian rage or the reconstructions made after that have actually any of the original material in it, of if it has, if it wasn't distorted to mean a thing completely diferent of the original meaning.<br><br>Bottom line: the books that are recopied or reprinted most of the times are the ones that are useful enough and not too harmful for the rullers of the time... Don't expect, for a example, that detailed plans of a flying machine <br>survive if the state can't/don't want to control the air ( this already happened in a time with priting press : search for Bartolomeu de Gusmão <i>Passarola</i> )...<br><br>I'm not saying that books are not a good information storage medium in harsh days, but in reliability nothing beats the old master-aprentice relation and the medieval memorization techniques in terms ( there are still some people that use them... my favourite is the walk method: you make a walk while thinking on the things you want to remember, assigning every item to a particular feature of the walk path and when you want to recall it, you make the math mentally until that item... pretty similar to what we do when we don't find the house/car keys. This works well because our brains are better storing images than concepts.... so we tag a mental image of the path with the concepts we want to remember ), because this kind of relationship most of the times also transmits the context of the teached knowledge, a thing that no other medium ( including books ), can do.<br><br>P.S Related to this, a link to a small essay of a self proclaimed "war nerd" regarding the hubris of the persons of falling civilizations, that always think that their fall is the end of the world:<br><br>http://exiledonline.com/war-nerd-apocalypse-never/<br> <br>He's a little truculent, but he's got a point in there.<br><br><a href=genji-and-printing-press.html#c8763188394407900469 title="comment permalink">3/22/09, 7:10 AM</a><br><br>

Even the type of perforated cards used in the 1970s should last longer than the usual paper. Information density can be improved up to the point of (thick) needle piercing, especially if we are just interested in leaving a lot to read for some future generations. To preserve the small holes and strengthen the cards, lamination can be used. Not just cellulose but plastics are usable to make cards (like with the “durable” poker cards) - we heard a lot how purely degradable are plastics in natural environment.<br><br>The binary code for texting can be even read by a trained human eye; half of the ASCII code would be more than enough. Optical magnification of small holes can be made pretty low tech. Simple devices for card reading and teleprompter-type display could be feasible in a low technology world - either using simplest electric circuity, or perhaps purely mechanically.<br><br>Ternary (rather than binary) text coding can be a big helper. One of its beauties is that 3 tribits (ternary bits) can encode 3^3=27 symbols - just enough for the English alphabet and a separator. With 4 tribits you encode 3^4=81 symbols - good for capital and lower case letters, basic punctuation signs and arithmetic symbols. (Plus you can use one symbol to refer to an alternative symbol table.) Ternary perforation is not a problem - you would use two types of holes and a blank. A ternary code would be easier to read to trained humans, because of shorter length and richer patterns. Even theoretically, a ternary system encodes information more efficiently than a binary one - because 3 is closer to exp(1) or something. Who knows, a materially stable ternary computer might be just possible; even 3^9~=20”Kb” RAM would be welcome.<br><br>Music has been already encoded in perforation - you may have seen street organs in some European cities. To encode images economically, the optimally dense hexagonal/triangle grid of pixels can be used instead of the usual square grid.<br><br><a href=genji-and-printing-press.html#c6601346311481826321 title="comment permalink">3/22/09, 7:13 PM</a><br><br>

It should be generally easier to turn parts of the masses against each other, or against some pure scapegoats, than organize them to take informed radical action against the “monopolist” of violence. The elites may have good knowledge of workable tricks.<br><br>Besides, often a distinction should be made between nominal rulers and less obvious elites of various social and economic powers. By the critical time, the former may merely represent a public relations cover of a hidden consistent promotion of special interests of the latter. Whatever happens to the king, essential control of turmoil events may remain in the same hands.<br><br>Even if the elites fall thoroughly, the distribution of the recent knowledge can matter a lot socially. We may forget it at the times of democratic knowledge distribution (especially in science), but generally knowledge “does not” have to be shared publicly. Monopolies of basic knowledge may differentiate the society dramatically. The perspective of attainable slave cheap labour for many generations tempt various kinds of elites and accidental “John Galts” to cooperate like nothing else.<br><br><a href=genji-and-printing-press.html#c5762784293131448791 title="comment permalink">3/22/09, 7:20 PM</a><br><br>

Respectfully, I disagree. Many of the techniques developed for mass production of books (following the acceptance of movable type letterpresses) moved towards faster and faster methods of binding the books, but not necessarily <i>better</i> techniques. There are still books that were bound in, for example, the 12th century that have stood up better to time than those bound in the 18th century. I will agree that 18th century techniques made books more <i>accessible</i>, by producing more books.<br><br>Jacques de Beaufort wrote about production of paper, specifically about shredding the fibers. It's not so much <i>shredding</i> the fibers (despite a commonenough technique used for handmade these days involving the use of a blender). The main goal is to reduce the papers to a really small size. One of the most common techniques for doing this in the past was to use large wooden triphammers, beating the fibers into pulp. Animal power, windmill power, water power, all can be used for mashing up the pulp for the production of paper. Also, it appears that the better source for the fiber for paper-making is worn out clothing, rather than freshly acquired fiber, because a lot of the breakdown process has been accomplished through wear-and-tear.<br><br>As Brian Bost noted, there are still a number of small presses using letterpress printers and movable type. I have more than 40 cases of movable type myself (although currently I only have a tabletop letterpress and a large proof press). There are suppliers for these presses, but I'm not sure anyone is making new ones (most of the ones available for sale are relatively old), and there are limited sources for new type (movable type will eventually wear out). There is an active community of letterpress workers who are attempting to preserve these presses so that they aren't simply reduced to scrap (which many already have been).<br><br>My regular employment requires constant work on computers over the Internet, but there is nothing quite like curling up with a good book of an evening. And if I find an electronic copy of a good book through the Gutenberg Project, I can download it, print it, and bind it myself, to experience the book as it was meant to be enjoyed.<br><br><a href=genji-and-printing-press.html#c7672224540845453917 title="comment permalink">3/23/09, 8:48 AM</a><br><br>

Any microscope<br>adequate for a hospital or a school<br>will do, and no specialized training<br>in deciphering is needed. One inspects<br>the little sliver of microform with any<br>general-purpose microscope - that's a<br>device that embeds no electronics, that<br>does not require even electricity for<br>its operation - and one sees familiar<br>printed words in the eyepiece.<br><br>In fact I somewhat overrepresented the<br>difficulty of the case last time round,<br>by saying that any society which knows<br>how to assemble a pair of lenses into<br>a compound microscope will be able<br>to read microform. What I should have<br>said is that a simple (single-lens), as<br>opposed to a compound (multiple-lens),<br>microscope will do. The practicality of<br>this is demonstrated by microbiology<br>pioneer Antonie van Leeuwenhoek<br>(1632-1723), who made little hand-held<br>single-lens microscopes with simple<br>hand tools. If Leeuwenhoek was able<br>to see individual spermatozoa, then<br>someone imitating or rediscovering his<br>lens-grinding methods will be able <br>to see individual letters in microform.<br><br>In previous postings, I neglected<br>to address the question of<br>climate-controlled storage for a<br>microform archive. A quick check on<br>the Internet reveals that the best<br>contemporary plastic-based microfilms<br>will last for on the order of 500 years<br>or 1000 years if reasonable conditions<br>of temperature and humidity are met. (I<br>guess it is okay to keep the vault<br>at the temperatures of today's Nova<br>Scotia summers, and yet not okay to<br>hazard the temperatures of today's<br>Arizona.) That is not too bad, but I<br>nevertheless in the last few days found<br>that we can do better if we are<br>willing to invest a lot of energy now,<br>when we still have it, in creating<br>metal-plate microform, inscribing the<br>tiny letters with an ion beam. A firm<br>specializing in this technology is<br>Norsam Technologies in the USA, with<br>a writeup - the public Web, which I<br>researched last week, is my sole source<br>of knowledge regarding the firm - at<br>http://www.norsam.com/hdrosetta.htm.<br>Here we find a few paragraphs<br>promoting Norsam's "HD-Rosetta<br>Archival Preservation Services".<br>One "HD-Rosetta" metal plate, about 5<br>cm (2 inches) square, and about 6 mm<br>(1/4 inch) thick, is said on the Norsam<br>Web site to tolerate temperatures as<br>high as 500oC (900oF), to last at least<br>a millennium, and to hold between 5,000<br>and 18,000 pages if the envisaged<br>means of retrieval is the optical<br>microscope. (A much higher pagecount,<br>it is said there, will fit onto a plate<br>if the envisaged means of retrieval<br>is the scanning electron microscope,<br>but all of us on this JMG blog will<br>add that that is not realistic for a<br>post-Peak-Oil information-retrieval<br>scenario.) The Norsam writing machine<br>is said to engrave 7,000 pages on a<br>metal plate in an hour, meaning that<br>a single HD-Rosetta plate will get<br>finished after one has paid Norsam for<br>an hour or two of machine time.<br><br>Since the Norsam ion-beam writer takes<br>digital files, one might imagine<br>some philanthropic soul, such as<br>George Soros, laying out some tens<br>of thousands of dollars to enable at<br>least some portion of the Project<br>Gutenberg open-public-access texts<br>to be read into a Norsam writer,<br>I suppose right within the walls of<br>Norsam Technologies, straight from the<br>Web. So that would be a way of helping,<br>say, Wordsworth and Blake, not to<br>mention Horace and Catullus, survive.<br><br>But I'd also like to put in a special<br>plea for preservation of science. What<br>REALLY has to be kept are (as indeed<br>our host JMG once pointed out in<br>this forum) the books that convey<br>the method, the general approach,<br>the strategy and the tactics and<br>the mental disciplines as opposed<br>to the factoids. I would suggest<br>that in the first instance this<br>means preserving a small shelf of<br>textbooks for the core undergraduate<br>curriculum, selected to embody best<br>international pedagogical practice in<br>the formation of the working scientist.<br>In calculus, we can forget about<br>the rather superficial mathematical<br>cookbooks that are used on ordinary<br>campuses for teaching the ordinary<br>"MATH101" or "MATH201". But we do<br>have to conserve an author like Spivak,<br>who retraces the very thought processes<br>used in developing univariate calculus,<br>ultimately building up to the full<br>rigour of epsilon-delta definitions and<br>complex-plane-proved-to-be-a-field.<br>(Spivak's first-year textbook is<br>used for honours-stream univariate<br>calculus courses in elite schools. I<br>imagine it is the first thing that<br>gets thrown at you if you embark on<br>a four-year programme of pure maths<br>in the Ivy League or at Cambridge.)<br>In physics, we can conserve French and<br>Taylor's MIT introductions to classical<br>mechanics and quantum mechanics, at<br>the North American PHYS200-to-PHYS299<br>level, first and foremost because<br>they retrace in historical detail<br>the repeated <br>transformation of conceptual<br>(philosophical) foundations under<br>the repeated impact of laboratory<br>investigations, but additionally<br>because they have unusually subtle<br>problem sets, with the usual sets<br>of back-of-the-book numerical<br>answers-for-selected-problems.<br><br>Now, continuing to focus on this sector<br>of science, I'll look at pagecount,<br>in each case rounding pagecount to 2<br>significant figures:<br><br>* Spivak _Calculus_, 2nd ed: 650 pp<br>* Spivak _Calculus_ , 2nd, edition, <br> "Answer Book" with worked detailed<br> solutions for problems<br> (line-by-line proofs, <br> with delicious remarks such as <br> "If a more analytical proof is<br> desired, note that the reflection<br> of (a,b) through the antidiagonal<br> is (-b,-a)"): 410 pp<br>* French, _Newtonian Mechanics_, 750 pp <br>* French, _Vibrations and Waves_, 320 pp<br>* French and Taylor, _An Introduction <br> to Quantum Physics_, 670 pp<br>* French, _Special Relativity_, 290 pp <br><br>The total pagecount then comes in<br>at 650+410+750+320+670+290 = 3090<br>pp, or with appropriate rounding<br>3100 pp. That is enough for a single<br>HD-Rosetta plate inscribed with the<br>largest letters (the most easily read<br>letters) emanating from the Norsam<br>ion-beam writer. With the HD-Rosetta<br>plate duly written, that is to say duly<br>engraved, we have a syllabus that makes<br>clear the full thrust of mechanics<br>(outside thermodynamics, admittedly),<br>as it developed from Newton to high<br>Victorian times. Additionally (this<br>is crucial) the conserved syllabus<br>explains the lines of investigation<br>and mental discipline that led to the<br>twentieth-century abandonment of the<br>Newtonian paradigm. The message to<br>our remote descendants can thus be:<br>"Here is how we did Newtonian mechanics<br>from 1650 or so until just after 1900,<br>and here is how we tore it all down,<br>or rather exhibited it as a mere<br>potentially misleading special case, in<br>a big revolution led between 1905 and<br>1930approx by Einstein and the quantum<br>mechanicians: now study our history<br>and see if it guides YOU in asking your<br>OWN questions about physical reality."<br><br>Since monasteries outside the<br>great cities are more durable than<br>universities, and since they already<br>have a tradition of conserving saints'<br>relics and other small-but-valuable<br>bits of property, it might make<br>sense to have such HD-Rosetta plates<br>stored in monasteries. In the USA, one<br>reasonable monastery is the Archabbey<br>of Mount Saint Vincent, founded<br>in 1846. This institution I have<br>visited, and I remain in communications<br>with it as an Oblate Novice. European<br>examples are more impressive still,<br>with St Gall (to take an example;<br>I have not visited) possessing the<br>triple advantages of operation since<br>719 A.D., remoteness from the ocean,<br>and political embedding in the ancient<br>and predominantly stable jurisdiction<br>of Switzerland.<br><br>I would imagine that HD-Rosetta plates<br>would serve as a repository to tide us<br>over if things get temporarily very<br>bad before getting better again. In<br>an era of renaissance, HD-Rosetta<br>plates could be read, perhaps with<br>a mere single-lens Leeuwenhoek-style<br>microscope, by scribes who then either<br>write books out with pens or set type<br>for letterpress.<br><br>Conventional books themselves<br>are not robust enough to keep<br>things going easily if things<br>get very bad, since in non-desert<br>climates they have to get copied<br>and recopied every few centuries,<br>in a race against the decay of paper<br>or parchment. Our Greek and Roman<br>literature comes down to us not from<br>Greek and Roman manuscripts but from<br>copies-of-copies-of-copies, dating not<br>all the way back to antiquity but only<br>to early mediaeval times. Additionally,<br>the energy requirements for keeping<br>a university-scale library of paper<br>books secure against fire and flood,<br>with adequate climate control, are<br>rather high.<br><br>Readers interested in other aspects<br>of library conservation might<br>enjoy the discussions on this blog<br>http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com,<br>under the JMG postings for 2008-05-14<br>("The Same New Ideas") and 2008-05-28<br>("Why Decline Matters"). Somewhere<br>in those discussions, I made a few<br>postings, drawing attention to a few<br>other points that I will not elaborate<br>here - for instance, to the conceivable<br>relevance of international cooperation<br>under the aegis of UNESCO or of the<br>folks at http://www.ifla.org/.<br><br><br>Sincerely, <br>in great gratitude to everyone<br>for raising, once again, <br>the centrally important topic <br>of book conservation, <br><br><br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo<br>verbum at interlog dot com<br>http://www.metascientia.com<br><br><a href=genji-and-printing-press.html#c1475396678765834606 title="comment permalink">3/24/09, 11:38 AM</a><br><br>

We are faced with a incredible mass of published materials and even in more main stream area,like fiction, people are not accointed anymore with the landmarks of literature. Bookclubs and medias read and dissect the latest offerings on the shelves but dont read or discuss Mark Twain, Melville, Tolstoi etc...<br><br>In every fields its getting harder to find copies of the 'classics'. Online shopping is giving us a bit of a respite, but I remember vividly hunting second hand bookstores and librairies in search of some elusive book which should never have fallen in the out-of-print category. Visit most bookstores and ask for Sinclair's Babbit, Cervantes's short stories or Darwin's Formation of vegetable mould, and they will give you a puzzled look. The Harry Potter craze took me by surprise because all in all, it is rather badly written and it is not original. In retrospect, it made sense because the mainstream media and the public are not accointed anymore with the masterpieces of the Fantasy genre or any others, for that matter. I dont say that somebody must read only the great classics, but at least some of them. <br><br>We would like to think that it is different for specialists in medical, scientific or social sciences, but many wont look at literature older than five years. During undergrad studies, important ideas of the discipline will be covered briefly and then forgotten due to lack of use later on. One of the thing I appreciate most with JMG blog is his reference to key authors such as Toynbee. <br><br>Triage can be also a painful exercise. When budget and space are limited, what do you pick? Your favorite, albeight not the greatest author, say P.G. Wodehouse, or somebody less accessible, but more important, like Thomas Mann?<br><br><a href=genji-and-printing-press.html#c7194902970205266139 title="comment permalink">3/25/09, 10:52 AM</a><br><br>

I worry, given the coming contraction in resources and population, that the greater challenge may be preserving literacy on any widespread and useful scale. Unlike a spoken language, the symbols and grammar of reading and writing must be consciously taught and practiced to be learned. That may be a luxury as we lurch down the slope to a sustainable human population and whatever level of social organization that results. If literacy becomes a skill confined to a succession of social elites then what is preserved or destroyed, and learned, will be based on their immediate priorities. Or literacy in current languages may be lost altogether.<br>Are there any strategies that might keep reading accessible and useful to people struggling to survive? Perhaps publishing durable books of simple stories with straightforward language and illustrations, or practical knowledge, diagrams of useful implements and machines with basic descriptions? People will tell stories and pass along useful knowledge orally in any case, so what will make books worth the effort to keep and read? The mental image I have is of a group of people somewhere in the future uncovering a collection of books, somehow preserved. Will they recognize them from their own well worn volumes or consider them another curious object from the “before times”, best used now as fuel for fire?<br><br><a href=genji-and-printing-press.html#c3878963910513232561 title="comment permalink">3/25/09, 12:33 PM</a><br><br>

Photography is a relatively simple technology, compared to chip fabrication, and while exceptional optics are difficult to fabricate, people have been making glass lenses since the Middle Ages and photographic records since the early 1800s. The UN used to offer a portable fiche reader and a library of technical and literary 'standards' that fit in a shoe box for under $300 back in the 80s. It was meant for educational use in poor third-world countries, which I am afraid is where we are headed.<br><br><a href=genji-and-printing-press.html#c3091965578819852761 title="comment permalink">4/10/09, 12:09 PM</a><br><br>
