Whether or not synchronicity has the importance that Jung and his physicist friend Wolfgang Pauli attributed to it, it’s something that pops into my life often enough to be worth the occasional comment. A couple of weeks ago, a fine specimen showed up – well, not quite on my doorstep, but in the course of a half mile or so of walking that began and ended there.<br><br>My walk that day took me to the post office, to pick up a package, and to the local media exchange, to see what was new there. I’m not sure how widespread media exchanges are just now, but it’s an intriguing business model: people drop off the books, CDs, DVDs, and so on they no longer want; those that are worth $10 or more on the used book market get sold over the internet, and the rest go on shelves, for anyone to take for free. This particular media exchange gets a dizzying assortment of stuff; for that matter, so does my mailbox. <br><br>This particular day had parallel finds in both of them. The mailbox contained the first two copies of my new book on the UFO phenomenon, rather unoriginally titled <a href="http://www.llewellyn.com/bookstore/book.php?pn=H319"><i>The UFO Phenomenon</i></a>, an attempt to get past sixty years of bickering between the people who think any light in the sky nobody can identify must be an alien spacecraft, and the people who think that any light in the sky nobody can identify never existed in the first place. The media exchange followed that up with a packet of yellowing paper putting a full stop at the end of one of the oddest and, in its own way, most moving stories I researched in the course of writing <i>The UFO Phenomenon</i>.<br><br>The late Dorothy Martin never became a household name, but this is mostly because she had her fifteen minutes of fame veiled by a pseudonym. She was "Marion Keech," the central figure in the UFO cult chronicled in one of the classics of American sociology, <i>When Prophecy Fails</i>. Martin, a suburban Chicago housewife turned contactee, announced to the world that a vast flood would sweep over North America on December 21, 1954, and only those who were flown to safety aboard flying saucers would survive. <br><br>A team of sociologists from the University of Minnesota had a couple of grad students join Martin's circle under false pretenses. The result was one of the few hour-by-hour accounts of what happens when a group of true believers has to deal with the complete failure of their belief system. The climactic scene of the story, the afternoon when a circle of middle Americans gathered in a suburban backyard in a Midwestern winter, watching the skies and frantically getting rid of every scrap of metal on their bodies so the flying saucers could land safely, begs for cinematic treatment; it's hard to imagine any series of events more perfectly balanced on the thin edge between drama and farce.<br><br>It's hard to get through a degree in any of the social sciences in America without being exposed to <i>When Prophecy Fails</i>, but very few people know the rest of the story. Friends in the contactee scene got Martin out of Chicago just ahead of a psych evaluation that probably would have sent her to a mental institution, and she went first to Arizona and then to Peru, where a group of contactees were attempting to launch the Abbey of the Seven Rays as an international center for the emerging New Age movement. When the Abbey folded, the promoters simply walked away, leaving Martin penniless and stranded. <br><br>It took her years to get back to the United States. When she finally made it home, she settled in the small town of Mount Shasta, California as Sister Thedra, the name she believed she had been given by the aliens. With a constancy and devotion worthy of some less delusional creed, she lived in relative poverty, supported by donations from the very modest network of people who subscribed to her newsletter and found her messages appealing, and devoted all her time and efforts to the task of preaching the extraterrestrial gospel to a mostly uninterested world. Until her death in 1992, she remained convinced that the purifying catastrophes and mass alien landings she had announced in 1954 were still imminent.<br><br>The packet of aging photocopies I found at the media exchange chronicled the last chapters of her story: several years' worth of her newsletter from the last years of her life, along with a cheaply bound book of messages she had transcribed from the aliens and a brief biography of Martin written just after her death by one of her few followers. I brought it home and read the whole packet several times. It will be going back to the media exchange, but several aspects of her story seem uncomfortably relevant to the current predicament of the industrial world.<br><br>To begin with, of course, a remarkable number of people even today remain committed to the same faith in flying saucers that led Dorothy Martin on the long strange trip of her life. I have had several conversations with one person who is convinced that since the problems besetting industrial society are insoluble by rational means, we need to transcend reason and await rescue by spiritually enlightened extraterrestrials. (It never fails to bewilder me how many people these days think that "transcend" and "give up on" mean the same thing.) I have spoken with another person who, having seen odd lights in the sky, is convinced that they must have been alien spacecraft, and on that basis argues that since it's clearly possible for intelligent species to reach a higher technological level than humanity, humanity ought to be able to get through its present predicament and keep on progressing.<br><br>All this is a bit like insisting that any hoofprint sighted in a forest anywhere on Earth proves the reality of unicorns, and arguing from there that the best solution to the current health care crisis is to rely on the legendary curative power of unicorn horns. Still, Martin's legacy has a broader lesson to teach. The contactee faith that shaped her career drew its strength from the appalling contradiction between the ideology of progress that dominated twentieth century America and a growing sense that the trajectory being traced by progress was moving toward a future no sane person would welcome. The slogan of the 1933 Chicago World's Fair – "Science Explores, Technology Executes, Mankind Conforms" – had become the ideology of an inhuman future anatomized by Jacques Ellul in <i>The Technological Society</i> and also, in the sly language of satiric fantasy, by C.S. Lewis in his novel <i>That Hideous Strength</i>. <br><br>The result invites analysis in terms of Gregory Bateson's theory of the double bind. Put a child into a family setting where the realities that can be discussed flatly contradict the realities the child experiences, Bateson pointed out, and mental illness is a pretty common result. Put an entire society into the same sort of conflict between ideology and experience, and new belief systems that promise a radical resolution of the conflict spring up. The more drastic the disconnection between culturally acceptable beliefs and personal experiences becomes, the wilder and more apocalyptic the resulting belief systems tend to be.<br><br>There's an entire literature on revitalization movements, which is what sociologists call the mass movements that sometimes gather around these new belief systems in times of drastic social stress. Some dimensions of the UFO movement came close to that category, though it never quite managed to become a mass movement on the scale of the Ghost Dance of the Native American plains tribes, say, or other classic examples of the type. The social pressures that gave rise to the extraterrestrial faith found other expressions before that faith could find a large following; the widespread but mild belief that there could well be aliens out there somewhere, and there might be something to all those reports of flying saucers, replaced the total conviction that sent Dorothy Martin in pursuit of her destiny. <br><br>Just now, though, the double bind that drove the radical movements of the Fifties and Sixties – the gaping disparity between the Utopian visions of progress that flooded popular culture and the manipulative and inhumane technocracy so many people saw taking shape around them – has given way to a different one. Where the stresses of an earlier time grew from contradictions to the claim that progress is good, those of the present and foreseeable future are building around the claim that progress is inevitable. A society founded on the unquestioned belief that economic expansion and technological development will continue forever may have a very, very hard time dealing with a future in which economic contraction and the abandonment of technologies too complex to be sustainable will likely be dominant trends. It's not too far of a reach, it seems to me, to suggest that massive revitalization movements will follow.<br><br>Not all of those will be as obviously delusional as Dorothy Martin's belief in the imminent arrival of the Space Brothers, though there will doubtless be some, and the approaching "end of the Mayan calendar" in 2012 – I put the phrase in quotes, because the Mayan calendar doesn't end then, and the recently invented mythology that has gathered around the rollover of one of their calendrical cycles has no basis whatsoever in ancient Mayan tradition – may well give rise to a whopper. Still, it's the apparently saner fantasies that may cause the most damage, if only by distracting us from steps that can actually be taken to cushion the descent into the deindustrial age and make life better for our descendants for generations to come.<br><br>Thus I'd encourage my readers to be at least a little wary of any movement in the years to come, however reasonable and hopeful it may seem, that claims to have a solution to the rising spiral of crises that is building around today's industrial civilization. I have argued here and elsewhere that those crises define a predicament rather than a problem – a situation that cannot be solved, only lived with – but that definition flies in the face of some of the most deeply rooted assumptions of our culture. I suspect that unless we cultivate an unusual degree of common sense, a great many of us in the years to come may end up doing some equivalent of standing in suburban backyards, waiting for the saucers to arrive.

But I believe in a lot of stuff for a little while, never religiously.<br><br>Anyways, I found a great Joseph Tainter audio file and uploaded it to youtube. You can find it <a href=http://jacquesdebeaufort.blogspot.com/2009/03/joseph-tainter-collapse-of-complex.html rel=nofollow>here</a>. He refers to Byzantium as an example of the only society he knows of that has ever self-consciously simplified and contracted in an orderly manner.<br><br>Re-reading Tainter recently it was interesting to find him very disdainful of the "mystical" approach of both Spengler and Toynbee. I wonder if you find his criticism compelling, or more indicative of his methodology as a "social anthropologist" ?<br><br><a href=#c2157470789991226794 title="comment permalink">3/12/09, 12:10 AM</a><br><br>

I recently posted several lectures on the importance of dealing with emotional denials in the face of rapidly changing conditions. One example of the problems which will rise will be a constant slowing of our ability to express our individualism simply because affording to do so will diminish. This will force us all to spend more time around those we are emotionally closest .... and that includes family and neighbors we do not get along with as well as the ones we do. Our little escapes will become harder to fund which will add pressure to the strains of change, as well. It will be a time of "doorstep sweeping" in many ways people do not expect, I'm sure.<br><br>spottedwolf<br><br><a href=#c8033063314310958559 title="comment permalink">3/12/09, 12:58 AM</a><br><br>

I think one of the most annoying and distracting phenomenon we will have to endure in the coming cultural sea-change will be a deluge of neo-messianic assault all about us. The web could fairly crackle with hot new "garden paths" to doom or salvation requiring our immediate exploration.<br> Speaking of the web, it is sure to rank high among the overly complicated and ruinously energy draining sink pits of the future. I expect a return to something approaching the per-minute usage which early on was a financial and space requirement. Some sort of use rationing might be needed as a survival mechanism for the very system in the not to distant future. <br> It has always made me curious re: UFO's how, if they are real, do they manage to zip about merrily in our atmosphere without the usual penalty of exceeding the speed of sound: making a terrible racket? And, if they are truly as advanced as distance travel would indicate, they would likely be good little Ethnologists and avoid detection at all cost so they could observe us without influencing our behavior.<br><br><a href=#c1957031875017113443 title="comment permalink">3/12/09, 2:06 AM</a><br><br>

Long-time reader of your blog. I don't usually like to comment, but I was charmed to see Jung and Bateson invoked together, so I read this post with even more attention than I usually do.<br><br>Your <i>Long Descent</i> is on my wishlist, and I feel sure I must read it as a necessary antidote to Kunstler's <i>Long Emergency</i> before I attempt your UFO book.<br><br>I don't know what <i>The UFO Phenomenon</i> is about, but I am surprised that your appraisal of the ufology landscape is so black and white, even though it is certainly true that the field is dominated by True Believers and convinced naysayers. I suspect you were just being rhetorical.<br><br>And I suspect, having read much of your blog, that your new book is an interesting excursion into uncharted territory.<br><br>I am not a ufologist; I have read only Jacques Vallee. But over the years I have saved the titles of UFO-related books that I find strangely alluring. Surely you must be familiar with some of them.<br><br>Favourites are:<br><br><i>Ufology Considered as an Evolving System of Paranoia</i>;<br><br><i>Believing the Unbelievable: Child's Play or Con Game</i>;<br><br><i>Signals of Transcendence: The Human-UFO Equation</i>; and<br><br><i>Quicksilver in Twilight: A Close Encounter With a Hermetic Eye</i>.<br><br><a href=#c3510239855458583115 title="comment permalink">3/12/09, 4:14 AM</a><br><br>

I think it is merging with Evangelical "end times" beliefs, and will very soon become widely believed as the date for the Second Coming. When I mention to them that 100 generations of christians, including Jesus himself, believed their generation would be the last, and so far they've all been wrong, I just get blank stares. Plus mentioning that, as I understand it, 2012 is the "end of time" in the same way that December 31 is the "end of the year" and it just cycles again, earns me a new round of blank stares. <br><br>I think we saw a small taste of the revitalization phenom in the last election. The widespread belief that one man, a professional, baked-in-to-the-bone politician, would lead a rejuvenation of American society, economy, and vitality single-handedly certainly leans this way. Don't misnderstand, I voted for the man because I thought he would be the best choice as a politician (and I would rather spend four or eight years hearing his voice on the radio than the alternative), and he represented a symbolic repudiation of the policies of the last administration. But government and politics follow society, economics, and culture, they don't lead it. We will have a rejuvenated government when we have a rejuvenated culture and economy, not the other way around. As the hot dog vendor said to the Buddhist in the rebound punchline of the well-worn joke, "Change comes from within."<br><br><a href=#c2698317159017901275 title="comment permalink">3/12/09, 5:59 AM</a><br><br>

If part of the problem we face is how we will be able to survive the decline of our technological-industrial society with humanity, dignity and resourcefulness, couldn't the new religions offer - along with all of their usual funky cultural trappings - different ways of acquiring correct vision, correct perception, or correct seeing as a way to resolve the double bind? I don't know if I am being clear here; but it seems to me that "living with the problem" demands not only radical changes in behavior (how we do things), but how we think and how we see things (perspective). These revitalizing movements may provide alternative approaches to seeing the world, with new myths, new insights into reality, that others may well consider to be insane. After all, isn't that the state of quite a few marginal and alternative spiritualities in the present day?<br><br><a href=#c8765567879017767924 title="comment permalink">3/12/09, 6:59 AM</a><br><br>

Tainter's right, or nearly so, about Byzantium -- we might learn a few things from them. <br><br>Spotted Wolf, good. The invention of the cult of individualism was a central part of the abandonment of a communitarian society for a mass society; as communities become necessary again, a lot of habits are going to have to change. <br><br>Robert, my guess is that the Messiah-of-the-Month Club will be frantically oversubscribed in the years to come. You're quite right about the web; it uses too much energy, directly and indirectly, to be sustainable for the long haul. Use it while it's here. <br><br>Martin, I'm something of a fan of Jacques Vallee as well -- <i>Messengers of Deception</i> in particular had a significant influence on my book. I don't think my approach is particularly black and white. That being said, I found no evidence worth mentioning that there are alien spacecraft in Earth's skies; what I found was a powerful cultural narrative that's been applied, sometimes as deliberate disinformation, to many different phenomena. <br><br>Bill, I voted for him, too, but the Messianic fantasies that sprang up around him aren't exactly a good sign. I'd like to think that someday we'll outgrow the habit of fantasizing that somebody or something else will relieve us of the hard necessity to change our own lives, but I don't expect it in less than evolutionary time scales. <br><br>Professor, yes, you're being clear, and of course in some sense you're preaching to the choir -- after all, as a Druid I belong to a minority faith dismissed by many people as a bunch of tree-hugging wackos, with its own distinctive ways of trying to reshape the way people approach their lives and interactions with nature! One point worth noting, though, is that the term "revitalization movement" is not a general label for any kind of alternative spirituality; it's the specific sort of mass movement that arises under conditions of extreme social stress, and proclaims an apocalyptic change after which existing cultural beliefs will make sense of the world once again. Rather than offering ways to shift beliefs to fit changing conditions, these movements try to convince themselves that the conditions will change to fit beliefs that are too emotionally important for their followers to give up. <br><br>Michael, start with a couple of serious recent histories of Mayan civilization -- <i>A Forest of Kings</i> by Linda Schele and David Freidel is a good place to start. Then read the Books of Chilam Balam -- at least three of them are in English translation, and they're the best original sources for Mayan calendrics. I don't know of a book that compares the 2012 nonsense to the realities of the Mayan calendar, which is unfortunate -- somebody with a decent background in Mayan studies ought to write one, not least because the story of how Terence McKenna and Jose Arguelles invented the 2012 business out of whole cloth is well worth telling. <br><br>Hapibeli, "trust in saucers but keep your garden tilled," eh?<br><br><a href=#c4583252641559377931 title="comment permalink">3/12/09, 8:41 AM</a><br><br>

I don't think the rules of thermodynamics are going to be changed anytime soon in this universe and so preparing for low tech low energy future is envitable. I am however leaving the door open for a new understanding to potentially emerge. Perhaps it is no more than the mythological understanding of universal truths that some of our ancestors had. <br><br>What if though there is the potential for an even deeper more comprehensive,revealed understanding of our universe and our place in it? Perhaps this breakneck exponential spread of information via the net is merely the incubation period required to cultivate this emerging knowledge.<br><br>Or maybe the internet is just a medium to spread revealed knowledge.<br><br>I don't know, but for whatever reason I can't shake the notion that humans have been seeking some elusive revelatory knowledge that is core to us.

And what a wide range of ideas this post calls forth from me.<br><br>Regarding 2012, I think I disagree with you, though I'm not sure I entirely understand your postition on the whole matter. Just like deindustrialization, the "end" of the Mayan calendar, which you accurately depicted, is not an end of anything other than a cycle. Is it happening at the same time as deindustrialization and the profound impacts that that process will have on our consciousness? You tell me. I think it is. i sure won't be on a rooftop awaiting transcendance on december 21 2012, though. <br><br>Like the UFO phenomenon, the real significance is in the deeper pictoral metaphors of 2012. Both of those depict something that is happening within people. And what happens within people happens without (which by the way is the perspective from which the Mayan Calendar was written). Real or not is hardly the argument to be having. Though I do see your point in encouraging your readers to avoid anouncements of solutions.

Was interested in the inclusion of Jung's insights into this post, along with C.S. Lewis. I seem to recall that Jung, by the end of his life, had an "allergy" to any and all mass-movements and recommended that we should, too. Given the deep discomfort most feel being outsiders in their society, that's not easy advice to take.

It's still right where it's always been -- at the core of ourselves, accessible by each individual who is willing to make the commitment and do the work. I don't see any sign that more people are doing that today than did it a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand years ago. <br><br>Mat, it's certainly true that great changes in society tend to be heralded by a spike in the popularity of apocalyptic fantasies -- look at the relationship of the Millerites to the runup to the American Civil War, for instance. That doesn't mean the fantasies can be taken at face value. They're the collective equivalent of dream images; it's what they signify, not what they seem to be saying overtly, that matters. <br><br>Clarke, Jung got to see first hand how a mass movement that, to many people, looked very promising in its early years could turn metastatic and spiral down to madness and mass murder. His point remains valid today. <br><br>Jay, repeating dreams like that are worth heeding, but they're most often symbolic rather than literal. JRR Tolkien, throughout his life, was haunted by a recurring dream of a great wave rising up and sweeping over everything -- you can find it echoed all through his fiction. It's a very good metaphor for the way the society into which he was born was washed away by the 20th century's waves of change, but a literal prophecy? Not at all. <br><br>Todd, yes, I figure that December 22, 2012 will dawn roughly the same way January 2, 2000 did. <br><br>Megan, exactly -- in the language of the old mystery schools, the planes are discrete, not continuous, and attempts to read mythic symbols as historical events are a fertile source of absolute nonsense. <br><br>Gordonsson, I've noticed that people who start by saying that we should be open to the possibility of game-changing events very quickly move to assuming that one will come along and bail us out of the consequences of our mistakes. I think it's wiser to assume that we're going to have to lie in the bed we've made, and make our plans on that basis; if something happens to bail us out, we can change course at that point. <br><br>Evn, many thanks!<br><br>Bill, no, this is a bit more than that -- there's a cycle of 13 baktuns that takes around 5125 years to complete, or 1/5 of the precessional cycle, and that's what's coming to an end in 2012. Still, there's only one classic Maya inscription that mentions the upcoming end of the 13th baktun at all, and it doesn't make a big deal out of it. Assuming that the world is going to be transformed when it rolls over is a bit like assuming that your beat-up Toyota is going to turn into a Rolls Royce when its odometer next says 0000000. <br><br>Fed Up, I've been reading Arguelles' work since he was a professor at Evergreen State College, and I'm quite familiar with it. You might also want to reread my comment; I didn't say he stole anything, I said that he and Terence McKenna between them invented the current 2012 mythology out of whole cloth, and I stand by that. Yes, I've also read Gilliland's work. <br><br>As for your other comments, I'm quite aware that there are people who disagree forcefully with my Druid beliefs, and not all of them are poorly informed about those beliefs. Some have assessed my ideas in detail, and decided that they think I'm wrong. That's where I stand with regard to the current crop of 2012 believers. Mind you, I'm sure they return the favor -- and that's fine; a monoculture of ideas is as deadly as any other kind of monoculture.<br><br><a href=#c6979430906255997739 title="comment permalink">3/13/09, 9:00 PM</a><br><br>

The timing looks increasingly like it is about right – that is, for rather big and perhaps unpleasant changes to the current economic system, which I suppose is most people’s world.<br><br>Now, don’t get me wrong, not only does coincidence happen, but, given the infinite range of things that can happen and our (unsurprising) tendency to notice only those that effect us, coincidence has a rather large role in our lives: In other words, it is just coincidence, we noticed the one calendar that had a major period end event about the time it was fairly obvious our system would be highly stressed.<br><br>But still, I suspect a lot of people are going to be spooked by that little example of synchronicity.<br><br>And of course I’m going to bicker with part, but only part of your statement that:<br><br>“A society founded on the unquestioned belief that economic expansion and technological development will continue forever may have a very, very hard time dealing with a future in which economic contraction and the abandonment of technologies too complex to be sustainable will likely be dominant trends. It's not too far of a reach, it seems to me, to suggest that massive revitalization movements will follow.”<br><br>Well, I would bicker with that, wouldn’t I?<br><br>In short, I don’t think that economic contraction is necessarily tightly bound to a contraction in technology. Yes, a change in emphasis (people want different stuff) and a contraction in volume, but not necessarily a contraction in scope or technological ability. At least, that is, as long as anything like our current “flat world” one world market survives.<br><br>Yes, given the more or less complete collapse of trade, or an economic contraction so severe that world GDP was reduced to a tiny fraction of its current value, then some technologies may be in trouble, but I consider both scenarios pretty unlikely in the short to medium term.<br><br>Even then, I suspect more would survive that one would at first expect, including particularly a perhaps trimmed down “Internet Light”.<br><br>UFOs, or rather IFOs<br><br>Speaking of synchronicity and coincidence, I once saw one of the rarer and more speculator UFOs. The weird thing is that just a week or so before I saw it I had read about the phenomenon and what actually causes it for the first and only time in my life.<br><br>Knowing what I was actually looking at, after a moment’s confusion, somehow made it even better, almost better than if real aliens had been involved.

Still, I think there's a bit of a difference between "this has happened many times before and so might happen again," which is what I'm trying to say, and "this has never happened before, and we have no evidence that it will happen this time, either, but we're all going to believe that it will happen very soon." <br><br>Otse, thanks for the story! For my part, I think a nobler pursuit might consist of spending the time between now and 2012 learning to garden and get by with less, but to each their own. <br><br>Jacques, yes, it was Plato. I'd rather read his stuff than McKenna's any day, too. <br><br>Mat, the thing I'd point out is that in the Mayan concept of time, every moment is the beginning and ending of a cycle, and has its own unique qualities of time. So is every day, 260-day ritual cycle, year, 20-year katun, and so on. That's the point that the 2012 believers miss -- there's nothing special about their pet date that isn't also special about every single moment.<br><br><a href=#c8565531708540326030 title="comment permalink">3/17/09, 9:08 PM</a><br><br>

The best perspective they've had on the "UFO ENIGMA" in a very long time. Too many are living in the false black/white paradigm, it always has to be one or the other, yet the middle ground is never presented which is the truer path. A lot of people, either confused, poorly researched, or too self-involved, only explore one avenue of the extreme; it's simply easier that way and requires less thought &amp; originality. There's very little valid debate or discussion on these topics, and unfortunately sensationalism is what sells... Noone wants to be human. They want to be superior and believe they're part of some lost alien ancestry that's going to come and reclaim them someday. Somehow, UFO's building the pyramids is all that makes sense to them...<br><br>Anyway...<br><br>Best wishes,<br>~mad<br>www.upsidebackwards.info<br><br><a href=#c464679192593815 title="comment permalink">3/19/09, 12:05 AM</a><br><br>

The sadness isn't for the suffering and madness and destructive thrashing about that will ensue but rather for the sheer lack of necessity.<br> Good men told me well over half a century ago that we could not live on the mother without showing respect. They were right and as I have grown I have come to see this and live my life with respect for earth. <br>Millions of my generational brothers and sisters came to this respect as well. Millions.....<br>And we still managed to get to this state. <br>A seed has lived on, from out of the past, and with what time I have left I will nourish that seed.<br><br>Blink. The internet, entertainment center as it has become will I'm sure have a limited lifespan. However, a reversion to a low voltage 1980's technology of the copper twisted pairs, and preconfigured burst packets can be quite supportable for a long time. In the 60's I lived in Alberta on an 22 mile single uninsulated wire telephone line that must have supported 10 families, and I believe they strung that line in 1944. All on a 6 VDC battery and a hand crank dynamo. My point is that for information and inteligence purposes networking can survive quite nicely for a long time.<br><br>My mind inevitably drifts towards Walter Millers great book, "A Canticle for Leibowitz".
