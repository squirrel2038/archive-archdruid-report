When people talk about the role of technology in the future, most of the time the technologies they have in mind are the flashy ones – that is, those that haven’t been around long enough to slip into the background texture of everyday existence. Especially in periods of decline, though, it’s far more likely to be the technologies so common they’re hardly noticed that determine, by their survival or disappearance, the fate of societies.<br><br>For the Polynesian inhabitants of Easter Island, for example, deepwater canoes had been part of daily life for thousands of years. This, I suspect, is among the core reasons that nobody on Easter Island seems to have anticipated the consequences of cutting down too many trees. The resulting deforestation eliminated an essential resource – large tree trunks – without which deepwater canoes could not be made, cutting off the majority of the island’s food supply and, at the same time, the only way out of the trap the Easter Islanders set for themselves. The canoe had been so omnipresent a part of life for so long that the possibility of its absence very likely never entered into the islanders’ darkest dreams.<br><br>A similar sort of inattention, according to the medieval Arab historian ibn Khaldûn, played a catastrophic role in the collapse and abandonment of cities across the Middle East and North Africa in the centuries prior to his own time. The <i>Muqaddimah</i>, ibn Khaldûn’s treatise on the forces that shape history, paid close attention to the relationship between settled agricultural civilizations and nomadic herding societies. It’s a relationship worth watching; as far back as ancient Sumer, which in historical terms is pretty much as far back as you can go, the ebb and flow of power between desert herdspeople and settled agriculturalists sets the heartbeat of history. In Mesopotamia and many other places, civilizations rise on the backs of new technologies, prosper and expand at the expense of their nomadic neighbors, transmit their technical skills to those same neighbors, and then falter and collapse beneath nomad incursions.<br><br>What sets ibn Khaldûn’s analysis apart from those of the many other historians who once tracked this cycle is his attention to the role of background technologies in bringing the cycle to an end. From Sumerian times onward, irrigation canals formed the backbone of settled life across the Middle East. While irrigation in a desert setting can cause salinization (the slow buildup of salts in the soil), this does not happen as automatically or as disastrously as some current theorists insist; it’s rarely mentioned, for example, that Syria – where grain agriculture was probably invented, and has certainly been practiced as long as anywhere else in the world – is still a significant exporter of wheat today. Two other factors less often discussed in modern studies of ecological history played at least as large a role.<br><br>The first of these, and over the long term the most important, is climate change. Over the ten thousand years or so since the end of the last ice age, climates have shifted dramatically many times over large areas of the world, and rarely so drastically as in the Middle East. The ice age climate spread deserts over much of the world, including areas that now receive plenty of rainfall, while a few regions that are now barren – for example, the Great Basin deserts in North America – got heavy rains and supported rich ecosystems and human societies. The chaotic climates that followed the breakup of the glaciers, and likely made the lives of our ancestors all too interesting, eventually gave way to what paleoclimatologists call the Holocene Climatic Optimum, a period of several thousand years in which global temperatures were much warmer and wetter than they are today. <br><br>During those years, the winter rains that now fall north of the Mediterranean swept across it to douse North Africa, and tropical monsoons rolled north into today’s deserts from Ethiopia to Pakistan. As recently as 6000 years ago, as a result, hippopotami flourished in a great chain of lakes across what is now the southern Sahara Desert, and further north the lakes and marshes gave way to a vast savanna full of giraffes, gazelles, lions, and elephants. Similar conditions prevailed over large parts of the Arabian peninsula and across the band of deserts that now stretch from Mesopotamia east to India.<br><br>What dried up the lakes and replaced savannas with sand dunes was the gradual cooling of the Earth’s climate, which shifted the rain bands toward their present locations, leaving deserts in their wake. Whole river systems vanished, along with the people who once lived beside them, as the rain that once fed both went away. The process took time – as late as the heyday of the Roman Empire, for example, North Africa still received winter rains and remained the Mediterranean’s major grain-producing area – but by ibn Khaldûn’s time it was essentially complete. This was where the third factor, central to his own analysis, came into play. <br><br>The cyclic interaction between settled urban societies and desert nomads depended on the maintenance of irrigation technologies first put into place by the ancient Sumerians. The slow march of climate change made irrigation more difficult and more necessary at the same time, and most desert civilizations had to direct a fair proportion of their economic output into maintaining the canals and waterworks on which survival depended. This, as ibn Khaldûn pointed out, became their Achilles’ heel, because the desert nomads who conquered the urban centers never quite grasped the necessity of the irrigation systems, and starved them of resources until they slid down the slow curve of failure. Like the deforestation that doomed the people of Easter Island, the abandonment of the irrigation canals was a one-way ticket to collapse; once farmland turned into desert, the agricultural wealth that made canal building and repair possible was no longer there to be spent, and regions that had been settled for millennia turned into deserts spotted with crumbling ruins. <br><br>All this has more than a little relevance to the twilight of the industrial age beginning around us today. Like the inhabitants of Easter Island, we depend on the reckless exploitation of limited resources to sustain our way of life; like the civilizations of the Middle East whose fate was chronicled by ibn Khaldûn, our survival depends on fragile infrastructure systems that few of us understand and most of our leaders seem entirely willing to starve of necessary resources for the sake of short-term political advantage. The industrial system that supports us has been in place long enough that most of us seem to be unable to conceive of circumstances in which it might no longer be there.<br><br>One of the wrinkles of catabolic collapse – the process by which societies in decline cannibalize their own infrastructure to meet immediate needs, and so accelerate their own breakdown – is that it can trigger abrupt crises by wrecking some essential technology that is not recognized as such. We are already witnessing the early stages of exactly such a crisis. What large trees were to the Easter Islanders and irrigation canals were to the early medieval Middle East, the current form of money economy is to modern industrial society, and the speculative delusions that passed for financial innovation over the last few decades have played exactly the same role as the invading nomads of ibn Khaldûn’s history, by stripping a fragile system of resources in the pursuit of immediate gain. The result, just as in the 1930s, is that a nation still relatively rich in potential resources, and provided with a large and skilled labor force, is sliding into crushing poverty because the intricate social system we use to allocate labor and resources has broken down.<br><br>Other unwelcome surprises along the same lines are likely events in the future. Before we get there, however, those of us who are concerned about the possible downside of history might be well advised to pay more attention to the unnoticed technologies in our lives, and to start thinking about how to make do without them, or get some substitute in place in a hurry, if the unthinkable happens and one or more of them suddenly goes away.

For example, in the 30s, at least 20% of the population was farming, now it is about 2%. <br>The financial resources are not trickling down to the labor. For example, it is forecast that even if we are at an historical low for word grain reserve (less than 60 days), farmers will probably plant less in 2009 because there is no money available to buy fuel, seed and fertilizers. And there is no policies to change the fundamental of the present agrosystem. Methink that the transition from industrial farming to organic, sustainable farming wont be smooth at all and that there will be some serious hardships ahead (food shortage).<br><br><a href=#c7679138139079376309 title="comment permalink">2/19/09, 6:59 AM</a><br><br>

Many of the current contingency of so-called survivalists see such as the "writing on the wall" as do others under the fanatical religious blanket. The ostensible approach of your own well hones the point by its pragmatic reason.<br><br>I have made decisions for the past 38 years based on such analogies. Included, but certainly not limited to, was the decision to relocate to my birthright, Canada, in hopes of lessening the danger of shortages in large populated areas. This was accomplished 28 years ago and I have never regretted the decision.<br><br>A frequent topic of conversation with young and elder alike centers on where survival priorities lay in context to such seemingly simple losses as electric power. The reality of such has hit home to many across the continent in events such as Katrina.<br><br>I recently read two articles which remind of the generations X &amp; Y who are coming to productive age with the burden of expectation by association.....from industrialism carried on their shoulders. I do not envy the reality shocks I am seeing in many.<br><br>In the same frame it is refreshing to see a large contingency from both generations actively involved in the ideaologies those of my generation professed as "future".

Cannot think of anything worthwhile to add!<br><br>The part where ibn Khaldûn points out that “the desert nomads who conquered the urban centers never quite grasped the necessity of the irrigation systems, and starved them of resources until they slid down the slow curve of failure” is haunting.<br><br>You see, the “nomads” don’t have to come from outside, a civilization can generate them internally.<br><br>For example, I remember reading where studies of long established European regions indicated that the ordinary citizens tended to care for their land and culture. I guess that comes from still walking up the road every month to put flowers of great grandmum’s grave and expecting that your great grandchildren will be living not far from where you are living now, and will similarly tend your grave.<br><br>Kind of gives you the long perspective.<br><br>The wealthy, however, were the greatest threat to the region’s welfare as they tended to want to “strip mine” it in one fashion and another, then move on. That “strip mining then moving on” has been a problem anywhere where there are large, open civilizations with places to “move on” to and where some individuals have been allowed to accumulate great wealth.<br><br>From the point of view of the economists “rational agent” it is the most sensible thing to do, at least in the extraordinarily narrow and strange meaning that economists place on such things. Notice, however, that those same economists are very, very careful not to tell us what they really mean when they force their ratbag theories of self regularizing markets, low tax for the wealthy, and other rubbish down our collective throats.<br><br>It’s bad enough having barbarians WITHIN the gates without having an entire class that claims the right to run our economy who are their toadies.<br><br>I long ago reached the conclusion that any truly sustainable civilization would have to severely limit the accumulation of great wealth as an end in itself, as many have in the past.<br><br><a href=#c1618109945531982506 title="comment permalink">2/19/09, 5:50 PM</a><br><br>

If an ancient civilization was so easily undone by the loss of a vital, transparent technology, how much more so will this be in our world, with several inter-twined "invisible technologies".

Still, remember the principle of dissensus -- there is no one "most important technology;" the one that's most important is the one that fails and leaves you twisting in the wind. <br><br>Mark, it's a very recent thing in most areas -- traditional agriculture tends toward a polyculture that mixes annuals, perennials, animals, etc. <br><br>Anthony, thank you. <br><br>Otse, excellent. It's an ill wind that blows no minds. <br><br>Evan, the unraveling of the internet is much on my mind these days, too -- among other things. <br><br>Stephen, you might enjoy Toynbee's discussion of the schism in a declining society between an increasingly parasitic dominant minority and an increasingly alienated internal proletariat.

A lot of boomers look for an early retirements with a large egg nest. Many were hoping to unload their 600K$ McMansions on younger folks. I am an X-gen, and I remember very well the fella in an economy class who warned us not to expect a fraction of what our parents had in term of material comfort. I guess many X-gen bought into the unlimited growth culture, but many kept their eyes opened and cultivated an healty suspicion of the dominant culture. The boomers who did not buy into the frenzy of consumerism of the Reagan years were the very few who really digged into the 60-70s counterculture. It was a tiny fraction with no enough demographic power and political clout to change the course of history. In retrospect, the Boomers will be seen as the generation which lost the oppportunity to steer the Titanic away from the iceberg. <br><br>IMO, the new generation of doomers have very little new to say that was not implied in the works of Odum, Hardin, Ehrlich the Club of Rome etc...What I really appreciate with JMG is the credit he give to old timers, history and his level-headed attitude. <br><br>For short-term forecasting, I like George Soros and Micheal Hudson.

It could serve a useful purpose at a time when the parabolic rise in oil prices reinforces the prospects of a recession but it would not address the fundamental problems of peak oil, global warming, and dependence on politically unstable or hostile countries for our energy supplies. Those problems can be solved only by developing carbon-free sources of energy. The imminent onset of a recession, by reducing the demand for oil in the developed countries, is likely to bring some relief from higher oil prices, but that relief will be temporary. It should not divert our attention from the pressing need for developing alternative energy sources, and that will entail higher prices, at least in the early stages."<br><br>The reality shock come not from the fact that people could not see what is coming, they did not want to see it.

I know that, as JMG mentions, we can't engineer and plan everything, we've got to allow for spontaneous evolution and emergence. But does it have to be so black and white? Can't we have some humility and work in some room for spontaneity, while also engineering some things? The first step would be to come to consensus on what are our basic needs and then figure out what technologies could produce those, as optimally (taking account of all the known tradeoffs--least labor vs most comfort, less upfront labor vs less ongoing labor, automation vs durability, good for humans in the short run vs good for the ecosystem in the long run, individual freedom vs social stability, ecological diversity vs ease of harvest, least labor vs yield, etc) and ecologically as possible. Nature will do the optimization using its memetic and genetic algorithms, but it will take much time and much suffering. Maybe we could help that process with our ability to plan and figure things out more quickly. There are so many systemic problems to figure out--how to have technologies which are able to form a stable web--one's input being provided by another's output, as well as micro details (how to make fiber, rubber, matches, or substitutes), how to actually implement such a plan (calling all blacksmiths, coopers, glass-makers, inventors, potters, etc), how to design in some spontaneity. <br><br>I know this is supposedly part of permaculture, but most permaculturists are too content to keep their dependence on the current system, through solar panels, through rubber hoses, through propane, matches, the need for money to keep buying things from the system, etc. I mean they don't go far enough. <br><br>Does anyone know how to convene such a forum of designers, engineers and craftspeople?<br>-IC<br><br><a href=#c2710284728262881173 title="comment permalink">2/23/09, 5:26 AM</a><br><br>

Plastics are used in so many ways that it is utterly impossible to be in a ordinary living room of a European or American and to look in a direction where there isn't a plastic. I even suggested long ago in some talks that, if we have to use oil for something, let it be for plastics ( even if only as thermal insulants ). Radio is a backbone of communications that is very reliable and energetically cost effective and it is possibly the last reason that people will have to generate electricity after all the lamps, computers, washing machines, freezers, etc... go to the way of the junkyard. People in this age simply do not understand how a cheap and reliable communication medium is valuable, atleast until a earthquake or other natural disaster cuts it....<br><br>I have to somewhat disagree with you in a point though: most likely the end of the North African bread basket has much more to do with the destruction by lack of maintenance of the terrace-based agriculture ( a very useful technique still used today in the Mediterranean Europe ( like in Portugal where I live... just search "Alto douro" in the web ), that prevents erosion at the same time that helps retaining water, a ever-present worry in dry subtropical agriculture ). This seems to had been a centuries wide process that started still in the late Roman years and that ended near the Arab conquest. It had most likely nothing to do with climate changes there ( but it is a good example of lack of maintenance of small things can lead to major disasters ).<br><br>To end, there is a indispensible technology that is all but gone: wood craftmanship, especially of big trees wood. Working wood in various shapes is very dificult and it will be a sorely needed knowledge when melting metal becomes too much expensive to make all metal machines. My biggest worry about that is the transoceanic sail ships, that need trees that don't exist ( in the same way that it is impossible to make repairs to the Qheops cedar barge found near the Pyramid named after him: there are no Cedars big enough to make the pieces of the size the original had )and craftsmen that will probably have to relearn all of the art by themselfes. That alone may be enough to cut the new world from the old for some centuries, until the trees grow. In fact I read recently a study that strongly suggests that the European age of Sail was only possible to the XIV century depopulation of Europe, that allowed the growth of very large oaks and that the naval supremacy of the various european countries had much to do with the level of care they had with their large oaks ( that were fundamental to make the keels of large wooden ships in Europe ). The ones that overused their oaks, like Portugal, started to make less strong ships that more times sanked that finished trips ( if you understand Portuguese, you can read <i>História Trágico-Maritima</i> to see that the ships were clearly badly built, overused and with bad capitains ), while England had the good sense of using their oaks in a much more phased plan and took care of not making bad ships. I fear that the lack of good wood craftmen and of good woods in acessible spots will make things much harder that they could be, because when metal parts become expensive, all the plows, ships and machinery in general are made of wood with metal in small quantities where it is really needed.<br><br>Of course this are the words of the current holder of a atleast century wide wood craftsmen family in a country where the mechanical beasts were rare until maybe 40 years ago......<br><br><a href=#c8374100867569976927 title="comment permalink">2/23/09, 1:04 PM</a><br><br>

Bad URL so..<br><br>Thomas Sugrue, native Detroiter, historian and author of "The<br>Origins of the Urban Crisis," has spent 20 years in major<br>cities in the United Sates and in London. He came to the Free<br>Press in the summer of 1998 to talk about the conditions that<br>created present-day Detroit, and the implications for<br>journalists. These are excerpts from his talk.<br><br>Anyone who has spent time in cities like Detroit in America's<br>former industrial heartland can't help but be struck by the<br>eerily apocalyptic landscapes that are so common as one passes<br>through these places.<br><br>I asked a simple, but very difficult question: "Why?"<br><br>After digging around in the papers of unions and business,<br>civil rights organizations, census data, city records and<br>countless newspaper articles, I arrived at the conclusion that<br>follows: Detroit's woes began, not in the 1960s with the riot,<br>not with the election of Coleman Young as mayor, not with the<br>rise of international competition and the auto industry's<br>globalization, they began amid the steaming prosperity and<br>consensus of the 1950s, and in an era about which we have very<br>little to go on apart from hoary shibboleths and cliches.<br><br>A THREE-PART STORY<br><br>Three sweeping changes transformed the city. These three<br>things, occurring simultaneously and interacting, dramatically<br>reshaped the metropolis of Detroit and other metropolises like<br>it. First was deindustrialization, the flight of jobs away<br>from the city, something that began unnoticed and unheralded<br>in the 1950s.<br><br>Next was persistent racial discrimination in labor markets.<br>Racial discrimination remained a very persistent problem<br>despite decades of civil rights activism and some improvement<br>in attitudes and beliefs.<br><br>Finally was intense residential segregation, a division of the<br>metropolitan area into two metropolitan areas: one black and<br>one white.<br><br>Any one of these forces would have been devastating, but the<br>fact that all three of them occurred simultaneously and<br>interacted with each other proved to have devastating<br>consequences.<br><br>WORKPLACE DISCRIMINATION<br><br>World War II was a great moment of opportunity for<br>working-class Detroiters, black and white alike. The city was<br>a magnet for workers coming from other parts of the country.<br>African-Americans had been pretty much closed out of the<br>industries that provided skilled jobs, but that pretty much<br>ended during World War II.<br><br>Only 3 percent of auto workers in Detroit were black in 1940.<br>By 1945, 15 percent of the city's auto workers were African<br>American. Detroit, then, became a magnet for black migrants<br>who heard about these great opportunities. But the reality for<br>black workers, even in this window of opportunities, was a<br>great deal more complicated and harsher and more frustrating<br>than those statistics would lead us to believe.<br><br>DEINDUSTRIALIZATION<br><br>One of the supreme ironies of post-war Detroit is that, just<br>as discrimination was under siege, just as blacks found a<br>small window of opportunity in the city's labor market, that<br>job base began to fall away.<br><br>First, beginning in the late '40, and especially in the 1950s,<br>began a process that has continued right up to the present.<br>Jobs began to move out of places like Detroit to low-wage<br>regions in other parts of the United States and the world.<br>Companies in Detroit began picking up and moving their<br>production to rural Indiana and Ohio, increasingly to the<br>South and, by the 1970s and beyond, increasingly to the Third<br>World -- places where wages and other standards were lower<br>than they were in Detroit.<br><br>At the same time, industry in Detroit was changing from<br>within. There was introduction of automation, of new,<br>labor-saving technology within the factories. The consequence<br>was a dramatic decline in the number of manufacturing jobs,<br>solid, blue-collar jobs, the jobs that made Detroit the city<br>that it was.<br><br>Between 1947 and 1963, a period of unprecedented national<br>economic prosperity, Detroit lost 134,000 manufacturing jobs.<br>This is not the '70s. This is not when there is any<br>competition from Germany and Japan and Korea for automobiles.<br>These are jobs that were picking up and moving to other parts<br>of the country, or these were jobs that were being replaced by<br>machines.<br><br>Workers who had come to Detroit during World War II, seeking<br>opportunities, found their choices seriously constrained. The<br>workers who suffered the worst were African Americans, and<br>they suffered because of seniority. African Americans, because<br>they didn't get their foot into the door until the 1940s, were<br>the first to be fired. So, when companies began moving out of<br>Detroit, the burden was borne disproportionately by black<br>Detroiters.<br><br>So, in the midst of the 1950s, 15.9 percent of blacks were<br>unemployed, but only 6 percent of whites were unemployed, so<br>we're talking about black unemployment two and a half times<br>the rate of white unemployment.<br><br>RESIDENTIAL DISCRIMINATION<br><br>The third and, indeed, probably the most pernicious force was<br>residential discrimination by race. The city was divided into<br>districts by race, divided by invisible lines.<br><br>These invisible lines were drawn in a whole bunch of different<br>ways by different groups. The federal government subsidized<br>housing development for whites through the Federal Housing<br>Administration and Home Owners Loan Corporation. But federal<br>policies prohibited making loans to risky properties, and<br>risky properties, according to federal standards, meant homes<br>in old or homes in racially or ethnically heterogeneous<br>neighborhoods. It meant that, if you were a black trying to<br>build your own home or trying to get a loan to purchase a<br>home, you had many obstacles to face, whereas if you were a<br>white it was really quite easy.<br><br>Real estate investors reinforced these invisible racial lines<br>by steering black home buyers to certain neighborhoods and<br>white home buyers to certain other neighborhoods, and stirring<br>up racial anxiety when neighborhoods were along that invisible<br>boundary.<br><br>In one west-side neighborhood, in the late 1950s, there were<br>more than 50 real estate agents working a several-block area<br>trying to persuade panicked whites to sell now and sell fast<br>because "they're moving in." Real estate agents even went so<br>far as to pay African-American women to walk their children<br>through all-white streets to encourage panic among white home<br>owners.<br><br>Also reinforcing these invisible boundaries were the actions<br>of ordinary people. There were more than 200 violent racial<br>incidents that accompanied the first blacks who moved into<br>formerly white neighborhoods in Detroit.<br><br>If you were the first black to move into a formerly all-white<br>block, you could expect, certainly, for your house to be<br>pelted with rocks and stones. In one case, a tree stump went<br>through a window.<br><br>Regularly, vandals would break 20, 30 -- every window in a<br>house. Arson was another popular tactic.<br><br>As newspaper reporters, if such an incident were happening<br>today, you can be sure that you would be covering it, but<br>until 1956, there was not a mention of any of these incidents<br>in Detroit's daily newspapers. They were off the radar of the<br>major dailies.<br><br>This process of housing discrimination set into motion a chain<br>reaction.<br><br>Blacks were poorer than whites and they had to pay more for<br>housing. They had a harder time getting loans. Hence, they<br>spent more of their income on the purchase of real estate.<br>They were, by and large, confined to the oldest houses in the<br>city, houses that needed lots of repair work. Many of their<br>houses deteriorated as a consequence of them being older, not<br>being able to get loans and folks not having all that much<br>money in their pockets. City officials looked out onto the<br>poor housing stock in poor neighborhoods and said, "we should<br>tear this down."<br><br>Moreover, the fact that housing stock was old and in many<br>cases deteriorating in black neighborhoods provided seemingly<br>irrefutable evidence to whites that blacks were irresponsible.<br>"We kept up our property, why aren't they keeping up their<br>property?<br><br>Finally, this neighborhood deterioration seemed to lenders<br>definitive proof that blacks were a poor credit risk and<br>justified disinvestment.<br><br>CONCLUSION<br><br>To talk about Detroit's problems beginning in 1967, or<br>beginning with the election of Coleman Young, or beginning<br>with the globalization of the 1970s is to miss the boat.<br><br>The pattern of workplace discrimination, of the massive loss<br>of jobs, of the residential balkanization of the city into<br>black and white -- this was already well established by 1967.<br>It wasn't Coleman Young that led to the harsh racial divisions<br>between blacks and whites in metropolitan Detroit. It was<br>there, and had been festering for a long time.<br><br>It wasn't the riot that led to disinvestment from the city of<br>Detroit. Disinvestment had been going on very significantly<br>for years.<br><br>And it wasn't globalization that led to the loss of jobs. That<br>loss of jobs was going on when the auto industry was at its<br>very peak.<br><br>IMPLICATIONS<br><br>We focus on changing the attitudes and motivations of<br>individual workers, rather than challenging larger<br>discriminatory practices.<br><br>We have a policy mismatch, a gap between the reality that I<br>have described and the policy recommendations to try to<br>address those problems.<br><br>The premise of welfare reform is to put welfare recipients to<br>work. The problem is that the areas with the greatest job<br>growth in the metropolitan area tend to be the farthest away<br>from where the poorest folk live, in the outer suburbs largely<br>inaccessible by public transportation. So there's a gap<br>between the reality of jobs and job loss and a policy<br>solution.<br><br>Another major one,is downtown revitalization and tourism:<br>"Build casinos and they will come. You need to deal with the<br>deeply rooted problems I've described: job flight, racial<br>segregation, discrimination.<br><br>We need to think about providing poor people with access to<br>secure, well-paying jobs, wherever those jobs might be.<br><br><a href=#c7195962021310558489 title="comment permalink">2/24/09, 7:12 AM</a><br><br>

Many of the tools we need for the first phases of the transition, at least, are already in existence or under development. One important task ahead of us is getting these things better known. <br><br>Toomas, libraries are crucial, but I have my doubts about microfilm -- anything that requires plenty of energy and technology to create and read is potentially a blind alley. I'll be talking more about this in a future post. <br><br>Ricardo, if you'll reread my post you'll find that neglect of agricultural infrastructure was discussed there. Climate change, though, is also an issue; as with most things, it's a multifactorial situation. As for woodworking, though, that's a crucial technology -- far more useful than plastics, since the raw material grows itself. <br><br>Yooper, most interesting. <br><br>Fed Up, the technosphere is an outgrowth of the noosphere, not a step toward it. I've never understood why human beings so often insist that they have the only nervous systems on the planet -- or that they so often neglect the role of information flow in other natural systems.

We need to relearn and reinvent hand tools, made mostly from wood, that can be used to make wood products and other products. The information on building and maintaining such tools is dying. I own a two-person timber saw, but can't find information on how to maintain it. I saw a USFS pamphlet on it written in the 70s (as I recall) at the remote place I stayed at in the Hurricane Wilderness in AR, but haven't been able to find it again. An unmaintained timber saw is worse than useless--it consumes a net amount of energy (of the people using it).<br><br>Renewable resources are one important feature of any future technology, but I would add to that:<br>Local Autopoiesis-the ability to create the parts for the system and assemble them locally in a cycle--the tools used for making anything can themselves be built out of the parts that they help produce (nature has already figured this out) and there is little waste. A partial example is bricks: they can be fired in a brick kiln. This is an example which has only one circular connection, but more complex webs of materials and products can exist in a locally autopoietic way. It is the locality and cyclical nature of the system that matter. The present system is neither local nor cyclical:Most stuff we use is made and requires raw materials and parts from many far-off places, and when the product breaks or ages, it is usually not fixed or recycled, it is waste.<br>-IC<br><br><a href=#c1786497625460338412 title="comment permalink">2/25/09, 4:59 AM</a><br><br>

I especially appreciate the deep historical and cultural perspective you bring to your essays, often lacking in our 'immediate rear-view mirror' society.<br><br>Offhand question, I was wondering whether you're familiar with John Gribbin's 'Deep Simplicity' which has many concepts applicable to the current situation - usually not comforting ones.<br><br>Per your first comment, the impending changes will reflect a sort of Liebig's law of the minimum, where the ability of reality to meet expectations will be hampered by the resource that falls short first.<br><br>This can be dangerous in more than one sense - not only directly from the gap between necessity (perceived or actual) and physical possibility (or impossibility) but also because the emergence of a given 'minimum' may serve to mask or distract from other minimums that are coming up around the bend, only to appear just as the first one is remediated. At such a point, Liebig's law may then be converted to Liebig's 'whack-a-mole' corollary in which knocking down one problem only leads to (and may cause or exacerbate) another.<br><br>Finally, one of the critical aspects of unnoticed technology is the need to preserve a nucleus of that knowledge in wide and accessible distribution. You've commented before on getting into ham radio as one means of maintaining communication networks over distances and I'd be interested to hear what other 'descent appropriate' skills you would add to the list (apart from the obvious gardening, animal husbandry, etc).

In the past there was no way to make them stable. But today we have computer power that can be used to make them stable. By using the greater computer power of today we can have a much higher turn over of capital in the capital market. This higher turnover will make the market harder to game or control and the market will no longer have the unstable run ups or declines. Who can change or control the market when say 20% of the capital is trading each day? So now that we have the compute power to provide for all these transactions that will smooth out the market how do we force people to turn over at a rate of 20% a day? Easy, put a cap gains tax of 0% (zero) on all gains of 7 days or less and put a cap gains tax of 90% of all gains of more than 7 days. The likes of Yahoo, Micosoft and/or Sun Micro Systems will give us the systems that will provide automated software agents to support turning over one's investments every 7 days (based on the specs you give the agent). A system like this will make the financial markets work as smoothly as the local fruit market.<br><br><a href=#c596783256409965395 title="comment permalink">3/18/09, 1:39 PM</a><br><br>
