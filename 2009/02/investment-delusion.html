You might think that my position as head of a contemporary<a href=http://www.aoda.org/ > Druid order</a>, with the colorful title and funny hat that go along with it, would keep me safely out of touch with the mainstream of American opinion. Still, it's been my experience that when I talk about peak oil to a pagan audience, I get the same reactions and questions I can expect from the most mainstream listeners.<br><br>I had a reminder of that the weekend before last, when I spoke on the future of industrial society at <a href=http://www.pantheacon.com/ >Pantheacon</a>, one of the largest pagan conventions in America these days. Yes, pagans have conventions; this one happens annually on President's Day weekend at the Doubletree Inn in San Jose, California; it's an endless source of amusement, at least to me, that conference rooms more often used for corporate sales meetings spend one weekend a year hosting something so different.<br><br>Pantheacon is always a learning experience. (Mind you, one lesson I learned this year was that it's wise to avoid the Doubletree's pet steak house, Spencer's, unless you fancy undistinguished food and glacially slow service at a jawdropping price.) Still, I also gained a useful reminder of the way that certain misguided ideas pervade every corner of contemporary society, and it came – as such insights usually do – during the question and answer session that followed my talk on peak oil and the coming deindustrial age.<br><br>The questions that get asked after these presentations are as predictable as a politician's excuses, though not all of them are as pointless. There's always somebody who is sure that I haven't heard of the energy source he's convinced will enable the world to keep on increasing energy use at an exponential rate forever. There's always somebody who's convinced that an evolutionary leap or some other <i>deus ex machina</i> will allow us to dodge the consequences of our own bad choices. There's always somebody who thinks I'm talking about fleeing to a cabin in the hills with plenty of ammo and canned beans. All these get crisp replies detailing the reasons why I think they're deluding themselves. Then there are the people who want to know what they can do to deal with the challenges of the future, and they get the best advice I can give them.<br><br>Finally, though, there's always somebody who wants to know what investment strategies I recommend. These days, the person who asks that question is usually silver-haired, nicely dressed, and visibly worried. I wish I had a crisp reply for that question, or for that matter, some good advice to offer. I don't, because the question itself embodies a series of fatally flawed assumptions that reach right down to the nature of wealth itself. On its own terms, it's as unanswerable as a question about how to build a working perpetual motion machine.<br><br>Yes, someone at my Pantheacon talk asked about investment strategies, and yes, she was silver-haired, nicely dressed, and visibly worried. I fumbled through an answer, but the question deserves more than that, if only because it's on so many minds these days. Thus this week's post. I should caution those of my readers who have investments that they won't like what follows.<br><br>Let's start with fundamentals: the nature of wealth. Ask ten people on the street today for a definition of wealth, and dollars will get you doughnuts every one of them will tell you that wealth consists of the possession of plenty of money. That's what nearly everyone thinks, but they're quite wrong, and it's easy enough to show the fallacy.<br><br>Imagine that a private jet full of politicians makes an emergency landing on an uninhabited island in the Pacific. Each of the politicians is carrying a briefcase containing $1 million – we'll be polite and say it's from campaign contributions. The island has a water supply and enough natural foodstuffs that the politicians don't have to worry about starving to death. Will the politicians on the island have a standard of living corresponding to their net worth of $1 million each? Of course not; their actual prosperity will be measured by the breadfruit they harvest, the fish they catch, the huts they make, and so on. <br><br>Money, in other words, is not wealth. It's a social mechanism for distributing wealth. It means nothing unless there's real wealth – actual, nonfinancial goods and services – to back it up. In a healthy market economy, there's a rough balance between the amount of money in circulation and the amount of real wealth produced annually, and so the confusion between money and wealth can slip by unnoticed. When money and wealth get out of sync with one another, problems sprout.<br><br>The economic history of the 19th century offers a good example. The rising industrial economy of the time drove a massive increase in the production of real wealth. Most industrial nations, though, inherited money systems backed by gold reserves that offered few options for expanding the money supply to match the supply of real wealth. The result was a deflationary spiral that brought major economic depressions every couple of decades for most of the century. In response, in the 20th century, nation after nation abandoned the gold standard's straitjacket and retooled their money systems to meet the needs of an expanding economy.<br><br>That's the context of the present crisis because, in terms of real wealth, we no longer have an expanding economy. The production of real wealth in the world's industrial nations has been in decline now for decades. Some of the deficit has been made up by importing real wealth from overseas, but not all; compare the lifestyle available to a single salary working class American family in 1969 to the lifestyle available to a similar family today and it's possible to get a glimpse of just how much impoverishment has taken place over the last forty years.<br><br>This impoverishment went unnoticed by most people because the money supply didn't follow suit. Until the economy came unglued in the second half of 2008, money had never been so abundant or readily available. Some of it got spent on real wealth, which is why real estate and other commodities soared to giddy heights, but most of it was diverted instead into various forms of abstract pseudo-wealth related to money in much the way that money relates to real wealth. Yes, I'm talking about your investments.<br><br>The confusion between money and wealth and the biases imposed by the long economic expansion of industrialism have made it almost impossible to talk sensibly about investments these days. It seems normal to most people that they should be able to invest their money and, as a matter of course, get back more than they put in. This reflects the dynamics of an expanding economy; if the production of real wealth is increasing, investments on average will increase in value over time to match the growth in real wealth, and the payback on investments reflects this. Outside of the special conditions of a growth economy, though, that logic no longer applies.<br><br>The long economic expansion of the industrial age has fostered the massive growth of what old-fashioned Marxists used to call a rentier class – a class whose money makes money for them. Even among people who work for a living, the idea of joining the rentier class on retirement, and living comfortably off investments, has become very popular in recent years. The problem, of course, is that the age of industrial expansion is over; it was made possible in the first place only by exponentially increasing the use of fossil fuels and other natural resources; like all exponential growth curves, it faced an inevitable collision with the limits of its environment – and that collision is happening around us right now.<br><br>We are thus entering a period of prolonged economic contraction – not a recession, or even a depression, but a change in the fundamental dynamic of the economy. Over the centuries just past, a rising tide of economic growth was interrupted by occasional periods of contraction; over the centuries ahead, the long decline of the industrial economy will doubtless be interrupted by occasional periods of relative prosperity. Just as a rising tide lifts all boats, a falling tide lowers them all, and if the tide goes out far enough, a great many boats will end up high and dry.<br><br>The desperate attempt by full-time and part-time members of the rentier class to avoid dealing with this unwelcome reality has had the ironic result of making the situation much worse than it had to be. As actual investments in productive economic activities stopped yielding a noticeable profit, more and more investors sought to make money via a menagerie of exotic financial livestock notable for their complete disconnection from the economy of goods and services. The result was a series of classic speculative bubbles, culminating in the crash of 2008 and the crisis still unfolding around us. In the process, eager investors who might have lost their money slowly over a period of years have, instead, lost it all at once.<br><br>Still, in a contracting economy, on average, all investments lose money. This is the hard reality with which all of us will have to deal. This is why, in the twilight years of the Roman world, a complex money economy that made heavy use of credit and investment gave way to purely local economies of barter and customary exchange, in which money played a very minor role and credit was unheard of. It is also why the two great religious movements that rose out of Rome's ruins, Christianity and Islam, both considered lending at interest a mortal sin – though Christianity managed to talk itself out of that useful teaching some centuries ago.<br><br>Thus the only investment advice I can offer is to get out of investments altogether, and put your money into something that will actually be useful: training in practical skills that will make you employable in a deindustrializing economy, for example, or extra insulation so you can keep your home livable with less energy. At this point in history, the belief that it's possible to have your money make your living for you is basically a delusion; it's likely to be a fairly persistent one, but those who can shake themselves free of it and adjust to life in a radically different economic reality are likely to do better than those who keep on chasing the prospects of an age that is ending around us.

For an equity to simply retain its value, earnings must grow over time. In an economy making a tranisition to a no-growth state, surplusses (if any) contract in size, proportional to the amount of excess energy available to produce those surplusses. Currently, the amount of available excess energy appears to be decreasing. In this situation, it wouldn't really make sense to hold any kind of stock at all. The same goes for corporate bonds, where the ability to pay the interest on the bonds depends on corporate earnings, although for government debt, the payments of principal and interest depend on the size of the tax base and how much taxation they will bear before a revolt of one kind or another occurs. As far as I can predict, the only investments which will make money would be part ownership in reserves of scarce resources such as oil and natural gas. minerals (phosphates), arable farmland (which has a steady water supply from rainfall or natural watercourses), all of which would produce something that could be used in place of paper money (or upon the value of which notes or other marketable ownership interests could be based).<br><br>As for wealth and money, you're wealthy if you have a surplus of food, tangible goods which you produce, tangible goods upon which your life (and comfort) depends, paper money or its equivalent, or some combination of these items, at the end of each month. If you have a deficit, you're poor. I've known people who cannot make ends meet at an income of $80,000 per month - they spend $100,000 per month, thus go into debt (or spend their capital) at the rate of $20,000 per month. Eventually they'll have spent all their capital and they will end up impoverished and unable to fend for themselves. I've also know people who can put aside $1000 per month - and they end up rich.<br><br>Really, in a low or no-growth economy, the only "investments" are things that are stores of value, such as land, water, non-perishable food, tangible goods (hand sewing needles, salt, coffee, pepper, cinnamon, tea...), and perhaps precious metals like gold, silver, copper, tin, lead, and aluminum.<br><br><a href=investment-delusion.html#c4400249292798150392 title="comment permalink">2/26/09, 1:26 AM</a><br><br>

Money PANIC!<br><br>Banks stopped lending then to pay off huge international debts because we spent too much to purchase Louisiana and people all over the place were dunning us for the money. Sound familiar?<br><br>A few years later ,1837, banks stopped lending again. Different reasons, sort of, same result. PANIC!<br><br>The we got serial PANICS! starting in 1857 when the railroad bubble burst. The folks playing with soapsuds in those dear bygone days, too? And the results, well you know---pop. The railroads did it again in 1873 and again for the grand finale in 1893. Never could make the iron horse pay its way. Still can't.

They will of course miss your point that real wealth would be the knowledge of how to create these things from the real resources on hand, not just how to hoard them and keep marauders at bay. <br><br>I'd propose that a major component of real wealth is social connections. I don't mean what we now pass off as "networking," which is a stockpiling of contacts for job hunting. It's the basic feature of simply knowing, and learning to get along with, your neighbors and townspeople even though you all disagree on many things. I also don't mean planned and intentional communities of all sorts, including "transition towns" and the like, that use as a premise the assumption that we need to have everyone be of like mind and on the same page even if that means we have to displace the people who are already there. It's just a simple working together, so you individually don't have to be able to do everything on your own -- you can raise chickens and more eggs than you know what to do with, your neighbor has a magic touch in the garden, her uncle always brings in the best corn crop, and his sister-in-law can keep any roof from leaking, that sort of thing. This is the polar opposite of the urban refugee in the wilderness compound behind concrete walls, and it quite possibly doesn't even require moving very far (or at all) from where you are living right now.<br><br><a href=investment-delusion.html#c3779667438120937435 title="comment permalink">2/26/09, 5:27 AM</a><br><br>

People need to invest in relationships as well as their own skill set and abilities. Land is of course good. If I had a million to burn, I'd buy some land, and set up a little learning center, teaching the trades and skills that don't seem to be covered very well today, not only by universities but even community colleges. Sort of an apprentice center for the trades of tomorrow. And with places to stay for homeless youth who would commit fully to that program, and promise to teach the next generation themselves as a point of honor. Bill Gates? Are you listening?

Skills are a better investment. <br><br>Lloyd, all too true. <br><br>M. Craft, you're welcome. <br><br>Robert, to my mind what you're describing is an effect of an inherently inflexible money system, not a cause. The gold standard has its own serious problems; it's not a panacea. <br><br>RDatta, as I mentioned, a lot of my readers will be unhappy with this post. Still, they're going to be no happier if they ignore it and watch their investments move toward their logical final value of zero. <br><br>Bill, exactly. The basic unit of human survival is the community, not the individual -- and I should probably add, it's most likely to be the community where you live right now. <br><br>Lance, you'd burn a million pretty quickly with that plan! Still, might do some good. <br><br>Yooper, all I can say is "this ain't no sitcom..." <br><br>Raymond, it's some of each. Some people -- especially the Ray Kurzweil fans -- do seem to believe literally that humanity will just keep on increasing its energy use exponentially forever; have you seen the proposed classification of civilizations according to whether they dispose of the total energy flows of (a) a planet, (b) a solar system, or (c) a galaxy? Still, there are many more whose daydreams of the future imply this without affirming it in so many words. <br><br>Matt, this takes some work, since it's necessary to filter out the effects of the inflated money supply. One useful measure is to look at the number of jobs in mining, farming, and manufacturing lost in the US and other industrial nations since, say, 1970. Another is to track nonfinancial balance of trade figures; when median real income in a society is flat or declining, exports of real wealth dry up, and imports of real wealth climb, it's a fair guess that production of real wealth is dropping. <br><br>Ruben, my set of standard replies to the standard questions probably requires a post of its own -- which I'll certainly consider doing.<br><br><a href=investment-delusion.html#c2698336092923291558 title="comment permalink">2/26/09, 8:31 AM</a><br><br>

Wasn’t that Confucius’ curse? I started stumbled upon Peak Oil Theory while reading an article by Gwynne Dyer about 3 years ago. In it, he talked about James Howard Kunstler. This led me to his book, The Long Emergency and that book led me to others such as The Oil Depletion Protocol by Heinberg, and articles all over the web. However, of all the articles I have read (sorry, I haven’t got to your book yet but I do plan on it) the one that seems to be the most prescient is Dmtry Orlov’s “Closing the Gap”. I imagine that you have read it, but if you haven’t, he talks about the striking similarities between the collapse of the former USSR and the present collapse of the US. Since he is Russian by birth, but grew up on the US, he offers a unique and legitimate perspective. He is a clever, convincing writer with a good sense of humour. He comes across as honest, and at his base, hopeful.<br><br>I am a schoolteacher on the west coast of Canada. I find myself looking around at my students wondering what kind of world they are going to find themselves in when they reach my age (just shy of 40). I have a couple of young kids myself and I want the best for them as they grow up (like every other parent out there). However, I am pretty sure that is going to entail fostering an appreciation of the simple good things: looking for mushrooms in the forests nearby, baking, cooking, growing vegetables in the garden, etc. vs. jetting off to holiday destinations or buying expensive and fragile/transient toys. We have a strong community in my neighbourhood where we are good friends with the neighbours all around us. This comforts me. I just hope that Dmtry’s view of collapse is a little more accurate than the vision that J. H. Kunstler offers. Already, though, there have been a rash of shooting recently in my city. Almost all of it gang related, but I can’t help but sense and level of anxiousness/unease in the air.<br><br>Cheers,<br>BB<br><br><a href=investment-delusion.html#c993087869339691685 title="comment permalink">2/26/09, 8:31 AM</a><br><br>

People should know how to make, fix, and use tools to produce useful items, food, shelter, clothing, and so on.

I agree with Robert that the gold standard was not the source of the various depressions of the 19th and 20th centuries. Robert also used the old term which needs to come back into vogue of "PANIC" to describe the events. I also have studied these various panics and most share common characteristics of cheap credit, debt, over investment and greed and then collapse. Sound familiar? This panic is different for many reasons and you hit most of them but it's possible this panic could become the mother of all financial panics chiefly because of the global scale of the interconnected webs of leveraged bets, unbacked CDS and forex swaps and derivatives and money inventing all manner of absurd "investment vehicles!" like CDO's and the like: cash into trash that is now going up in smoke, all the result of cheap credit and an astounding deleveraged debt implosion. The actors in the beltway have changed but the play is much the same with massive continued and accelerating debt assumption by the government to try to get us all back in the station wagon again on our trip to the American dream. Their assumptions are of course wrong but they don't see it. Both Einstein and Will Rogers both said something to the effect of "if stupidity got us into this mess, then why can't it get us out?". The only way you can justify going into debt is that if you have growth going forward to pay back the principal and the interest of that debt. You pointed out that industrial contraction will not allow this debt to be serviced without growth in goods and services, so what alternative is there? Default.Bankruptcy. Lots of nations have defaulted on their debt over the past millennia. A good paper by Ken Rogoff for the IMF looked at 800 years of defaults. Default will almost certainly be part of the picture here. I better close. I do have a good link for family income in the US in the postwar period to the present. You have to search a bit for the relevant graphs but they amply support your contention of wealth declining here, primarily in the past 30 years or so.To wit using ? inflation figures median family income in 1979 was about $38K and by 2006 had risen to a lofty $42K. Final comment is as you say, we will need to make things again of real value. In 1960 our manufacturing sector was 26% of the workforce and it has declined to a paltry 9+% mostly making weapons, airplanes and heavy equipment. My sources are the OECD fact book, the IMF, the CIA factbook and here is that final link for Matt:http://mwhodges.home.att.net/family.htm<br>Cheers and thanks again for a tidy summary of our current financial arrmageddon.<br><br><a href=investment-delusion.html#c6574086511113473919 title="comment permalink">2/26/09, 12:42 PM</a><br><br>

One result of the end of the age of cheap energy will be the unflattening of the world -- sorry, Thomas Friedman -- and what will work in one region may fail utterly in another.

If you can stand losing nearly all of the paper value, buying a home can still make sense, since it's easier to put in a garden, install solar water heating and a composting toilet, etc. when you don't have to please the landlord; as an investment, though, land is pretty much guaranteed to lose you your money. <br><br>Twilight, thank you.

Thank you for what sounds like the most<br>sensible "investment advice" I've read so far. I also enjoyed your<br>description of the Pantheacon. Your sense of humor reminds me of that of the Shinto priests I know (I'm one too), and there is probably a lot in common between the two religions.<br>Recently I was invited to speak before a womens retreat, and talked<br>about reconciliation between spiritualists and non-believers, because we will need to foster communities of people with diverse world views. I noticed that everyone at the retreat was talking in one way or another about<br>community-building. I think most people in Japan (I don't know about other countries) recognize the community as our most crucially important asset in<br>coming times. Also, while land can be confiscated, it's still worthwhile to try as it has intrinsic value enough to be considered a valuable investment,<br>and prices will drop as people become more desperate for cash.<br>I recently cashed in my annuity--penalties be damned--because I do not expect that company or my money to exist in ten years. My husband is learning how to make houses more energy efficient cheaply using readily available materials. I'm learning about healthy methods of food<br>preservation, such as pickling. We rent and farm three fields. So many fields lie fallow that the owners are grateful for someone to work them, improving the soil and keeping up their value as productive land. I recommend anyone with the leeway to make a shift to this kind of lifestyle<br>do it while it is still easy and you have time to learn the skills. Japan has no shortage of octagenarians and nonagenarians to give helpful advice. They would need to be sought out in America.<br><br><a href=investment-delusion.html#c6125588156360256167 title="comment permalink">2/27/09, 5:08 AM</a><br><br>

Training and insulation are top-notch investments. A thousand dollars wisely spent on such investments can save/earn itself over and over again. <br><br>The real point is probably something like relocalization, or maybe reconcretization. Wall Street is remote and abstract. Modern bureaucracy is a wonderful means to obscure and evade responsibility - we've put our trust in a system that slices and repackages and boils it to the point that nothing is left but if we look for who is was that abused the trust, all we find are shadows.<br><br>Investing in yourself, your skills and your insulation, is always smart, and it doesn't require a whole lot of trust. But the best response to the present crisis is not to avoid trusting anyone. One by one, humans are a sorry sort of naked ape. <br><br>Here's one suggestion for the older folks among us and thinking about more attractive possibilities for the golden years. Just as learning practical skills is a splendid investment for younger folks, teaching practical skills is another very worthwhile investment. As one's own physical capabilities decline, the younger folks can thereby pick up the tools and use them well and carry on the work needed for the community to thrive.<br><br><a href=investment-delusion.html#c3751748183633203620 title="comment permalink">2/27/09, 6:29 AM</a><br><br>

As far as I'm aware, no christian church ever said otherwise... what most of them do is to "creativelly" redefine what they do as something necessary for the bigger good or say that money is a object, so it should be bought too or another convuled argument ( just for the record, the first christian theologist that did not condemn inequivocally usury was Calvin, to please the bankers of Geneve.... ). In the other hans and for their own good, the majority of the Muslim world still respects their holy laws ....<br><br>On the topic: I agree that in the following years, making "investements" in the way most people love to talk will give a a verage net loss in real average wealth. But I'm afraid that we'll follow the exact same path that the late roman empire did: people will still invest in commodities, because they will be lured by the rising prices, not noticing that the high prices are created by general scarcity, meaning that their "profits" will be unable to buy anything. At the same time I can definitely see the governements trying to pin people to jobs they consider essential, a form of civilian conscript ( Rome even made some professions forcefully hereditary, like tax collectors and ship crews ) or, using the french word, <i>corvee</i> . And when money is worthless and people are pinned to the ground by force, we are a minimal step away of a feudal like society. I think , to my sadness that in that regard Rome was a little better than us: Rome money was in solid metal and it contained some highly desired metals. So, if no one still believed in the Roman empire, the Roman money would still be useful in terms of trade as a gold or silver dish-like sculpture ( or, using a French Historian words :"When ( in the High Middle Ages ) it was exchanged gold coin, in fact what was exchanged was a group of very precious objects and not coin as we think on it today". Nowadays, pocket money is still somewhat worthy in terms of scrap metal, paper money is worth their weight in paper, electronic money is worth their value in bit weight ( sic ) and promisses to pay are worth the ability and will of the other part to pay... this is , our current money is basically worthless by it self ( and as a humorous side note, the ones with pocket money are in better shape than Soros and Co ;) )<br><br>I definitely agree with your point that the best investement in a society like the one that is coming is in pratical skills: hoarding stuff makes your belongings valuable, hoarding skills make YOU valuable. But if someone wants to spend money in material items, I suggest 3 items ( besides the already mentioned phosphates ):<br>-Seeds<br>Seeds are probably the best investement you can make in material items if they are fertile ( no monsanto sterile seeds ). They are easy to conceal and they yeild a high revenue in other seeds, the only pyramid scheme that works .... In my opinion, the best ones to keep are seeds of the Fabaceae family ( peas, beans, soy.... ): highly nutritive, high dormancy tolerance and they help the soil fertility. A bag of seeds concealed in a coat pocket may be the best thing you can have in troubled days.<br>-Nitrates: The nitrates natural reserves peaked more than a century ago... we didn't noticed that so far because of the Bosch-Haber process, but I don't expect that this high-energy process will be attainable or cost-effective in harsher days. Nitrates are extremely valuable for agriculture, but I definitely do not recommend to keep them in bulk: besides being extremely dificult to maintain out of air-tight enviroments ( They are extremely nydrofiles and water solutions of nitrates are highly corrosive ), nitrates are also needed to make explosives ( including the good old gunpowder ) and having a nice storage of them would make you a really nice target for jackboot theft. If you only want nitrates for your field, the best thing to do is to rotate fabaceae and other cultures in the fields ( or to grow them together ). If that is not enough, the best way is to use the old tried and tested method of pouring some acid ( vinegar works well )in the residue of dried urine ( any mammal urine works well, but the more popular way in the old days was to use horse or donkey urine ) or bird feces . Equines are probably the best suited animals for that, but they are highly valuable for their cargo ability as well....and too bulky to conceal easily. The best thing to do with equines is to maintain them in half-wild state: that would allow, not only cheaper maintenance, but also a chance of the animals not being associated to you.<br>-A good set of portable cast iron kitchen ware: as any person that really cooks ( this excludes microwaves ) knows, the half-life of steel and aluminum kitchen ware is quite small ( somewhere between 5-10 years if you're lucky and maintain it well ). Cast iron kitchen ware if properly maintained ( and the best way of maintaining it is using it ) can last for a century ( I have one pan that belonged to my great grandmother of my father side that it is still usable.... ), not mentioning that the better thermal properties of cast iron cookware make the food more tasty and allows the cooking of meats that would require a pressure cook otherwise ( goat ( a good choice of animal to pasture in dificult years, because they can digest pratically everything that they can chew ), donkey or old horse ( believe me: it is very tasty... in fact, old goat cooked in a cast iron pot in wood fire is a traditional dish in some areas in my country, called <i>chanfana</i> ; it is also a very economical dish, given that old goat meat is pretty cheap in here because it is very dificult to cook besides using this method )).<br>Again, anything made of metal is in danger of being a trouble magnet, but used cast iron cookware has very bad look ( it is coated by black iron oxide... a good rule about cast iron cookware is that blacker is better , but it definitelly looks like carbon coated overburned cookware ... no "shiny" factor ) and will probably be spared in case of facing armed thugs.<br><br>All this items are relatively easy to hide or look undesirable, in spite of being extremely useful. A good bet for troubled days.<br><br><a href=investment-delusion.html#c5413079458208707572 title="comment permalink">2/27/09, 6:55 AM</a><br><br>

Is usury still considered a mortal sin, as it was in the Middle Ages? </i><br><br>Theoretically, yes. As a practical matter, very few even know what usury is. They think means exploitative lending, and that it has something to do with the rate of interest charged, or the financial circumstance of the borrower. While exploitative lending is a sin (and widely recognised as such), it's not usury. It's fraud. I seriously doubt that even 1% of the Catholics engaged in usury could define it, and certainly nobody is going to call them on it, or enlighten them on it. <br><br>There is a fair hope that when the dollar collapses sometime in the next couple of years, moneylending will lose it's aura of respectability and people will once again start thinking of bankers as the parasites they are.<br><br>On a related note, for the goldbugs above, it's not a tenable assertion that a metal-packed currency will prevent depressions and panics. Look up the "Long Depression" of 1873-1886 for an example. It's fractional reserve banking that is the engine of the business cycle, and the author of both bubbles and depressions, not the basis of the currency. So long as some people are allowed to create money out of thin air (which is what banks do when they loan money that is deposited in demand accounts), there will be both booms and recessions. Any time the creation of money is accelerated to create a bubble, as it has been for the last 15 years, there will be a depression. It's theoretically possible for a central banking system like the Fed to dampen the business cycle. I don't think it's politically possible, however, for that to happen for very long in a mass democracy. There's just too much pressure to accelerate money creation in both good times and bad. We saw it in the 1920's and in the last 2 decades.<br><br><a href=investment-delusion.html#c6817547584751175412 title="comment permalink">2/27/09, 10:04 AM</a><br><br>

Perhaps as a store of wealth it might be conceivable to do so, but the value of horses, especially in a post-industrial economy, is their ability to provide draft (draught) power for cartage and farming. <br><br>A good draft horse is at once the most powerful and the most efficient draft animal, both because of her structure, and because of 5000 years of continually evolving technology. When there is no diesel fuel, a four-in-hand can pull 30 tonnes better than an engine. At least on the flat, a hill might require a six-up hitch.<br><br>The most important quality of a good draft horse is tractability. She must be docile, willing, calm and well-disposed towards humans. A horse kept out of human contact will lose those traits very quickly, and revert to the high-strung fearful animal that can survive in the wild. Far better to be actually using that horse on a daily basis.<br><br>Yes horses can be stolen. But at least in this country, such an act was traditionally dealt with by summary execution. Wealth one cannot use for fear of theft is as much good as money one cannot withdraw from a retirement account. Very little in the current situation.<br><br>Two great advantage we will have in the coming centuries are a vast network of paved roads stretching to insanely distant places, and the contributions of folks like Pirelli and Lyons to the art of training horses. Jim Lyons' book <i>Lyons on Horses</i> is the very best book for anybody starting to work with them.<br><br><a href=investment-delusion.html#c2975114120543129903 title="comment permalink">2/27/09, 3:46 PM</a><br><br>

A lot depends on <i>when</i> you get out.<br><br>Having studied trophic systems is some detail, I'm of the opinion that we will see what ecologists call "punctuated equilibrium," except with an overall declining trend.<br><br>Ecologists use variants of what is called the "logistics equation" to model trophic (food energy) systems. A famous example is the relationship of numbers of lynx and hare populations. The lynx eat too many hares, and starvation and disease cause the lynx population to crash, at which point, the hare population skyrockets, enabling the lynx population to also take off. Repeat.<br><br>If, instead of lynx and hare, you plug in human financial wealth as the predator, and crude petroleum as the prey, you get similar behaviour -- around equilibrium, you get chaotic gyrations in both predator and prey. (And, of course, crude petroleum doesn't have offspring, thus the overall declining trend.)<br><br>The point I'm taking way too long to make is that there will be upturns and selling opportunities. On average, each peak will be lower than the previous one, but rather than sell out now, one could wait for $40 oil to cause the economy to take off again, <i>then</i> sell everything in order to get training, buy land, invest in true capital — the means of production.<br><br>The economy <i>will</i> take off again, until it once again hits the "glass ceiling" of trophic limits, at which point, it will crash again. It will probably peak at ~80 million barrels a day or less, rather than the ~87 mb/d we saw last July.<br><br>So there's the market signals. I have no argument against getting out completely — I have — but it would seem prudent to let people know that they don't have to sell in a falling market.<br><br><a href=investment-delusion.html#c7791638166149298371 title="comment permalink">2/27/09, 9:51 PM</a><br><br>

Why should we expect to stop working at about 60-65 years old and continue to be paid money, when we may still have 20-30 more years to live??<br>I imagine that since the dawn of humanity everyone always worked until they could work no longer (even though the nature of "work" meant radically different things in different cultures/times - not necessarily paid employment.) <br>In England here, the first old-age pension from the government was introduced about a century ago, to keep the very aged out of workhouses. I believe less than about 5% of people ever lived long enough to receive it. Since then, the idea that the state should pay you to live comfortably for decades in your later years has taken such a firm grip that people are horrified at the idea of "being forced" to work into your seventies, let alone "working till you drop". I am not suggesting that a 70 year old can do the same type and amount of work as a 20 year old, but equally, why should they expect to do nothing at all but relax, and perhaps babysit the grandchildren now and then?<br><br><a href=investment-delusion.html#c31411773516444724 title="comment permalink">2/28/09, 12:29 PM</a><br><br>

In case anyone has forgotten, before the spectacular financial meltdown, we were already seeing a global economic slowdown caused by "high energy prices," which in fact was really just a sideways euphamistic way of avoiding saying that we had a global economic slowdown because of a global energy shortage. That shortage has gone nowhere. Whether we are technically post peak or not, we are already in the world where the global economy is fundamentally capped by energy resources. As we saw last year, supply no longer increases in response to increased prices caused by higher demand. The price just increases to the point that it triggers enough of an economic decline that demand drops; supply hardly budges. This is a new "fundamental" of the world economy that almost no mainstream economists are taking in to consideration in their analyses and prognostications. <br><br>Sorry to lecture; this is all material that has been covered much better and more thoroughly throuhout this blog, The Oil Drum, and in many other places but it still bears repeating from time to time.<br><br><a href=investment-delusion.html#c6759878391015255335 title="comment permalink">2/28/09, 8:07 PM</a><br><br>

You discuss people who expect to “invest their money and, as a matter of course, get back more than they put in.” <br><br>I’d like to put a slightly different angle on this question. My major resource for aging is a retirement account. Okay, so I’m not going to get back more than I put in...but I still have to figure out the most sensible thing to do now with those funds.<br><br>Even though I don’t have grey hair, I’m almost 67, so this question has great resonance for me personally. I plan to work full time until age 72 and if possible part-time after that. I have a small amount of money in a retirement account (an IRA) but my principal income, after retirement, will be Social Security.<br><br>In earlier civilizations, old people lived with their families, wove at the loom, cared for the grandchildren. This isn’t generally an option in our society. I live on the West Coast; my relatives are on the East Coast. <br><br>You suggest that people should “get out of investments altogether and put your money into something that will actually be useful.” <br><br>There are couple of structural problems in doing this. First, if someone is 59 or younger, and they withdraw money from a retirement account, then they pay a 10% penalty to the IRS. In addition, at any age, you pay full income taxes on anything you withdraw.<br><br>Since I’m working full-time now, I pay a fairly high federal tax (the marginal rate is 15%). I live in Oregon, with a 9% income tax. That means right now I’ll pay approximately 24% income tax on anything I withdraw from the IRA. If I wait five years, I won’t pay any income tax on that withdrawal. That gives me, and people in a similar situation, a substantial incentive to wait!<br><br>If/when I do withdraw the money I’ve saved for retirement, I still face the question of what to do with those funds. You recommend more insulation, and that’s a good idea for anyone who owns their house. However, I wonder about the benefits of “training in practical skills that will make you employable in a deindustrializing economy” for people who are in their 60s. Personally, I already have some of the skills you mention in the Long Descent: I’m an experienced organic gardener and food preserver, and I have some training in both natural and conventional healthcare. (By the way, next time you discuss healthcare, you might want to mention the book “Where There Is No Doctor,” a wonderful detailed resource on practical healthcare.)<br><br>Having these skills is a benefit at any age and in any circumstances.... but I don’t see them as a way to support myself in old age. When I look at the life experiences of my aging relatives and friends, if they live long enough, everyone seems to reach a point where they really cannot work. My plan was to pay off the mortgage before I retire, live on Social Security and vegetables from the back yard, and hire help when necessary in my old age. If the money I’ve saved has lost all its value, if it’s impossible for me to hire helpers, and the people who would naturally want to help me are on the east coast.... I’m going to be in trouble. <br><br>So, when you write again on this subject, I hope you will look more closely at options for elderly people as our society goes through this transition. The question I’m asking isn’t “how can I use my retirement funds to make a killing?” The question I am asking is, “what is the best way for me to survive and age gracefully during the coming decades?<br><br>Many thanks, Elaine<br><br><a href=investment-delusion.html#c8447887968237063826 title="comment permalink">3/1/09, 7:51 PM</a><br><br>

The best I could find is here:<br><br>http://www.energybulletin.net/node/17219<br><br>Most of the estimates recognized much lower payback times after including life-cycle costs - some as low as a year, although the linked survey picks one, makes a few adjustments and calls it about 4 years (a little less).<br><br>While I'm not particularly defending Odum, I can't say I'm comfortable with the lower estimate either, in large part because I can't find a simple explanation of what costs are included or how the system boundary is defined. As best I can infer from what I can find, the system boundary typically <i>includes</i> the inputs from extraction to waste disposal, but does not include the energy requirements of the equipment needed for each step along the way (manufacturing and maintenance as well as operation). So for example, it would consider the cost of fuel for the equipment which extracted the sand and transported it to the processing plant, but not the energy required to make <i>that</i> equipment (as if it were all just there). If correct, this seems a serious flaw in the typical lifecycle assessment methodology, making it not really 'life cycle' in the sense of truly understanding the overall cost required to support PV (or any product or system analyzed).<br><br>I did contact one of the co-authors of the survey I linked (Stephen Gale) for clarification on the question of system boundaries and received the following response, quite quickly to my surprise:<br><br><i>The boundary for the LCA's was generally the extraction of the raw materials at one end and the end of useful operations at the other.<br> <br>The embodies impacts of the manufacturing equipment were generally not included, though I vaguely recall one paper in which an allocation was made for plant and equipment.</i><br><br>So this seems to confirm my suspicion, but Mr. Gale goes on to note that operating costs tend to outweigh embodied costs by an order of magnitude. I'm skeptical of this too, but as I have no professional interest, I don't want to pester Mr. Gale. My reasoning is that whatever equipment is used requires the same cost analysis as the PV itself to form a true accounting - otherwise it is as if you are assuming it has always simply existed or have taken some other equally illogical step.<br><br>I'm wondering whether you have done any research or thinking on the issue, and what, if any, sources you might have to shed any light. I am of the opinion that the LCA's presented severely underestimate the costs when all factors are included (including the energy required for plant and equipment, maintenance and operation of plant and equipment and so on), but I have no real support for this view at this time.

A truly sharp, timely and knowledgeable post.<br><br>The hidden explosive social problem is that the only good investments in a contracting economy are... rentier investments. That particularly includes investments in physical commodities. <br><br>All the modern craziness about living on investments constitutes perhaps the greatest brainwash in human history, at least in numerical scope. The investment boom looked indeed good, as long as globalization could introduce a constant flow of new suckers into stock markets. This Ponzi-lite dynamics could hide stagnation of real productivity very handily. On top of that, living on growing debt became a massive norm. At the end, so many people are loosing their hard-or-smart earned savings, desired homes and retirement promises. Is this supposed to be a natural scenario? Or was the free-marketization of the last decades actually a willful radical transformation of societies around the world, like some effective Marxists claim? Special conditions of a growth economy, indeed.<br><br>Other great brainwashing meme is the competition myth. Folks are compelled to believe in a “jungle” competition for better jobs, education, cars, housing... Do poor people or countries have moments of helping to each other, doing things together? What capital of social connections can they make? Did you notice, how much more comfortable is the “competition” on elite society levels, with plenty of exchange in financial, legal, entertainment services or knowledge? That may explain, why political leaders fail to grasp or tell truths of not-so-rocket-science financial and political imbalances, or ignore concerned extrapolations so well. Hard-core rentiers are doing well in this crisis - they may not be reaping double-digit profits anymore, but they are gaining power. <br><br>Usefulness of the investing class is certainly overrated. After all, they provide only money - a “license” to act or live.

Europe, due to the relatively looser banking laws, is in even worse shape than we are. China is essentially our client, and it bids fair that she will descend into violent anarchy when we can no longer buy her exports. There were over 10,000 urban riots in China in 2005, the last year in which a count was released.<br><br>So where to invest, and when to put your money down?

I know Odum's calculations on net energy have been much criticized by solar power aficionados, who insist that the figures are much more favorable (along the lines of Gale's work). The point I'd make, though, is that we have a good general surrogate for net energy: price.

The ideas underlying it are entrenched in the American psyche as deeply as any religious belief; fitting, of course, since materialism actually is the predominant religion of American society. Even now, as "the system" is splitting seams and revealing its ugly inner workings right and left, you still hear all the same liturgy. Still almost no one seems to have noticed that the entire stock market itself is one large Ponzi scheme; even more so for the inflating housing market. We scapegoat Madoff and Stanford, yet we fail to see the parallels between their actions and those of the entire financial industry and markets taken as a whole. We still hear pundits saying that in the long term the market is always up; in particular the old (rotten) chestnut that over a decade it always makes money. Again, the plain fact that this is <i><b>a lie</b></i> is never noticed; the losses from 1929 were not recouped until the 1940s or even 1950s depending on the metric you use; adjusted for inflation there was a 2+ decade flat period from the 1960s to 1980s; and of course at the present time the markets are well down compared to 10 years ago. When I mention this to people who are "well educated" in the field, they always tell me that if I looked at broader market indices, not just the Dow, I'd get different results. Well of course, since the broader indices (like S&amp;P) were not calculated back in the 1920s-1940s! Yet this commandment is still believed devoutly by those in the industry: The Market Shall Go Up Every Decade, hence Thou Shalt Put Most of Thy Money In It. It is believed so devoutly, as devoutly as the "sacred scriptures" are believed by their followers, that those who espouse it are not even aware that they are speaking blatant falsehoods. <br><br>Like most other organized religion, the effect of mainstream economic theory and financial education is to prevent their disciples from achieving deep understanding, not to promote it.

In addition to a duplicate machine for large parts, you might want to consider getting a selection of bobbins, presser feet designed to do specialized tasks like shirring and hemming, and similar gadgets. I had an old-fashioned Singer I used for many years, and my impression is that these small accessory parts are interchangeable on many of the older Singer models. (I don’t have practical experience with White machines.) <br><br>I used to live in New York City, and had many relatives in the garment trades. The garment district in Manhattan is made of highly specialized streets (one sells lace and ornaments, one sells thread, one sells sewing machines, etc.) <br><br>If you’re seriously interested in developing this skill set for the deindustrializing future, you might want to spend some time in that neighborhood. See if you can find some old sewing machine repair guy who’s ready to go out of business and sell you his stock. I just checked over the Internet, and it looks as if the sewing machine stores are still clustered around 35th, 36th, 38th and Broadway. There might be additional clusters out in the immigrant neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens. Also, I bet there would be similar clusters in other large cities where <br>clothing is manufactured ... there was a substantial clothing industry in Los Angeles 20 years ago; I don’t know whether that’s still true today. <br><br>PS – you also want a supply of sewing machine needles. I think there was a rubber belt, too, that carries the energy to the needle. <br><br>If someone is seriously considering this as a skill for future years, you might consider old-fashioned electric machines, as well a treadle machines. They were made to last a lifetime, and I think their electricity consumption is small. Sewing is one of the skills we’ve shipped overseas. Also consider a heavy duty machine that could sew heavy fabrics.... like a big bag someone could use to haul stuff around their garden. <br><br>Good luck!<br><br><a href=investment-delusion.html#c1815369800057108992 title="comment permalink">3/2/09, 3:50 PM</a><br><br>

Thanks John.<br><br>Cannot find much to disagree with and most of the comments I’ve wanted to make were soon covered by others.<br><br>I suppose, the main overall comment I could make is that things are always more complex. For example, even in a prolonged depression there are always profitable investments, but you have to have a great deal of detailed knowledge of THAT PARTICULAR investment to pick a good investment and you have to accept that most investments will fail.<br><br>However, the days of millions of people being able to hand over their retirement savings to “someone” to “invest” in “something” and expecting to get any of their money back, let alone get lots more than they put in back, are over – possibly forever.<br><br>Problem is, problem is, they were told, promised by their governments and financial industries that this was the way to get rich and provide for their retirement. In fact they were herded into this system as governments and the financial system openly arranged laws and the economy to force them in.<br><br>One of the main reasons openly given for forcing our economies into monetary inflation (rather than the mild deflation developed economies “want” to run) is that inflation, combined with income tax on bank deposit interest, discourages people from saving (for God’s sake).<br><br>Ditto for the kind of houses they were encouraged to “invest” in: Huge, hopelessly expensive to heat/cool and maintain houses, often on tiny blocks, far out in the suburbs. Exactly the kind of houses they don’t need in an impoverished old age, and exactly the kind the younger generation won’t want to buy off them.<br><br>What I’m concerned about, is what happens when all those people realize in their hearts what has been done to them. They already sort of know in their heads, but it’s when that knowledge settles into your heart and soul that you really “know”.<br><br>We know they’ll be looking for someone to blame, some evil conspiracy of comic book villains so as to avoid accepting any responsibility for their ruin themselves. What astonishes me is that there are so many excellent prospective comic book villains still running around holding up their hands and shouting “pick me! pick me!”.<br><br>Tell you what, if I had have been in on any of the financial system Ponzi schemes I would have long since taken the $billion or so I’d looted and retired to my nice hacienda in Uruguay where I’d be concentrating on keeping my head low and becoming popular with the locals (build a few schools, support the local labor movement, be nice to my employees, you know, the usual).<br><br>I am becoming more and more afraid that in the end, the bitter end, there will be blood.<br><br><a href=investment-delusion.html#c7998413691410619077 title="comment permalink">3/2/09, 4:53 PM</a><br><br>

This is the hard reality with which all of us will have to deal.”<br><br>There is also another phenomenon acting here that would in the end produce much the same result for most people even if we were not running headlong into Peak Everything, something I was aware of from the 70s but became really conscious of when I read Peter Russell’s “The White Hole in Time”.<br><br>In short, it was getting easier and easier to produce “stuff”, even the factories to make “stuff”. As fewer and fewer people and less and less investment capital was needed wealth would tend to migrate into fewer and fewer hands and the ordinary people become surplus to requirements, their incomes would reduce, and the world, at least from the point of view of the proletariat, would enter a permanent depression .<br><br>Now the futurologists knew this as far back as the 70s, in the case of some government planners perhaps the 50s, but it was thought that systems would be introduced to force the distribution of this potentially vast wealth so that everyone had a reasonable standard of living and much more leisure, work no longer being central to life. Instead, systems were introduced that had the opposite effect, hastening the concentration of wealth into a smaller and smaller section of society.<br><br>So, even if the current financial criminal lunacy had not happened, and even if Peak Everything was not yet starting to bite, the proletariat would still get squished, if not just yet, then soon.<br><br>By the way, I believe this “getting easier to make stuff and do things” is going to continue through The Long Descent, just not as fast and not in all areas. This is one more reason why things have to be sorted out, soon: Imagine a future feudal society (which is where current trends would take us) where most of the peasants and serfs are surplus to requirements, just a nuisance to have around, except for a few needed for personal servants and sexual services.<br><br><a href=investment-delusion.html#c5232403608460194273 title="comment permalink">3/2/09, 8:39 PM</a><br><br>

Thanks for your reply and for the insights you share on your blog (still working my way back through older entries).<br><br>You make a good point with regards to the financial payback period on solar pv. Put more bluntly, if the energy payback is measured at ~2 years, the financial payback should approximate that number. Most estimates however put the financial return on solar at 10 years or more, which suggests one of two things: 1) that there are significant hidden energy costs not counted in most life-cycle assessments or 2) an energy payback of 2 years is pretty poor relative to the energy sources we currently use, and therefore solar can't support standards of living we currently have.<br><br>No need to reply - just thinking out loud.<br><br><a href=investment-delusion.html#c4391432591555102449 title="comment permalink">3/3/09, 6:55 AM</a><br><br>

After that, what businesses in your town or county need to be incubated or rescued?"<br><br>The problem of investing locally is that the policies and mindsets are not there yet to make investments at the local level to just break even. As an example, just take the food sector. It is so expensive to comply with food safety laws, there is so many loops to jump, and the overheads are unreal. And people dont want to pay the extra bucks to cover the more intensive labor. <br>Recently on MSNBC:<br>"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world’s largest retailer, said Tuesday its renewed focus on low prices paid off with a 4 percent rise in profit for its fourth quarter as holiday shoppers brought discounted groceries and home electronics as well as health and wellness products."<br><br>The economy contracting, people are flocking to where they can buy the cheapest. Its the worst path to take, but people will go there anyway. We are such an atomized society that people dont see or care how they impact on their very community. Some neighbours buy our eggs but many of them just wont because they expect we will sell for grocery price (at which we dont make a cent). Just yesterday, another one was complaining about a 6 cents increase on the milk quart, even if our neighbour wife has to work outside to keep their dairy farm. <br><br>Its a mad rush to the lifeboats and the majority dont care about who they trample on. People worry about their retirement investment, not about where their food and fuel will come tomorrow, or climate change or peak oil. At this point in time, small producers just cant compete in the larger economy. I am worried about how organic farmers, small cheesemakers etc. will do in the near future, if the demand for higher end products will keep increasing or just dry out. Hopefully, they will have the financial strenght to make it through the bottleneck.<br>I tend to believe that this is just like a forest wild fire. Lots need to burn before the seeds of an alternative system can sprout. Some pine seeds remain dormant until the fire has run its course. The changes are so fast and chaotic right now. Whatever people get into, make sure it pays you right now to do it. Dont invest your resources with the idea there is a market now or in the next few years. For example, learn how to garden to feed yourself and your family, learn how to sew if you will clothe yourself. All kind of small scale industries like mills, woodshops, cold-pressing for oil, etc...would be more than useful for the new economy, but I dont think their time has come yet. To use another metaphor, dont plant the tomatoes out before the last frost is passed. And yes, keep investing in CSAs and other valuable local businesses but be prudent for larger investments. The head of the giant industrial/financial chicken has been cut, but there will be some serious trashing around before it is all said and done.<br><br><a href=investment-delusion.html#c202830166708052250 title="comment permalink">3/3/09, 7:34 AM</a><br><br>

I've been thinking of the confluence of our concepts of money, wealth and ecological wealth in particular. Sure there's the non-renewables like fossil fuel that have seen quite a bit of scrutiny and even occupy a popular gauge on the dashboard of life, both in value and how much is left in the tank so to speak. <br><br>It seems to me that it's a fallacy that we are getting wealthier in any form when divided by renewing ecological forms. Fresh water aquifers, topsoil, fisheries, etc seem to be getting strip mined, poisoned or paying much fewer "divedends". Divide that amongst a growing population and the wealth of nations might have been written by Malthus instead. :/<br><br>Anyway, great comments on this as well. Very much like Bill Pulliams observations on his first post on the community unit of survival. Also, Ricardo Rollos comments about nitrates made me wonder if there's been anyone out there that has created habitats for bats in order to harvest their nitrate/phosphorous rich guano for fertilizer.

My entire lifes savings was lost in the forced sell of my house in Medford. Something that weighs heavily as I have been saying for years that real property that you can do things with is probably the only real security in ones future.

In Brazil there is a concern prompting a call to limit foreign investment in purchasing land there. Their succesfull Ethanol industry has prompted purchases of their farm property by foreign interests. http://www.mstbrazil.org/?q=node/568 Regulating and limiting these purchases protects local interests.<br><br>Looking at our own crash and the number of foreclosures and over extended properties in the US shows another phenomenon. A large increase in foreign interests purchasing us agriculture and residential properties.

Especially prophetic was the chapter "De-massifying the Media" from <i>The Third Wave</i>, in which he predicted as communications technologies improve the days of true "mass media" will come to an end. Since the publication of <i>The Third Wave</i> in 1979, the rise of home video record/playback systems, multichannel cable and satellite TV, the maturation of the home computer from desktop systems all the way down to your cellphone and the rise of the public Internet has made his prophecy a modern reality. The rapid decline of newspapers in recent years is proof that modern communications has effectively "de-massified the media."<br><br><i>The Third Wave</i> also talks about the potential end of the petroleum age (this book was written at the time of the second oil shock in 1979-1980).
