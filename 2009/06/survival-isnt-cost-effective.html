I trust my readers won’t be unduly distressed by an extended safari through the tangled jungles of the “dismal science” of economics. As suggested in several recent <i>Archdruid Report</i> posts, economic factors have played a massive role in putting the industrial world in its current predicament, and an even more substantial role in blocking any constructive attempt to get out of the corner into which we’ve painted ourselves. There’s an all too real sense in which, if modern industrial civilization perishes, it will be because the steps necessary for its survival weren’t cost-effective enough.<br><br>Mind you, this can be interpreted in at least two different ways, and both of them are relevant to the crisis of the industrial world. Like any other science, economics is a set of hypothetical models that reflect, with more or less exactness, the observed behavior of the world. Too often the models get confused with the reality, and understanding suffers.<br><br>In a different context, that of the physics of vacuum tubes, Philip Partner commented in his classic textbook <i>Electronics</i> (1950): “The theory speaks of ions, atoms, and electrons, and of collisions between them; but these are figments of the mind, props for its understanding. [...] The electron, like the atom, is a concept; it is part of a mental shorthand which we have invented to summarize our knowledge of Nature. So when we say, for example, that an electron collides with an atom, we should bear in mind that we have never seen it happen. The use of the present indicative does not turn hypothesis into fact” (p. 569). Unfortunately this level of clarity is hard to achieve and harder to maintain.<br><br>This has to be kept in mind when trying to make sense of the economic dimension of industrial civilization’s decline and fall, because both sides of the equation – the models and the reality – throw up challenges in the way of constructive action, and so do economic policies that are based on the models, and thus function at a second remove from the reality. It’s true, and will be a central theme of future posts, that current economic theory has lost touch with reality in critical ways, and a revision of some of the basic ideas of modern economics is essential if we’re to make sense of our predicament and do anything constructive in response to it. It’s equally true that government policies based on today’s misguided economic notions have become massive liabilities to societies struggling to deal with today’s crisis, and even this late in the game, changes in these policies might still do a great deal of good. Still, it’s also true that economic factors in the real world, independent of theory, impose hard limits on what can be done.<br><br>The classic example has to be the plethora of projects for “lifeboat communities” floated in recent years. The basic idea seems plausible enough at first glance: to preserve lives and knowledge through the decline and fall of the industrial age, establish a network of self-sufficient communities in isolated rural areas, equipped with the tools and technology they will need to maintain a tolerable standard of living in difficult times. The trouble comes, as it usually does, when it’s time to tot up the bill. The average lifeboat community project I’ve seen would cost well over $10 million to establish – many would cost a great deal more – and I have yet to see such a project that provides any means for its inhabitants to cover those costs and pay their bills in the years before industrial civilization goes away.<br><br>The unstated assumption seems to be that as soon as the intrepid residents of such a community move into their solar-heated cohousing units, start up the wind turbines and the methane generators, and get to work harvesting tree crops from the permacultured landscaping all around, industrial civilization will disappear in a puff of smoke and take its taxes, debts, and miscellaneous expenses with it. Pleasant though the prospect might seem, I am sorry to say that this isn’t going to happen. The residents of any lifeboat community founded today will not only have to come up somehow with the very substantial sums needed to buy the land, build the cohousing units, wind turbines and so on, and plant all that permaculture landscaping; they will also have to earn a living during the long transitional process that leads from the world we inhabit today to the conditions that will pertain at the bottom of the curve of decline. Some awareness of these difficulties may go a long way to explain why, of the great number of lifeboat communities that have been proposed over the last decade or two, the number that have actually been built can be counted on the fingers of one foot.<br><br>Economic forces constrain the future in more global ways as well. Not many people seem to have noticed, for instance, that the grim scenario traced out in the seminal 1973 study <i>The Limits to Growth</i> – still the most plausible map of the future ahead of us, and thus inevitably the most bitterly vilified – is driven by simple economics. As resources deplete, that study pointed out, the cost of keeping resources flowing into to the economy will increase in real terms, as more labor and capital have to be invested to extract a given amount of each resource; as pollution levels rise, in turn, the costs of mitigating their impacts on public health, agricultural productivity, and other core economic factors go up in the same way, and for the same reasons. Those costs have to be paid out of current economic output, leaving less and less for other uses, until economic output itself begins to fall and the industrial world begins its terminal decline.<br><br>Now it’s easy to insist, if you ignore the economic dimension, that a society facing this sort of crisis can save itself by launching a massive program to build nuclear reactors, solar thermal power plants, algal biodiesel, or what have you, and of course this sort of claim has seen endless rehashing over the last couple of decades. The problem is that massive programs of this sort pile additional demands on an already faltering economy. Any such program has to be paid for, after all, and by this I don’t mean that money has to be found for it; in today’s mostly hallucinatory economic climate, conjuring money out of thin air is easy enough. No, it has to be paid out of current economic output, which is much less flexible, and already has to cover the rising costs of resource depletion and pollution. This is the trap hidden in the limits to growth; once those limits begin to bite, the spare economic capacity that would be needed to build one’s way out of trouble no longer exists.<br><br>Thus there are limits hardwired into our situation by the inflexible realities that surround us, and we have already strayed far enough over those limits that the payback will inevitably be harsh. At the same time, other forces pushing us in the same direction are a product of economic misunderstandings, and in the way these misunderstandings are reflected in public policy. Those could conceivably be changed in time to matter.<br><br>Resource depletion and pollution, the driving forces behind the <i>Limits to Growth</i> scenario, are particularly vexed issues in today’s economic thought. As we’ve seen, both of these factors impose costs, potentially drastic ones, on the economy. Under current economic arrangements, however, <i>those costs are not charged to the people who benefit from the activities in question</i>. The owner of an oil well gets the economic benefits of pumping oil out of the ground, but does not have to pay for the impact today’s extraction will have on tomorrow’s economy. (For many years, in fact, government policies in most of the world’s industrial nations have actually rewarded oil well owners for accelerating the depletion of this nonrenewable resource and imposing massive costs on the future.) In the same way, the owner of a smokestack that dumps pollution into the atmosphere gets the economic benefits of whatever activity produces the pollution, but does not have to pay for the costs incurred as a result of the pollution. This asymmetry has at least two results. First and most obviously, neither the oil well owner nor the smokestack owner has any incentive to decrease the negative impacts of his or her activities. Still, the second and in some ways more important result is that the long-term economic burdens of depletion and pollution are not included in measures of the relative economic costs and benefits of the well or the smokestack.<br><br>The result is a massive distortion in our understanding of the realities that shape our lives. It’s generally not considered a viable business plan – outside of the financial industry, that is – to make large profits in the short term by running up debts so large the business will have to declare bankruptcy in the not too distant future. Yet this is exactly what an economic system that ignores the cumulative costs of resource depletion and pollution mitigation is doing, and on an even larger scale. The future costs of extracting resources from depleted reserves and mitigating the impacts of a polluted environment have the same effect as the future costs of debt service on excessive borrowing; they buy temporary prosperity in the near future at the cost of impoverishment or collapse further down the road.<br><br>Garret Hardin’s famous essay “The Tragedy of the Commons” addressed this issue some years back. Hardin showed that in a situation where the benefits from exploiting a resource went to individuals, but the costs were spread throughout the community, individuals intent on maximizing their own individual benefit would overexploit the resource and suffer drastic losses in the longer run. His logic was impeccable, and there are plenty of real-world examples of resource exhaustion driven by this very process, but it has been pointed out by his critics with equal relevance that resources held in common have in fact been managed sustainably in countless cases around the world and throughout history. The question that has to be asked is where the difference comes in.<br><br>This is where the divide pointed up earlier in this essay – the gap between economic realities and the models our society uses to understand them and predict their effects – comes into play. Hardin was quite correct that when individuals got the benefits of resource exploitation without paying their fair share of the costs to the community, exhaustion of the resource follows. Those societies that have managed resources in common successfully, in turn, found ways to make those who gained the benefits of resource exploitation pay a commensurate share of the costs. The collective understanding of economics in these societies, in other words, and the social policies that shaped economic behavior, took the tragedy of the commons into account and adjusted the customs and laws governing economic exchanges accordingly.<br><br>As we make the transition from what I’ve called the abundance economies of the first half of the industrial age to the scarcity industrialism of the near and middle future, it’s entirely possible that such adjustments could be put into place in our own societies. The accumulated burdens of past mistakes weigh heavily enough on the future that changes of this sort won’t stave off a great deal of trouble and suffering, but it’s entirely possible that a shift to saner policies backed by more realistic economic ideas could cushion the descent into the deindustrial age, and make it easier to allocate resources to projects that will actually do some good, instead of pursuing policies which – like nearly all the economic policies currently in place in the industrial world – will simply make matters worse.

We, in the US, have made some progress toward protecting the commons -- we now have pollution and conservation laws that have done a great deal toward restoring air, water and land quality, but to do more in hard economic times is, sadly, more than I believe the American public is willing to do. Unfortunately, the costs associated with depletion and pollution would be paid, ultimately, by the consumer, and higher prices are the last thing anyone is going to want as buying power diminishes. Of course, one could argue, rightly, that the consumer is already paying the costs -- but hidden costs are more appealing than visibile ones. <br><br>So while I agree with everything you wrote, JMG, when I step back and ask myself "could this happen?" the answer is "don't count on it!"

You have pointed out a blind spot in economics. But don’t apologize for discussing the “dismal science.” For there is also a blind spot in our culture for economics itself, and we all need a good dose. After all, economics is arguably the reason behind every decision people make! <br>I think the media certainly has a large share of the blame, focusing as it does on gossip instead of relevant information (how many news outlets paid attention in 1999 when sections of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 were repealed, contributing to the current financial crisis by permitting, among other things, Citibank’s current formation). <br>The school system is also partially to blame, but that’s probably just a reflection on our culture. Instead of studying economic history, we study social history, and therefore even in school we are trained to focus on scapegoats and champions, instead of the actual reasons behind it all. There are numerous examples in our textbooks where heroes or villains get all the credit while underlying economic reasons are ignored. If asked, most Americans would probably blame the French Revolution on Marie Antionette being such a jerk, rather than poor agricultural policies which limited French food production (in sharp contrast to England’s food production). We all collectively suffer a little from this blind spot.<br><br><a href=survival-isnt-cost-effective.html#c5364436640820330366 title="comment permalink">6/18/09, 7:47 AM</a><br><br>

My guess is it'll be a while before ideas like these get any traction with national governments, but regional and local governments are another matter. The first step is to get them in circulation. <br><br>Robert, quite possibly -- minus the propane, but very likely plus radio.<br><br>Daughter, the thing about economics is that a good theory gives a competitive advantage to those people, communities and nations that adopt it. We're already seeing countries (China and Russia, in particular) adapting to the new reality of scarcity industrialism, and profiting mightily at the expense of those countries that aren't willing to do so. I'll have some specific proposals to offer later on; if I'm right -- always a caveat worth making -- the payoffs to be had by adopting them may be tempting enough to encourage people and communities to look into them. <br><br>RDatta, anathema is my stock in trade! <br><br>Llewellyn, many thanks. <br><br>Hapibeli, I think the only thing I can add is "heh heh heh." <br><br>Peter, I disagree. It's exactly the unwillingness of the scientific community to tackle the grubby realities of economics (while lining up to feed at assorted government and corporate troughs) that has negated any influence the scientific community might have had on public affairs. I don't think waiting around for a black swan is particularly useful; what's needed, rather, is a set of good reasons why it's in people's own economic interest to do the right thing -- and I propose to provide that. <br><br>Blue Sun, exactly! The blind spot toward economics is particularly severe in the peak oil community, it seems to me, and that above all has to change. In a society where economic concerns override most other factors, we need to learn how to talk in the language of costs and benefits, prosperity and impoverishment, or nobody's going to listen -- and the economic impact of the end of the industrial age is significant enough (!) that this won't be hard.<br><br><a href=survival-isnt-cost-effective.html#c3089100169287780118 title="comment permalink">6/18/09, 8:39 AM</a><br><br>

I am exhausted at the end of the week. <br><br>What I SHOULD be doing on the weekend is driving around, comparing land, hydrology and soil types. What I ACTUALLY do is recover. Read quietly, walk my dog. Research some more. Recharge enough to return on Monday. <br><br>I SHOULD have everything bought and paid for by the time I am ready to chuck it. Not a prayer of doing that.<br><br>What will likely happen? I'll leave at the appointed time. THEN I'll do the driving around. Without an income, I'll make many compromises buying for cash. Then the financial drain of fitting up. What a nightmare. There is no prospect of a "do-over" if I make a grave mistake. People and places are always hospitable and welcoming on the front end. You don't find the skeletons in the closet till you've lived there some.<br><br>Woulda, coulda, shoulda. We are not going to get government programs to subsidize experiments that contravene archetypal beliefs. That is, our society is a going concern on an upward trajectory, once this temporary hiccup is resolved.<br><br>Poetic justice, perhaps. We boomers have been vilified for hogging the resources of the succeeding generations. My prospective giveback: I will beggar myself to establish a sustainable family compound, assuming they are not slackers who piss it away before it is really needed.<br><br>JMG, I'm with you that this will unwind in a slow decline. There is virtually nothing in your book with which I disagree.<br><br><a href=survival-isnt-cost-effective.html#c4305768898134755930 title="comment permalink">6/20/09, 8:59 PM</a><br><br>

The Germans are actually pretty good at this, and at doing infrastructure in the less-industrial parts of the world.

Unfortunately, the American society is not one of the kind. All politics and economics is very social there, shockingly! Resources, common prosperity, economic stability or sustainability - these are things that “no one” has to worry about. The strongest concern is... relative well-being of so-called winners. Whatever they have, however they got it, and whatever communities need - the “competitive advantage” of those winners must be protected (even if that means an end of the actual “competition”, or even an end of the world). Try to argue against that!<br><br>Most attention in the 20th century economics went to satisfying needs of over-producing industries. Not human needs here and there, but corporate needs of profit (and that does not guarantee a lifespan of good living on the planet, however we try to believe in "invisible hands"). Now the focus goes in satisfying "needs" of the finacial industry, or investors. Who else gets the alchemy of money, or possible relations between money and producing economy? <br><br>One inspiring "lifeboat community" example: when the US won the independence, the Bank of England offered money to borrow. The founding fathers said "Thanks, we can print money ourselves" ;-)<br><br><a href=survival-isnt-cost-effective.html#c6879771433338371279 title="comment permalink">6/22/09, 7:56 AM</a><br><br>

Some of his ideas are very interesting, indeed. However, he travels with severe blinders on. I tried to start a discussion on the influence of females on the psychological evolution of human society. My idea is that the human race has been self domesticating over the past few hundred thousand years and that the influence of women over the life of the small but growing prehistoric communities was mostly responsible for this tempering of what was otherwise a brutal, male mindset. Jay not only utterly rejected even the idea of such a possibility, but he would not allow the discussion to get as far as his blog. To him (by his own admission) male violence is the only significant factor in human evolution and females appear to be no more than decorative penis sheaths.<br><br>I think there is more to it than this.<br><br>Jon.<br><br><a href=survival-isnt-cost-effective.html#c8501369640606751174 title="comment permalink">6/22/09, 7:58 AM</a><br><br>

Try to hook up with some folks young and energetic enough to be happy exploring and creating on a shoestring, and some recently retired folks with time and still enough energy to take on a new venture, and some folks in roughly your own situation with whom you can pool resources and divide up tasks. No guarantee, of course, but if you can find a group of like-minded folks, the burden won't seem so heavy.<br><br>Not that this is easy or quick. Just getting a group together and learning to cooperate, collaborate, and co-create will be a serious endeavor. If you're interested in going that direction, though, I recommend Shaffer and Amundsen's book "Creating Community Anywhere" as a resource.<br><br>Whatever your path, I wish you well.<br><br><a href=survival-isnt-cost-effective.html#c3129397980612712061 title="comment permalink">6/22/09, 12:57 PM</a><br><br>

I would like to ask that you try to keep things more concrete so that those of us who are economically uneducated can follow along.<br><br>As far as I have been able to figure out, economists are people you take your vice to so they can wave their hands and say "Hocus pocus, economies of scale" and turn it into a virtue. I don't doubt that there probably is more to it but it is mainly a mystery to me.<br><br>I am continuously frustrated by economists who talk about "the economy" when they seem to mean "the economic <i>status quo</i>". When they talk about "economic collapse" they seem to mean a decline in the amount of current economic activity. Since most current economic activity involves producing things we don't need or would be better off without (think weapons or automobiles), I don't find that all that alarming. If instead they said that what was going to happen was that the loss of the efficiencies associated with the economies of scale brought about by the current level of economic activity would result in more resources having to be devoted to the production of those things that are actually needed, I might understand. This, however, might suggest another way of dealing with the situation than when they threaten "economic collapse" as this just seems to call for panic.<br><br>In this weeks post you speak of alternate sources of energy as having to be paid for "out of current economic output." I hope I'm not the only one who has difficulty understanding this. We spend almost a trillion dollars per year on military activities that have nothing to do with defending the country and who knows how much money using an industrial infrastructure that would be well suited to producing trains and busses to produce automobiles. Is this not current economic output that could be diverted to producing alternatives?<br><br>I am not trying to be difficult nor am I feigning ignorance. I have spent more time than I care to admit trying to understand these things.<br><br><a href=survival-isnt-cost-effective.html#c3218628775868087371 title="comment permalink">6/22/09, 2:45 PM</a><br><br>

Behaving in strange, but experimentally demonstrable ways: if one ever came to a complete standstill it would occupy an infinite volume of space, but with zero probability of being found at any given spot therein. <br><br>There has to be a lesson in there somewhere, but I'm not sure just what... perhaps in keeping with your essay, that our economy of "growth" and the wonderful benefits of "scale" are wrong as well.<br><br><a href=survival-isnt-cost-effective.html#c6043198803168125613 title="comment permalink">6/22/09, 6:06 PM</a><br><br>

What dominates American society is a very narrow and ideological concept of economics -- one that leaves out most of the things people actually value. More on this in later posts. <br><br>Jon, I have to admit I have my doubts about the claim that there's a "male mindset" that is innately brutal -- how is it that the simpleminded Victorian notion that men are naturally brutal and savage, and women are naturally peaceful, kind and good, suddenly became cutting edge ideology on the left? Still, I'd noticed the aspect of Hanson's discourse that you've referenced, and yes, it's problematic. <br><br>Dwig, good. The community, rather than the individual, is the basic unit of human survival. <br><br>Robert, you're asking a perfectly reasonable question. The answer is that those billions of dollars spent on weapons and troops are the sole remaining basis for America's prosperity. The 5% of the world's population that lives in the US uses around a third of the world's energy, resources, and industrial production. This doesn't happen because the rest of the world loves us; it happens because we have a global empire, with troops on the ground in 140 countries, maintaining profoundly unbalanced patterns of exchange that bring most of the world's wealth to the US and its satellite countries, such as Britain and Australia. <br><br>In theory, we could replace all those tanks and bombers with solar panels and wind turbines. In practice, if we did so, the US' share of the world's resource base and industrial product would soon drop to a tiny fraction of its current level, which means a third world economy in which solar panels and wind turbines would become unaffordable luxuries, and you and I would be spending our time trying to scrape together enough food to eat rather than debating these issues on the internet. Nor would this bring an end to inequitable distribution of the world's resources; there are already a good many candidates vying for the position of the next global empire.<br><br>That's a measure of the corner we've backed ourselves into. It doesn't make it any better that our empire is going to go down the drain soon anyway, I know. <br><br>DIYer, exactly! The gross national product is as mythical as the neat orbit of a Bohr electron -- that is, it's a model that represents experience, and not necessarily all that well. More on this later.<br><br><a href=survival-isnt-cost-effective.html#c794094245737555245 title="comment permalink">6/22/09, 9:37 PM</a><br><br>
