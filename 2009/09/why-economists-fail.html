The last two posts here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i>, while they dealt with issues that are becoming increasingly hard to avoid as industrial society begins its long slide down the slopes of Hubbert’s peak, were something of a distraction from the theme I’ve been trying to pursue for the last few months, the theme of deindustrial economics. I want to return to that theme here, and continue exploring the possibilities and risks of economic life in an age of decline.<br><br>Mind you, it may have occurred to many of my readers – and it has certainly occurred to me – that there’s something distinctly odd about an archdruid setting aside his white robe and oaken staff for the chalk and blackboard of the economics classroom. I am not an economist; I don’t even play one on television, and my background in economics consists mostly of extensive reading and study in what nowadays would be considered the fringes of the subject – most notably the writings of the late E.F. Schumacher, which set this sequence of posts in motion.<br><br>Yet there’s a case to be made for discussing economics from a standpoint distinct from that of today’s economists – in fact, from nearly any imaginable standpoint other than that of today’s economists. That case could draw its initial arguments from many points, but the most obvious one just now has to be the near-total failure of contemporary economic thought to provide meaningful guidance to the macroeconomic challenges of our time.<br><br>This may seem like an extreme statement, but the facts back it up. Consider the way that economists responded – or, rather, failed to respond – to the late housing boom. This was as close to a perfect textbook example of a speculative bubble as you’ll find in recent history. The very extensive literature on speculative bubbles, going back all the way to Mackay’s <i>Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds</i>, made recognizing another example of the species easy enough. All the signs were there: the dizzying price increases, the huge influx of amateur investors, the giddy rhetoric insisting that prices could and would keep on rising forever, the soaring rate of speculation using borrowed money, and the rest of it.<br><br>By 2005, accordingly, a good many people outside the economics profession were commenting on parallels between the housing bubble and other speculative binges; by 2006 the blogosphere was abuzz with accurate predictions of the approaching crash; by 2007 the final plunge into mass insolvency and depression was treated in many circles as a foregone conclusion – as indeed it was by then. Yet it’s a matter of public record that among those who issued these warnings, economists – who should have caught onto the bubble faster than anyone – could very nearly be counted on the fingers of one foot. On the contrary, the vast majority of the economists who expressed a public opinion on the subject insisted that the delirious rise in real estate prices was justified and that the exotic financial innovations that drove the bubble would keep banks and mortgage companies safe from harm.<br><br>These comforting announcements were wrong. Those who made them had every reason to know at the time that they were wrong. No less an economic luminary than John Kenneth Galbraith pointed out decades ago that in the financial world, the term “innovation” usually refers to the rediscovery of the same limited set of bad ideas that always, without exception, lead to economic disaster. Galbraith’s books <i>The Great Crash 1929</i> and <i>A Short History of Financial Panics</i>, which chronicle the carnage caused by the same gimmicks in the past, can be found on the library shelves in every school of economics in North America, and anyone who reads either one can find every rhetorical excess and fiscal idiocy of the housing bubble faithfully duplicated in the great speculative binges of the past.<br><br>If this were an isolated instance of failure, it might be pardonable, but the same pattern repeats itself as regularly as speculative bubbles themselves. Identical assurances were offered – in some cases, by the identical economists – during the last great speculative binge in American economic life, the tech-stock bubble of 1996-2000. They have been offered by professional economists during every other speculative binge since the profession of economics came into being. Take a wider view, and you’ll find that whenever a professional economist assures the public that some apparently risky course of action is perfectly safe, he is usually wrong.<br><br>A colorful recent example was the self-destruction of Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) in the early 1990s. One of the two Nobel laureates in economics on LTCM’s staff announced publicly that the computer models the company used for its hugely leveraged trades were so good that they could not lose money in the lifetime of the universe. Have you ever noticed that villains in bad movies very often get blown to smithereens a few seconds after saying “I am invincible”? Apparently the same principle applies to economists, though the time lag is longer; it was, as I recall, some five years after this announcement that LTCM got blindsided by a Russian foreign-loan default that many other people saw coming, and failed catastrophically. The US government had to arrange a hurried rescue package to keep the implosion from causing a general financial panic.<br><br>Economists are not, by and large, stupid people. Those who work in some of the less glamorous subsets of the field have worked out a great many useful tools for businesses and individuals, and the level of mathematical skill to be found among today’s “quants” rivals that of many university physics departments. Yet the profession seems to have become incapable of learning from its most glaring and highly publicized mistakes. This is all the more troubling in that you’ll find many economists among the pundits who insist that industrial economies need not trouble themselves about the impact of limitless economic growth on the biosphere that supports all our lives. If they’re as wrong about that as so many other economists were about the housing bubble, they’ve made a fateful leap from risking billions of dollars to risking billions of lives.<br><br>What lies behind this startling blindness to the evidence of history and the reality of the downside? Plenty of factors doubtless play a part, but three seem most important to me.<br><br>First of all, for professional economists, <i> being wrong is much more lucrative than being right.</i> During the runup to a speculative binge, and even more so during the binge itself, a great many people are willing to pay handsomely to be told that throwing their money into the speculation du jour is the right thing to do. Very few people are willing to pay to be told that they might as well flush it down the toilet, even – indeed, especially – when this is the case. During and after the crash, by contrast, most people have enough calls on their remaining money that paying economists to say anything at all is low on the priority list. <br><br>The same rule applies to professorships at universities, positions at brokerages, and many of the other sources of income open to economists. When markets are rising, those who encourage people to indulge their fantasies of overnight wealth will be far more popular, and thus more employable, than those who warn them of the inevitable outcome of pursuing such fantasies; when markets are plunging, and the reverse might be true, nobody’s hiring. Apply the same logic to the fate of industrial society and the results are much the same; those who promote policies that allow people to get rich and live extravagantly today can count on an enthusiastic response, even if those same policies condemn industrial society to a death spiral in the decades ahead. Posterity, it’s worth remembering, pays nobody’s salaries today.<br><br>Second, like many contemporary fields of study, <i>economics suffers from a bad case of premature scientification.</i> The dazzling achievements of science have encouraged scholars in a great many fields to ape science’s methods in the hope of duplicating its successes, or at least cashing in on its prestige. Before Isaac Newton could make sense of the planets in their courses, though, thousands of observational astronomers had to amass the raw data with which he worked. The same thing is true of any successful science: what used to be called “natural history,” the systematic recording of what nature actually does, builds the foundation on which science erects structures of hypothesis and experiment. <br><br>A great many fields of study have attempted to skip the preliminaries and fling themselves straight into scientific research. The results are not good, because there’s a boobytrap hidden inside the scientific method. The fact that you can get some fraction of nature to behave in a certain way under arbitrary conditions in the artificial setting of a laboratory does not mean that nature behaves that way left to herself. If all you want to know is what you can force a given fraction of nature to do, this is well and good, but if you want to understand how the world works, the fact that you can often force nature to conform to your theory is not exactly helpful. <br><br>Economics is particularly vulnerable to this sort of malign feedback because its raw material – human beings making economic decisions – is so complex that the only way to control all the variables is to impose conditions so arbitrary and rigid that the results have only the most distant relation to the real world. The logical way out of this trap is to concentrate on the equivalent of natural history, which is economic history: the record of what has actually happened in human communities under different economic conditions. This is exactly what those who predicted the housing crash did: they noted that a set of conditions in the past (a bubble) consistently led to a common result (a crash) and used that knowledge to make accurate predictions about the future.<br><br>Yet this is not, on the whole, what successful economists do nowadays. Instead, a great many of them spend their careers generating elaborate theories and quantitative models that are rarely tested against the evidence of economic history. The result is that when those theories are tested against the evidence of today’s economic realities, they often fail.<br><br>The Nobel laureates whose computer models brought LTCM crashing down in flames, for example, created what amounted to extremely complex hypotheses about economic behavior, and put those hypotheses to a very expensive test, which they failed. If they had taken the time to study economic history first, they might well have noticed that politically unstable countries tolerably often default on their debts, that moneymaking schemes involving huge amounts of other people’s money usually end up imploding messily, and that every previous attempt to profit by modeling the market’s vagaries had come to grief when confronted by the sheer cussedness of human beings making decisions about their money. They did not notice these things, and so they and their investors ended up losing astronomical amounts of money.<br><br>The third factor driving the economic profession’s blindness to its own mistakes is more complex, and will demand a post of its own. Few things seem less related than the abstractions of metaphysics and the gritty realities of money, but there’s a crucial connection. Underlying today’s economic thought is a specific set of metaphysical assumptions, and those assumptions form the foundation of sand underneath the proud and unsteady towers of today’s economic theories. In next week’s post I plan on taking a hard look at the metaphysics of money, in the hope of finding a less problematic basis for economic life in the approaching deindustrial age.

The proper name for the prize is "<a href="http://www.riksbank.com/templates/Page.aspx?id=20286" rel=nofollow>The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel</a>" and this prize was not instituted by Alfred Nobel himself, but rather by the Swedish central bank in 1969. In this way they used the good name of Alfred Nobel to lend some glamour to their economics prize.

Over the past few years in particular it has become apparent even to me, whose eyes glaze over a the slightest passing mention of recondite financial instruments, that there is something seriously wrong with the putative science of economics, and I now more than suspect that it is rather some kind of scientistic projection of an ideology. <br><br><i>...being wrong is much more lucrative than being right.</i><br><br>I seem to recall that you yourself have cited the quote which states that it is difficult to make a man understand something when his livelihood depends upon his not understanding it. I suspect that the reasons of economists for not predicting the housing crash are similar to the reasons of petrochemical and government scientists for arguing over more than twenty years that anthoropogenic global warming is a myth based on premature conclusions drawn from flawed or incomplete date, and that besides it's bound to be beneficial. <br><br><i>...like many contemporary fields of study, economics suffers from a bad case of premature scientification.</i> <br><br>I feel certain that is true. The same applies to psychology, as Aldous Huxley pointed out in one of his essays, in which he observed that Dickens and other writers of his time were far subtler psychologists than psychiatric writers of the day. A false sense of pseudo-scientific certitude characterizes that discipline down to our time, and the same appears to be true of economics. <br><br><i>Posterity, it’s worth remembering, pays nobody’s salaries today.</i><br><br>I myself have independently observed this. I can hardly help noticing posterity's dilatoriness in recompensing the legacy of art I have sought to bestow upon it, and gather that I am not the first painter to have had this experience.<br><br><a href=#c4079875851069139202 title="comment permalink">9/24/09, 12:35 AM</a><br><br>

Their 'guru' came out and said they wouldn't lose money within the lifetime of this universe, and in spite of the obvious fact that the human species and its concept of money will have vanished long before the universe comes to an end, they failed to call him a quack and run for their lives (or for their money, as the case may be). No sympathy from me there. <br><br>Second, thanks for your discussion of the first two reasons that economists fail. The first one (that being wrong is more lucrative than being right) was obvious to me even before you pointed it out, but the second one (the premature scientification) clarified a lot of things for me.

I suppose every profession has its own set of 'tendencies to err' but economists are a particularly admirable lot in this respect, aren't they? Not only do they consistently make the same mistakes but, as you point out, they are also consistently emboldened by them, as opposed to being chastened.<br><br>The 3 factors you lay out to explain this sorry state of affairs are convincing and the third one certainly deserves the extra weighting you intend to give it.<br><br>Indeed, the habit of looking at the world through the prism (or should that be 'prison'?) of an economic ideology and its bottom-line obsessions has become so pervasive that it might be termed the 'default mindset' of so-called post-modern societies. And those close enough to the core "value proposition" of this arrangement are sure to benefit, in the short term, whatever that means. The adjective 'parasitical' immediately springs to mind. When anyone is in a position to 'externalize' the costs and reap all the lucre, they're bound to get fat and, over time, no doubt sassy as well. Economist Michael Hudson mentions another common feature of parasites: they trick the host into thinking that they're actually doing her a favor!<br><br>What cost-benefit analysis doesn't want to see, however, is much more important than what it does see. Namely that they, the clever economists, quants, model-makers and market-makers share the same biosphere as the rest of us. Which means that, however brilliant the algorithms may be, finding ingenious new ways to trash the Earth whilst calling it 'creating value' bodes extremely ill for future generations, including the offspring of said geniuses. The fact is that nothing can really be 'externalized' at all, simply because there's nowhere for it to go - nowhere for it to be other than here on this planet! The British have an expression: "Too clever by half," which gets part of the picture but perhaps 13th Century French poet put it better when he wrote: "Con est l'oiseau qui chie dans son propre nid." My translation: "It's a dumb bird that fouls its own nest."<br><br>Respectfully,<br>Gav<br><br><a href=#c2958124914730533996 title="comment permalink">9/24/09, 2:16 PM</a><br><br>

Despite forced public vaccination in Europe in the mid-late 1800s, there was no reduction in Smallpox until cities moved to modern sewerage systems around the turn of the century. Doctors also began washing their hands, which helped hospital death rates decline (when hand washing was first suggested it was ridiculed by the medical profession). Those counties/towns that did not take up vaccination, but concentrated on other methods to prevent the spread did much better than those that relied on vaccination.<br><br>The mortality rates for all other diseases declined massively before vaccines for them were introduced. The one exception is Polio, but there the definition of the disease was changed (twice, I believe) after the vaccination was introduced, and DDT, a likely exacerbator, was banned a few years before (polio incidence surged after the introduction of DDT and was in decline the year after DDT was banned - before the vaccine was made). Without the vaccination the definition change alone would have wiped out over 90% of cases...<br><br>Current study reviews show that the flu vaccine does nothing to reduce the mortality rate form the disease.<br><br>Sanitation, clean water, and food, is what prevents the majority of infectious disease. Antibiotics have been a great help too, but they are overused and have lost much of their effectiveness due to the resistant bugs that have developed as a result of this overuse.<br><br><a href=#c1325194958442964420 title="comment permalink">9/24/09, 7:19 PM</a><br><br>

I enjoyed it thoroughly. With no disrespect meant, I have to say that for me you are preaching to the choir. I started with Jay Hanson's site dieoff.org in the 90s and have read William Catton's Overshoot plus several books and blogs on peak oil. We have truly hit the wall in energy, food, water the environment, finance and that giant elephant in the room, population. <br><br>If it's not too late to comment on that thread I have two points I'd like to add. 1. while it may be worthwhile to assess general probabilities, it is too chaotic to make any kind of analysis as to how the coming collapse will play out. 2. I don't think we differ from any other species in our response to the discovery of an abundant resource and having the ability to remove population limiting factors such as environment and predators. <br><br>We focus so much on "human exceptionalism" that we rarely realize that as a species we don't behave much differently than bacteria or fruit flies. Thus our trajectory through bloom--overshoot---dieoff would fit the same graph as any other species. <br><br>We think there was a point at which we could have rescued our situation but there was not---not in any real sense. Nothing in any of the ways in which we've organized our lives, politically, economically, socially would allow for the logic of how to achieve sustainability to take hold. <br><br>Our intelligence and ingenuity is just an artifact, albeit a wonderful one if you like whizzing around the world sampling its myriad delights. <br> <br>On economists, add that they are indoctrinated into mystical priestly concepts in university such as the sanctity of "the market" and other such non-negotiable beliefs. <br><br>I look forward to reading many more of your posts.

Stay tuned to next week!<br><br>Prizm, I'd say it's more a case of an elite few deluding themselves into thinking that they control much of anything. More on this in a future post. <br><br>Patz, granted, the details are impossible to gauge in advance. The broad picture is another matter. If you know how overshoot and dieoff work in other species, and you know how catabolic collapse has happened in other societies, you can make useful predictions about the general course of events -- just as people were able to predict the outcome of the housing bubble quite accurately several years in advance.

In many U.S. high schools, the smart kids skipped over Earth Science and went straight on to Bio or Chem. Even if they took a geo course in college, the Earth System perspective (focus on flows of energy and matter with intertwined feedbacks) that is so prominent in today's geoscience curricula was very uncommon when they were in college. Bio courses were likely little help, in that during the time that the baby boomers were in college, the Bio departments in many prestigious U.S. colleges had shifted heavily towards the study of cells and smaller, and away from the study of organisms and ecosystems.<br><br>Lacking an educational grounding in any kind of Earth Systems thinking, it is perhaps not so surprising that economists failed to notice that the human economy is embedded within the larger global ecosystem, and that therefore growth of any single entity or process is not sustainable indefinitely. <br><br>I blogged about this on "Earth &amp; Mind: The Blog" (http://serc.carleton.edu/earthandmind/posts/economists_wron.html) under "How Did Economists Get it So Wrong?"<br><br><a href=#c1987441584985464297 title="comment permalink">9/25/09, 1:39 AM</a><br><br>

It is meant to support JMG's empowering advice to have a good hard look at the history of economics, finance and monetary systems. <br><br>"The study of money, among all other fields of economics, is one in which complexity is used to disguise truth, not to reveal it.(p. 15) The process by which banks create money is so simple that the mind is repelled." (p. 29) John Kenneth Galbraith, Money, Whence it Came, Where it Went, 1975.<br><br>"There is something so consummately ridiculous in the idea of a nation's getting money by paying interest to itself upon its own stock, that the mind of every rational man naturally rejects it. It is something, really, little short of madness to suppose that a nation can increase its wealth, increase its means of paying others ... that it can do this by paying interest to itself! When time is taken to reflect, no rational man will attempt to maintain a proposition so shockingly absurd." British MP William Cobbett, Paper against Gold, p. 83, 1810.<br><br>Over a century later, an American would refer to this absurdity in these terms:<br>"Such a system assumes that you can borrow yourself out of debt." <br>Willis A. Overholser,A Short Review and Analysis of the History of Money in the United States, 1936.<br><br>"If all the bank loans were paid, no-one could have a bank deposit and there would not be a dollar of coin or currency in circulation. This is a staggering thought. We are completely dependent on the commercial banks. Someone has to borrow every dollar we have in circulation, cash or credit...We are absolutely without a permanent money system. When one gets a complete grasp of the picture, the tragic absurdity of our hopeless position is almost incredibel, but there it is ... It is the most important subject that intelligent persons can investigate and reflect upon.

It's a lot less comforting, and therefore harder, to recognize that collective decisions in which each of us has participated are the driving force behind our predicament, and that the "elite few" are simply those who have clawed their way to the top of an unsteady heap, and that the heap itself has internal dynamics they do not control and often cannot even influence. Everything I see leads me to think that this latter model is the more accurate one, and energy spent blaming our troubles on scapegoats might be better put elsewhere.<br><br>Kevin, yes, that's central. If you remember that a society that cannibalizes its own capital stock can take pressure off its dwindling resource base, and win itself a temporary reprieve from decline, you've got the core of the theory -- the stairstep process of decline that results when a complex society overshoots its resource base. <br><br>Kim, thanks for the link!

I'm glad to see that you take an interest in my probably offbeat and weird-sounding contributions to this excellent blog. Though I don't actually recall if my intention was to be humorous in the part that you mention, it was definitely intended to indicate that there's a certain (twisted) logic in the way things play out in economics, as elsewhere, when a perverted baseline "set of assumptions," as JMG would say, is allowed to establish the rules of the game.<br><br>What's surprising about the fox strutting around the henhouse like he owns the place? ... when he does own the place? The question then becomes: Why would anybody want to own such a place? To channel gains to themselves and friends, no doubt, but I think there's something else at work here. Those who appear to "run things," in fact don't! They're on a fast-spinning carrousel and can't get off. They do what they know how to do but their skills-set is sadly lacking in breadth and depth, no matter how impressive it is in their specialty area. So they continue putting splints on the patient's leg when he's suffering from coronary occlusion. And they'll tweak things around the edges and they'll pretend to have found the failsafe mechanism needed to guarantee this or that desired outcome ... But it will never come because "hacking at the branches," as opposed to "striking the root" (in Thoreau's famous distinction), can only result in the real problem getting swept under the carpet.<br><br>So, what's the "real problem?" I don't pretend to have it all figured out but I could add something to my previous post here, which seemed somehow incomplete to me. I think I was wrong to speak of "this other (ie economic) predicament." After mulling over JMG's latest one more time, I would rather say that most of the "real problems" we face, be they linked to climate change, energy and resource depletion, biodiversity loss or spiritual confusion, are all part of one and the same predicament: we don't know who we are and rarely have the courage to make an honest effort to find out. For example, deep acceptance of what it means to be part of Nature, not separate from it, has ramifications that are scarier than you'd think for many people. So we allow institutional symbol manipulators to tell us who we are and hope we'll get by with that ... until the next crisis. I'll leave the metaphysical tie-ins to a nimbler mind than my own in next week's Archdruid Report.<br><br>As for the French quotes, I somehow forgot to give the latest poet's name: Conon de Béthune, 13th C. Nor did I give the original text of the quote from Paul Valéry last week. It is: "La meilleure façon de réaliser ses rêves, c'est de se réveiller." It's always nice to be able to do some reading in a language other than one's own, maybe something to do with getting a different perspective.<br><br>Best,<br>Gav<br><br><a href=#c5331747129956814354 title="comment permalink">9/26/09, 7:06 AM</a><br><br>

A misreading on my part of your final paragraph.<br>A side-note. I like the references you give, with the following two reservations: I'm less dismissive of Freud - he's easy to criticize now that we've seen how his work on hysteria was biased, but what's bias? In his time, who had gone further in denouncing social indoctrination as a cause of cultural malaise? Yes, some of the ancient philosophies had - and in a much less science-based world - but with the progress-minded Industrial Revolution going full bore, he was nevertheless prescient in more than one book: The 5 Lessons, Psychopathology of Everyday Life, The Future of an Illusion, Metapsychology, not to mention his work on dreams.<br><br>The second reservation concerns the notion of "apatheia." Not that I'm against it, per se, nor do I contest the idea that is has applications today. It's just that presenting it as a cure-all in downturns seem a bit excessive. Using it to turn off disturbances when the psyche really needs to seems justified; using it as a Weltanschauung in order to tune out entirely may be less helpful.

One is that the political system bends like a reed in the wind. It gives just enough and at the appropriate time to shed forces which would otherwise break it. The other is that the dominant American paradigm of what the US stands for and what it does in the world is an effective agent of control. The American Dream myth plays into this in a big way.<br><br>Before economics adheres to scientific rigor, it needs to do its part in supporting the myth which perpetuates this system. That is not to say that where you see economists deviate from logic, they are putting in effort directed by some moonlit cabal towards this goal. But it does need to tithe to certain dogmas such as the system still being capitalist despite major structural changes in the mid 20th century, that it is impartial, ignoring data showing very little class mobility and the one you mention where it is scientific and adheres to natural law despite the illogic and man made design.<br><br>If economics failed to do this and instead devoted itself to accurately describing the true system of wealth distribution, it would risk exposing the man behind the curtain and remove one of the pillars of the American Dream myth. This could potentially expose the system to changes earlier than necessary.<br><br>Some individuals have done just that, whether in the political, economic or social spheres, but these have usually been easily ignored since their messages stray beyond the working paradigm.<br><br><a href=#c2540896478131793899 title="comment permalink">9/26/09, 9:10 PM</a><br><br>

I have some familiarity with writings on REBT and CBT, no direct experience but they seem to provide ways of dealing with the ravages of our way of life that have demonstrated efficacy. <br><br>My reference to misrepresentation below in another post in fact concerned what I had too hastily sent off to you. Of your views firstly, for reasons already mentioned and of mine, since I am really no fan of psychoanalysis of any stripe. Given a straight-up choice, Jung or Freud, I'd have to go with the former but, frankly, I don't want to be on either one's couch. Fact is, one of my neighbors is a Freudian psychoanalyst and occasionally we chat. I don't pull any punches with him but he has convinced me that, at least sometimes, he does get some positive results. Hard to say what's going to work best when, where and with whom.<br><br>As for apatheia, I realize how words get terribly distorted over time and can even come to mean something close to the opposite of their original meaning. I think I had in mind the Christian Greek use of the word, which I don't much care for (more or less "blind obedience"). <br><br>Still, if we, as a society, started addressing problems before they become problems,instead of eternally treating symptoms of something deeper, we might be able to reduce the number of therapies on offer by eliminating part of the need for them. <br><br>I intend to propose another thought or two on the subject tomorrow in a little more detail if I can get my head around it.<br><br><a href=#c8908020917903037109 title="comment permalink">9/27/09, 1:27 PM</a><br><br>

JMG mentions that <i>being wrong is much more lucrative than being right</i> for economists, and his example implies a bottom-up pressure of investor masses eager for good news. Average investors indeed are good only in following each other or talking head gurus - but that does not stand in the way of putting concerned gurus on TV.<br><br>The evolution of economics of the last 3-4 decades, especially the rise of the Chicago school "free market" monetarism at the depressing expense of alternatives, is not a typical academic development. Before the 1970s, Milton Friedman and the Chicago school were far from a "mainstream science" status. But their economics started to attract very good funding (perhaps because it offered a convenient justification of wilder economic order?!). Their growth of influence was very well organized, especially internationally (starting from Chile) and politically (see Reagan, Thatcher). The selective bias was well supported by a row of ideological think thanks, such as American Enterprise Institute, Cato Institute, Club For Growth, Heritage Foundation. That gives quite a different impulse for <i>being wrong more lucratively</i>. <br><br>By the 1980s, the Chicago school economics became virtually the only recipe for third world and post-socialist economies and economists. The IMF and the World Bank became enforcers of the Washington consensus, pushing for one-sided economic reforms and globalization everywhere.<br><br>And then we have the "Nobel commemorative" prize, indeed not particularly bounded to award <i>"greatest benefit for <b>mankind</b>"</i>.

It seems we're not quick learners. The Romans found out about the downside of debasing your currency over extended periods of time; John Law nearly destroyed the whole French economy in the early 18th C with his truly "royal" Ponzi scheme etc.<br><br>Seeking an opinion here, this idea has occurred to me regarding our more modern mess: could the granting of the status of personhood to corporations in 1886 (which I regard as sheer folly) have worked as a sort of (unintended) seed legislation for the later expansion of lobbies and eventual control by those lobbies of some of our vital government processes?

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c7839698970678780934></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/15304455723410991848 rel=nofollow>J Gav</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>JMG<br><br>I can't help asking myself what these "core factors" you refer to might be. To be honest, related questions have nagged me off and on for some time now but I've never been able to put anything together to my satisfaction to explain the 'core' issues.<br><br>At present, my attempt to do so takes the notion of 'personhood' as a pivotal factor. The reasoning is simple, no doubt too simple, and is based on a question: What chokepoint must humans pass through to move as smoothly as possible from childhood to adulthood with a view to becoming positively-contributing members of a civil order? Would this not also be a sort of make-or-break point for social, political and economic coherence?<br><br>If it is fair to say that societies in a state of constant, protracted (pre-collapse) flux tend to lose their coherence in the shuffle du jour, depending on whatever ideology is dominant, the precise nature of that which is lost remains to be determined. Since, causally speaking, this in turn manifests in social disharmony such as increased mental illness, criminality, loss of a sense of self and community and so on, it must be considered a matter of some importance.<br><br>What exactly are we neglecting that allows such gaping holes in our ability to construct collectively? How is it that we create 'identities' so fragile that they cling desperately to the latest fashion, gadget, pop-star or TV series in their quest for meaning?<br><br>To begin a tentative answer to these questions, I'll posit this backdrop, not new, but adapted to suit my purposes: 3 spheres - the material, ie the down-to-earth aspects of human experience; the ethereal or supernal, wa-a-ay up there ; and a transitional or intermediate place meeant to serve as facilitator, navigator or bridge between the first two spheres mentioned.<br><br>Now, here comes the "leap." At some point, whether they realize it or not, humans generally need assistance in dealing with the intimidating uncertainties which accompany notions like 'infinity,' the 'meaning of life' ... or death. The stuff of the third sphere. Alone, an individual human can easily lose her way trying to negotiate the maze of possibilities, always ripe for speculation. Hence the need for mediation, which can take many forms. Ours has pretty much been reduced to an administrative, accounting, star-system cum self-help guide operation. However, if shamanic and druidic societies, for example, have always had initiations and ceremonies to mark key moments in the life of an individual or community, it isn't because they think it's fun but because they serve a vital purpose.<br><br>With no meaningful (ie community-legitimized) mediation, the narcissistic tendencies of the immature human risk hypertrophy while, conversely, social skills atrophy, leading to all manner of conflict and misunderstanding. Granted, this sort of Initiation with a capital 'I' is often painful, psychologically and sometimes physically depending on the culture, but a fully-integrated person emerges from it, one for whom understanding the importance of maintaining balance among the 3 spheres has become second nature. Once this is achieved, cooperative work toward common goals becomes "less problematic," as you say. This can not be accomplished with truncated individuals, shorn of those tools that a healthy society provides its citizens in order to help them make sense of the world. Instead, that sort of society sends them up Competition Creek without a paddle. <br><br>Social glue! Without it, the first severe test that comes along can send personhood flying to pieces like a shattered mirror and taking yet another chunk of community along with it. To be sure, as substitutes for initiation, we put out a steady stream of new ways to get over this or that hump in life, but there's no longer anything to initiate people into! There's no 'there' there.<br><br>Could it be that one reason for our predicament lies in our failure to ensure adequate initiation and rites of passage for our youth and citizens in genere? There must be an interface with metaphysics here somewhere.<br><br><a href=#c7839698970678780934 title="comment permalink">9/28/09, 1:01 PM</a><br><br>

But I think you do! Otherwise, you wouldn't have written this last week: "It's about exiting the common value network that holds real meaning in check." <br><br>If you wish to exit a defective "common value network," you must have some idea of what you would like to see take its place. And I doubt that you intend to substitute an "every man for himself and the devil take the hindmost" mentality as a remedy. <br><br>So, unless you believe that a one-by-one conversion to something saner (over how many years?) will cut the mustard, you can only be talking about something social,i.e.involving 'society.'<br><br>I'm not convinced that's off-topic but to be sure I'll add this: Early 20th C Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter is the one who coined the term "creative destruction," later contorted into the Chicago Boys' romp. Today we've got the destruction part down pat but don't seem to have come up with a great deal in the way of creativity, other than to perpetuate an unsustainable system. All alone in one's corner, creativity is no doubt still possible but what would it mean?<br><br><a href=#c7629133053847329070 title="comment permalink">9/29/09, 1:24 PM</a><br><br>

My original comment about 'exiting the groupmind' was not my answer to the question of what to do about peak oil, but to the question of how to 'really live', which was the topic back then -- with <b>JMG</b>'s response to <b>Tony</b> about wanting to 'really live' in these new times. If you want to 'really live' or have a life filled with meaning, at this or any time, go ahead -- you will have to 'exit the groupmind that holds real meaning in check' in order to do it, is all I was saying, and you can do that at <i>any</i> time, decline or no decline, is what <b>JMG</b> was saying.<br><br>I did also mention that times like these may inspire more people to attempt real work on themselves, and I think that's true -- but I'm not looking to that to prevent a 'hard landing'! Plenty more people will respond to these times in ways that improve survival odds and make life more bearable, and if enough gets done, the landing could be softened up quite a deal still.<br><br>This has nothing to do with 'really living' though, necessarily, let alone with the kinds of utopia that are being thought about idealistically and romantically in so many quarters. If you want to 'really live' -- live a life filled with meaning and be what a human being can be, that's something different from dealing with peak oil! The latter is just about getting to live at all and survive with maybe a little dignity and some valuable stuff brought along (culturally not materially valuable I hasten to add), but that's not 'really living' any more than the fag-end of the industrial age with its TV and malls is 'really living'. 'Really living' comes from somewhere else altogether! :)<br><br><a href=#c6615399768610872020 title="comment permalink">10/2/09, 4:52 AM</a><br><br>
