Last week's post on <i>The Archdruid Report</i> got rather more than the usual number of responses. Most of the comment – no surprises there – focused on my suggestion that the hopes for a better future retailed so freely by all sides in today’s cultural conversations face certain disappointment. At first glance, this may not seem like a controversial statement; one of the crucial facts about the future, after all, is that the fossil fuels that prop up current lifestyles across the industrial world, and provide the basis for survival for hundreds of millions in the Third World, are depleting rapidly with no adequate replacements in sight.<br><br>That hard fact pretty much guarantees a future in which poverty, hunger, warfare, and early death will be vastly more common than their opposites, and in which a great many of the comforts and opportunities we now take for granted will no longer be available. That, in turn, would certainly seem to define the future ahead of us as worse than the present, in ways sweeping enough that any benefits to be gained from the changes in store could be considered consolation prizes at best. Still, so straightforward an assessment of our prospects is profoundly unwelcome in many circles these days.<br><br>The difficulty here is that faith in the prospect of a better future has been so deeply ingrained in all of us that trying to argue against it is a bit like trying to tell a medieval peasant that heaven with all its saints and angels isn’t there any more. The hope that tomorrow will be, or can be, or at the very least ought to be better than today is hardwired into the collective imagination of the modern world. Behind that faith lies the immense example of three hundred years of industrial expansion, which cashed in the cheaply accessible fraction of the Earth’s fossil fuel reserves for a brief interval of abundance so extreme that garbage collectors in today’s America have access to things that emperors could not get before the industrial revolution dawned.<br><br>That age of extravagance has profoundly reshaped – in terms of the realities of human life before and after our age, a better word might be “distorted” – the way people nowadays think about very nearly anything you care to name. In particular, it has blinded us to the ecological realities that provide the fundamental context to our lives. It’s made nearly all of us think, for example, that unlimited exponential growth is possible, normal, and good, and so even as the disastrous consequences of unlimited exponential growth slam into our society one after another like waves hitting a sand castle, the vast majority of people nowadays still build their visions of the future on the fantasy that problems caused by growth can be solved by still more growth.<br><br>The distorted thinking we have inherited from three centuries of unsustainable growth crops up in full force even among many of those who think they’re reacting against it. Activists at every point on the political spectrum have waxed rhetorical for generations about the horrors the future has in store, to be sure, but they always offer a way out – the adoption of whatever agenda they happen to be promoting – and it leads straight to a bright new tomorrow, in which the hard limits of the present somehow no longer seem to apply. (Take away the trope of “the only way to rescue a better future from the jaws of imminent disaster” from today’s activist rhetoric, for that matter, and in most cases there’s very little left.)<br><br>Still, the bright new tomorrow we’ve all been promised is not going to arrive. This is the bad news brought to us by the unfolding collision between industrial society and the unyielding limits of the planetary biosphere. Peak oil, global warming, and all the other crises gathering around the world are all manifestations of a single root cause: the impossibility of infinite growth on a finite planet. They are warning signals telling us that we have gone into full-blown overshoot – the state, familiar to ecologists, in which a species outruns the resource base that supports it – and they tell us also that growth is not merely going to stop; it’s going to reverse, and that reversal will continue until our population, resource use, and waste production drop to levels that can be sustained over the long term by a damaged planetary ecosystem. <br><br>That bitter outcome might have been prevented if we had collectively taken decisive action before we went into overshoot. We did not do so, and at this point the window of opportunity is firmly shut. Nearly all the proposals currently being floated to deal with the symptoms of our planetary overshoot assume, tacitly or otherwise, that this is not the case and we still have as much time as we need. Such proposals are wasted breath, and if any of them are enacted – and some of them very likely will be enacted, once today’s complacency gives way to tomorrow’s stark panic – the resources poured into them will be wasted as well. <br><br>This is one of the reasons it seems crucial to me to keep coming back to the hard facts of our predicament: our limited resources and even more limited time need to be directed toward projects that might actually do some good. Still, there’s another side to this repeated insistence on an unwelcome reality, and the best way to explore that is to glance back at one of the responses to last week’s post.<br><br>The comment in question came from a reader who signed himself “Tony.” I trust he won’t feel unduly picked on, as I’ve chosen his response as a thoughtful and eloquent expression of a common feeling that many readers of mine, and countless others as well, have expressed in their own ways. While acknowledging the ghastly human toll that will be inflicted by the ending of the industrial age, he argues that life in the modern world, while materially prosperous, is empty and meaningless, and hopes that life after industrialism will be more fulfilling. He comments: <br><br><i>My life is EASY now, but I do not LIKE it. My body may have ease, but not my soul. I also find no soul’s ease in the prospects for many, say, who need modern health care to live. I nonetheless find excitement in the thought that current power structures may soon crumble, finally giving those like myself, and others in my generation, a chance to really live.</i><br><br>Any of my readers who have been in contact with the peak oil scene, or any of the other movements that have predicted the decline and fall of our present civilization, will have heard these same feelings expressed many times. Some of my readers may have had such feelings themselves. The idea that a future of material deprivation and suffering may nonetheless be better in some psychological or spiritual sense echoes tropes deeply rooted in the narratives of our culture. Who among us hasn’t daydreamed about fleeing from the complexities and moral compromises of modern existence to some simpler and more strenuous life where, at least in our imaginations, the sources of life and meaning are closer?<br><br>It’s a very old fantasy. The Roman poet Horace, in his Second Epode, put the same sentiments in the mouth of a moneylender, who imagined himself living the simple life of a poor farmer off in the Italian hill country, then turned from such daydreams back to the work of managing his investments. No doubt there were plenty of poor farmers in Horace’s time whose daydreams fixated instead on the high life of a wealthy moneylender in Rome.<br><br>Still, there’s a crucial difference. Neither Alfius the moneylender nor the poor farmers of the Italian hinterlands, as far as we know, ever harnessed their daydreams of a better life to fantasies of global catastrophe. Nowadays, by contrast, a great many people do exactly that. From fundamentalist Christians who pin their hopes on the Rapture – “He’s tooting, and I’m scooting,” to quote a popular bumper sticker – straight through to the current crop of utopian true believers who insist that the implosion of the industrial world will be followed by the inevitable triumph of whatever ideology they favor, a great many people nowadays pin their hopes of a better life onto whatever convenient cataclysm comes to mind. Tony’s hope that the fall of current power structures will allow him “a chance to really live” is simply another variation on this theme.<br><br>The irony here would be worth savoring if it weren’t so potentially explosive. I’m normally unsympathetic to claims that our civilization is a unique case, but in this context it may just have accomplished something that no other society in all of history can match. Certainly I can’t think of another case in which people faced with the tolerably common human experience of a less than fulfilling life have had so few inner resources to hand, and so little knowledge of past thought about the same problem, that the only option a great many of them seem to be able to find is to sit around and wait for the world to end. <br><br>I try to wear my archdruid’s hat lightly in discussions in this blog, but it’s hard to think of any way to speak to this situation that doesn’t wade fairly deep into the waters of philosophy, not to mention spirituality. The fact that a life lived in material comfort can be unsatisfying does not mean that the comfort is what makes it unsatisfying. Life can be every bit as barren of meaning to someone who is starving to death in a burned-out basement, or scratching out a bare living from a few acres of mud and manure around a squalid hovel. The choices we make in response to our surroundings affect our relationship to the sources of meaning far more powerfully than the surroundings themselves, and those choices depend on the quality and content of our inner lives, not on outer factors. None of this ought to be news to anyone; it can be found in every tradition of human wisdom and spiritual teaching from the dawn of history right up to the present, and it remains as valid today as it ever was.<br><br>If Tony and his countless equivalents want “a chance to really live,” in other words, nothing is holding them back. If they feel their present comforts are obstacles to a better life, nothing prevents them from getting rid of those comforts. If they feel that danger and deprivation would make life more real for them, those can also be had easily enough by those who actually want them. Of course that’s the rub. Alfius could have gotten out of the moneylending business, donated his wealth to charity, moved to a farm and made his rural fantasy real, but of course he didn’t actually want to do that; he simply wanted to daydream about it. I admit to a strong suspicion that the same is true of Tony and his peers.<br><br>Alfius’ daydreams, mind you, were relatively harmless. I am not sure the same thing can be said of the fantasy of redemption through catastrophe that underlies Tony’s comments and the feelings of a great many other people just now. As industrial civilization begins to come apart around us in the decades ahead, the mismatch between that fantasy and the bitter realities of life in a dying civilization will stand out in increasingly stark colors, but in the meantime those who indulge in daydreams of destruction are a good deal less likely to take the practical, positive steps that could make the time of troubles ahead of us less harrowing than it could be. <br><br>Thus I think it’s crucial to come back to the hard fact that we are not heading toward a happier future in any sense that matters. We are moving into a troubled, difficult, dangerous age in which most of us stand to lose a great many of the things that matter to us. Those troubles may encourage some of us to pursue a relationship with the sources of meaning in our lives, granted, but they are at least as likely to keep others too busy scrambling for survival or grieving over their losses to find time for that challenging process. When we project our fantasies of a better life onto the inkblot patterns of catastrophe, then, we’re kidding ourselves, and the sooner we grasp that – the sooner we come to terms with the bleak predicament facing us, and turn our attention to figuring out what might still be saved and then trying to save it – the more likely we are to make a positive difference in a bitter time.

C.F. John Mayer's song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPOBMzMTP4U" rel=nofollow>"Waiting On The World To Change."</a> To a great extent this is true.<br><br>While times of breakdown are times of hardship, they are also times of great possibility. Whatever else happens, the game will change, and the current winners will no longer be manipulating the game. And, while most will lose, some new faces will be among the winners. The status quo will be drastically and permanently changed.<br><br>I've been on both sides of this equation. Personally I'm looking forward to getting laid off in a few weeks. There is no official announcement, but the writing is on the wall. I can get back to farming and if I never have the opportunity to administer servers again, I could live with that. I've done it before. And despite the poverty, I genuinely enjoyed my life a lot more when I was farming.<br><br><a href=#c1422074597375970462 title="comment permalink">9/16/09, 8:42 PM</a><br><br>

It's not simply that many are failing to make a choice, but that ability to choose is facing constant bombardment. There also has never been an age in which we were so constantly persuaded from a vast variety of directions as to the meaning of our life than what the current powers are doing now. It leaves a person left with a feeling of helplessnes even when and after having searched desperately for a philosophical/spiritual direction in life. So naturally, the blame card is brought in, and as always, it is easier to blame someone else. It's easy to blame these current powers.<br><br><a href=#c5567993774852556537 title="comment permalink">9/16/09, 9:40 PM</a><br><br>

Past versions of What You Can Do have been mostly checklists, and I thought this time I'd try to provide a model, a process that each individual can tailor to her or his own capacities, abilities and passions. It's illustrated above, and it's fairly ambitious, but I think it makes sense.

It also draws on the work of Richard Moss, Otto Scharmer, and my book Finding the Sweet Spot.<br><br>Here's a walk through of the process, which to some extent I've applied in my own life.

One example in my view would be the near impossibility of stopping the plunder of the many community gardens that have popped up around the world through the permaculture movement, despite the tender and caring attitudes of their caretakers.

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c1220046863668618772></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/08174222682878344684 rel=nofollow>Karim</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Dear JMG,<br><br>As usual a fascinating piece. Alas, you are correct in pointing out that the future will probably be materially much harsher than what the present is for most people, especially in rich countries. Indeed, one can argue that our present modern world, which now could be called the Old World is dying and that the New World to come is not yet born, hence the transition will be difficult but NOT impossible. <br><br>You are also correct that the Myth of Continual Progress veils and clouds the understanding of the vast majority who fully expect a technological marvel to make up for the depletion of energy resources. <br><br>However, there is a dimension in the discourse of Tony that perhaps needs more analysis. For instance when he says "My life is EASY now, but I do not LIKE it. My body may have ease, but not my soul", it appears to me that Tony is also saying that the modern world has destroyed to a large part any meaning and purpose to life that people need and that the demise of the modern world will somehow recreate meaning and purpose for us. Hence the yearning for the collapse of the modern world. <br><br>If that is so, it is clear that not only do we need to address the practicalities of material survival like food, water, energy, shelter and health, but we also need to address the need to recreate a sense of meaning and purpose that will provide hope and guidance for all. It is important to acknowledge the vital necessity of re-creating meaning and purpose because from them do we derive, to a large part, our strengths, motivations and willpower to face the inevitable difficulties of a post peak oil world.<br><br>Already the task to ensure material and cultural survival is truly immense, but in addition to the above we need to recreate meaning and purpose. And that can only be done through a deeper understanding of human spirituality. Alas, this dimension is rarely addressed in peak oil discussions. <br><br>I do apologise for the length of my response. <br><br>Karim<br><br><a href=#c1220046863668618772 title="comment permalink">9/17/09, 12:30 AM</a><br><br>

I live in a supine society where people are nostalgic about the Dunkirk spirit! Or crofting. I am convinced as you are, that we have reached the point of no return on the growth front.<br>However, I also live in a society where we turned around smogs that were killing thousands years ago, and revived polluted rivers, so I'm not entirely convinced that a complete meltdown is a done deal. <br><br>I think it is better psychology to point out the satisfaction in developing inner resources, not material palliatives, in building community rather than fencing yourself in for fear of other people pinching your stuff, in stressing the value of what we cherish rather than the vulnerability of what we want. I have the benefit of a religious vocabulary to do this, but it works for people of all faiths and philosophies - except the ones who are using God as a security blanket.<br><br><a href=#c762302655834011327 title="comment permalink">9/17/09, 2:00 AM</a><br><br>

Anybody who has ever been poor or lived close to poor populations and has studied crime and mental illness statistics can see that poverty doesn't exactly improve a person's spiritual state or bring personal fulfillment, but is more likely to produce opposite results. Anyone who doubts that ought to just quit his well-paid job and move into an SRO hotel in a major city and make his living begging on the streets, or try living "off the land" in a rural shanty without electricity and running water for a few months to see what spiritual peace and a sense of well-being will resent.<br><br>I read these people on the comment threads of Kunstler's blog, among others, and feel great fear to think that we have such a large number of people who hate humanity and hate civilization and all its achievements and benefits. These people will not be helpful to themselves or the rest of us as we struggle to remain human and to preserve as much of our life-giving culture as possible in the years of decline, to say the least. <br><br>We could end up regressing to the filth, brutality, and superstition of the past quickly enough without these people. But I get the feeling that there are legions of them hiding out there and that they will hasten the process greatly. Every time I read a comment from one these people, and, sadly, from some of our major pundits like Kunstler, that speaks of how wonderful it will be when all us peasants out here are forced out of our cars and comfortable homes, and are forced to work in the fields instead of enjoying some admittedly mindless leisure pursuit, I feel terror, and tremendous anger at the brainless Rousseaian mindset that would discard every beautiful, life-giving thing that our best minds have given us over thousands of years, just to see the fellow humans they so despise suffer and die in the ruins, or end up eking out their lives as rural slaves. <br><br>Oftentimes I wonder if it wouldn't be better for someone like me just to die with the civilization that has given me not only incredible material comfort and amenity, but also mental stimulation and access to knowledge that would not have been possible 150 years ago.

I suppose there will be more of this, when people eventually get the gist of what the future has in store.

Clearly democracy does not work - the only votes that count have $$$ attached to them, at all levels of government. People feel entirely helpless to do anything - they're trapped by govt, by the moneylenders, by their community dysfunctions. Yet who wants a dictator? That pretty much only leaves anarchy as a possibility for real change - and the only way to get that is through a collapse of some sort. If the Tonys of this world felt anything they could DO would make a real difference, they might try it. But most people can't even imagine trying, much less succeeding. They see what happens to people who try and buck the system, and it isn't pretty. So the options seem to be: suffer alone and accomplish nothing, everybody suffers and a new age is born. The math doesn't look quite as hopeless with option #2. Option #1 is suicide for nothing.<br><br><a href=#c7543469496341327206 title="comment permalink">9/17/09, 6:37 AM</a><br><br>

Just as modern industrialism has given us many wonderful things in addition to many awful things, like horrible environmental toxins and Britney Spears, the post-collapse future will be both good and bad. I'd give better than even odds that it will be more bad than good for most people, and there's always, as a friend recently pointed out, the possibility we could still nuke ourselves to death. So there's that.<br><br>JMG - I agree with you in at least one way: I could always change my life now. Believe me, I've been contemplating it. I'm an urban planner, recently out of graduate school (in my 20s). I chose that career path after getting a bachelor's in the sciences because I wanted to help "save the world". I saw humans as the main reason the Earth was under such stress, but rather than whine and complain about it, or march in endless rallies waving signs in the air, I thought I'd be proactive, seriously study "better ways" and learn the methods of implementing that knowledge in the real word. Problem was and is, so few people realize how imminently disaster threatens - and planning is an <i>incremental</i> business. Too incremental to avert collapse, but no, not worthless. Just, maybe, not for me. So I'm thinking about that.<br><br>I took some poetic license when I spoke of having an easy life that I don't like. Several people seemed to like that line! My wife and I live off my pittance of a wage - less than $30k per year, after taxes. My wife is taking courses full-time to be a teacher. However, we aren't excessive and still manage to save money. I actually just loaned a friend a couple thousand dollars to get him through hard times. What's money? If I accept it'll soon be worthless (conventionally as well as spiritually), I may as well spend it on things that matter - like relationships.<br><br><br><i>...if JMG approves, I've split this comment into two parts, because I'm just over the space limit! ...</i><br><br><a href=#c7925182421454058193 title="comment permalink">9/17/09, 7:39 AM</a><br><br>

I too find much about our modern life unfulfilling, and the constant pressure to conform to a homogeneous corporate norm make it difficult to see other paths, but there is no reason one cannot begin living right now. Why must one wait? You can turn off the TV anytime, and you can begin to examine the things you've been told at anytime too. It's good to think differently, but the real step is to try to live differently. The challenges of raising, educating, and providing for my children keep me tied to the society at large - but those ties are getting pretty lose these days. <br><br>There is nothing to be ashamed of in taking a different path, but the first steps can be difficult, and it will take a very long time to self-deprogram - I know it will take me lifetime. But at this point, I thoroughly enjoy the fact that the world I see is not the same as what the people all around me see, even if I am often very sad at what has been revealed.<br><br><a href=#c2196792431536323199 title="comment permalink">9/17/09, 7:40 AM</a><br><br>

In part I want to see things get worse enough, and forced change to start to happen, because it then will legitimize the choices many of us are trying to take. Right now, with no obvious evidence of collapse around us that everyday people will see, I still feel like a lunatic to believe what I do about what is coming. To bring it closer to home, with two kids in college and one who just graduated, it is hard to make decisions that might bring immediate hardships to them and kill their dreams when the evidence around them still suggests otherwise. It will be a relief to have enough change happening once it does occur so one does not feel questioned about contrary decisions anymore. That in itself much suggest a "rosier" future.<br><br>Also, how many face satisfaction about today's world probably stems with how they are employed, those that are still employed. I don't know what Tony and others do to earn a living, but there are many jobs that too their occupants do feel like meaningless jobs, or ones that lack true satisfaction in doing good. Those lucky to have a job that provides them with satisfaction probably have a different viewpoint than one for which the goal of the job is only to put food on the table. Yet who wants to turn down even having a job right now without a backup, even if the even goal is being better prepared for tomorrow?<br><br><a href=#c383154163779359601 title="comment permalink">9/17/09, 7:41 AM</a><br><br>

I don't doubt, JMG, that you're right, that there are many who, for their own reasons, take glee in the prospects of a collapse. Many who might even try to hurry it along. Nevertheless, when I say I look forward to it, I should say I accept it as inevitable. I'm not a psychologist and am not as familiar as some with Kubler-Ross's Five Stages of Grief, but I think I get the concept. Personally, I vacillate between anger, depression, and acceptance. Maybe it would be more accurate to say I experience each simultaneously, but for different facets of the situation. Anger at those that got us here (I'm young, I can do that). Depression thinking about my mother, who takes a daily regimen of pills to keep herself alive. Acceptance that, no matter how I may feel about what's happening, it <i>will happen anyway.</i> From acceptance, I act. In my role as a planner I try to build resilience where I can in my little community. In my role as a citizen in a democracy I try to build awareness of these issues to catalyze action. In my role as a husband, I talk to my wife and we both set about preparing how we can for ourselves. In my role as a friend, I plan with friends for an uncertain future, and set about creating an intentional community.<br><br>I'm not a druid, but I've studied the martial arts. In my dojo, we've spoken of the necessity to have "no mind" in combat and in life (there are parallels to this in many of the world's religious traditions). <b>Attachment to outcomes does not lead to better outcomes.</b> To use an outdated metaphor which probably will inspire ridicule, a samurai in combat does not care if he dies, and that is how he survives.<br><br>A couple of other small points before I cease my tresspass on everyone's viewing space. I've lived in poor communities. I spent time in northern South Africa, just south of Zimbabwe. I've seen refugees from the strife there. I remember when the headlines read "No Bread in Zimbabwe." Zimbabwe used to be a breadbasket - now basketcase. I worked as a project manager in a very rural community in SA, 95% unemployment. Our project focused on capacity-building ("teach a man to fish" instead of "giving him a fish"). I've seen poverty. I know that it is no picnic. That didn't stop the people from smiling and laughing. But apparently reading blogs on the internet does?<br><br>I'll leave it there. I certainly failed in my attempt at brevity!<br><br><a href=#c1466368028002147190 title="comment permalink">9/17/09, 7:41 AM</a><br><br>

If it's really an issue.<br>You are completely correct about the fact that those who believe that too much comfort and ease are bad for the soul could simply give it up and go live in the woods or something. <br>Some people have done this very successfully, such as the wonderful writer and artist Harlan Hubbard. He really did it for years, whereas Thoreau did a really small-scale experiment, but was mainly interested in the poetic and philosophical aspects of a simple life.<br><br>I would never accuse you of missing something, because you've no doubt thought of it already or would have a ready rejoinder. I would like to propose, however, that the spiritual malaise and disorders of our age of abundance are very real, and that the majority of suffers, like Tony, cannot find a way out.<br><br>Telling them that they could simply choose to give up their comforts and go for it is similar to the advice of rich people to the poor, when they tell them to pick themselves up by their own bootstraps. Unfortunately, those suffering from spiritual poverty lack the skills and resources necessary to easily find the path to meaning, just as the real poor lack many of the skills, habits, and resources needed to make money and starts careers or businesses.<br><br>While you are correct in your assessment of the dangers of the attitudes that Tony expresses, you might have more sympathy for the very real spiritual crisis of our age. You are part of a spiritual tradition, so you know how important such a grounding is in dealing with life in both abundant and materially poor cultures. ]<br>Rich people commit suicide... dirt poor people often find life extremely meaningful and worth living. How can we explain this except by resort to the inner, spiritual resources of the person and culture.<br><br>I would posit that our culture, for many over-determined reasons, has monetized and undermined so much of what makes life meaningful, that I have great sympathy for those who "yearn" for collapse. <br>I agree with you, however, in the need to resist this easy way out, and to do the hard work of finding meaning in whatever life one is currently leading, as well as preparing ourselves, families, and communities for the hardships coming.<br>I disagree with the North Coast commenter about Kunstler: he may push the envelope, and he seems to enjoy the schadenfreude of what's coming a bit, but it is simply reality that more people will have to work the land. So-called "Rousseau", furthermore, don't hate humanity. They have a different vision of the nature of humanity, and a different idea of what really makes a society happy based on that reading of human nature. Who is right, Rousseau or (variously, Hobbes, Locke, Darwin, the Pope, etc.)? That is really a religious dispute. <br>We can all agree that those who find meaning and even joy in the work and struggles ahead will be at a great advantage over those who don't.<br><br><a href=#c4976773345296894404 title="comment permalink">9/17/09, 7:58 AM</a><br><br>

Take away a man’s daydreams, though….  . <br>My ego (or whatever one would like to call that portion of the human consciousness that takes care of our bodies and reminds us of our own self-interest constantly) does not want to see a collapse of industrial society. I’m relatively young at 25, and so the majority of my life (should I have the strength, luck, and skills necessary to live that long) is sure to be wrought with tough challenges and increasing physical discomfort. I don’t yearn for this, and I don’t daydream about utopian peasant communities with perfect cooperation allowing hours of free time bursting forth immediately after the excrement has passed through the fan. <br>What I do daydream about is natural equilibrium. I’ve developed a personal spirituality by observing that I am made up of the same matter and energies that also make up the rest of the universe and, more closely, the rest of life on this planet. I believe that as “intelligent” beings, our main purpose in living should be to love – broadly defined as taking care of all life, and nourishing and maintaining the cycles of matter and energy that allow life to function on our planet for as long as it can. Sure, it is possible to pursue this life in today’s industrial society – but only within the larger context of a destructive socio-economic paradigm. Even if I were to move to any place on earth and live in absolute poverty, while this may help my feelings of guilt, it would do nothing to stop the destruction of life by the rest of my species. Thus, the part of my consciousness which encompasses a wider view of reality wholly embraces industrial collapse as a beautiful act of the energies of the Cosmos at work – reigning in a human species that has thrown so many natural systems and cycles out of whack, and moving things back toward equilibrium. <br>It seems to me that one’s feelings toward industrial collapse are based on the spirituality that one creates for oneself. I don’t know if this is where Tony was coming from – but with my philosophy grounded in the belief that ALL life on earth is sacred and important, I can look forward to the worst-case prospect of years of physical discomfort, toil, and suffering for myself and still know joy because a culture that destroys life is ending, and be hopeful that one which is more mindful of all life can emerge. Our coming challenges are a necessary dot in an awesome, dynamic universe. It is reasonable to take away hope of a comfortable, easy, egalitarian existence, but even if I’m starving to death because of severe food shortages and wacky weather – I will recognize the omnipotence, beauty, and goodness in the natural laws of the universe, and my true essence will be joyful. Bring on the equilibrium!<br><br><a href=#c7758759636214265120 title="comment permalink">9/17/09, 8:23 AM</a><br><br>

An eloquent and crystal clear post. Your genius, your grasp of the issues, and the way you do not allow yourself to be emotionally or intellectually knocked off balance (by so many approaching jousters) astounds me.<br><br>For my part, I think what the Tonys really want is a sense of community. I think we who identify with Tony have woken up to discover we live in a mass society. The “meaning” that we seek includes not only material temperance and personal spirituality, but also a sense of community. And community is trickier because we can’t re-create it on our own. (Let me tell you, it’s not easy to convince people that local is imperative. I’ve gotten in screaming matches with family members when I suggest not driving a car!)<br><br>Feeling the frustration of being unable to create a local community within mass society, I think many Tonys really hope for a collapse of mass society, which they may mistakenly lump with industrial civilization. Yes, some may hope to get rid of the vast misallocated suburban infrastructure, but even these (I don’t think) hope for the collapse of industrial civilization.<br><br>I personally am very sensitive to the idea of what constitutes a “true” local community. I of course have my own opinions on this, and I share your skepticism of the cohesion of “transition towns.” But nevertheless, I think one critical institution that will have to be rebuilt in the coming years is our local communities. I think many people see this as a silver lining.<br><br><a href=#c987046681615223470 title="comment permalink">9/17/09, 8:36 AM</a><br><br>

First: we may have a future with far less energy and material available to us, but there may also still be much more than was available to humans three or four hundred years ago. We consume all we do because it's cheap - that will not last. Once prices change (economically and ecologically), systems will change.<br><br>A comparison: read "your brain is (almost)perfect" - Montague outlines how the human mind evolved to exploit limited energy. He contrasts the brain to a microprocessor - vast energy consumption and burning to touch, because energy is cheap for us. The brain runs on less than a lightbulb's worth, and is merely warm, despite carrying out vastly more complex tasks. The same applies to any complex system: this may yet mean a low-energy future is a dystopian one, but *cost* (again, not just economic but ecological) will force our systems to adapt in ways we can't imagine now.<br><br>Second, have you watched Nathan Lewis cost a whole range of various energy future possibilities? http://nsl.caltech.edu/energy.html I can't imagine any better outline, in terms of cost, of our chances of creating at least a reasonable proportion of sustainable energy sources. <br><br>Again - not anything like the cheapness we currently enjoy in the West. The question then is: what cost level will start to unravel the web of our social systems irrevocably? What's enough to kill people?<br><br>Which brings me to my last point: the kind of catastrophe we talk about has already happened to millions, and continues to happen. We're - anyone able to write here - an insulated elite. This doesn't quite fit into the grand narrative of either global apocalypse or global salvation-through-crisis. Crises affecting millions are happening all the time. We just privilege our own crisis narratives and find ourselves ignoring everyone else's actual daily existence.<br><br>An open mind and clear sight is vital at this time, but I'm not sure any of us can have much surety about how things are going to go. You have a clarity of sight that I, for one, deeply appreciate reading, but I wonder if there's just a little of the obverse of the "transitionista's" gleeful egging on of Peak Oil?<br><br><a href=#c8679136594362686722 title="comment permalink">9/17/09, 9:25 AM</a><br><br>

I think I've been subconsciously awaiting something like this... <br><br>I wanted to point out something along the lines of this Daydream of Destruction. Time after time I will read comments (on various blogs) from all kinds of people about how in the future more people will resort to stealing and brutalism due to the descent of abundant energy or due to a lack of food and water. I find that is a major romanticism and perhaps a daydream as well. If we look to Detroit, a city which is a decent portrait of the future of all cities, there is obviously a lot of crime and dysfunction. It was at one time a murder capital.

I felt a little bad about making you into a poster child for a set of attitudes I felt badly needed to be discussed and critiqued. You have to make your own choices, of course, but if your life doesn't satisfy your needs, it seems to me that you're a lot better off changing it than waiting for someone or something else to change it for you. <br><br>The martial arts metaphor is far from outdated, and can readily be applied to what I've been trying to say. If the life you live has become an enemy to meaning, act as a samurai would; dismiss all other considerations, and cut it through.<br><br>Twilight, excellent. Television is one of the best examples of what I've been trying to talk about here. I know a huge number of people who complain about all the advertising, the dumbing-down of the programs, etc., etc. -- and who still sit down in front of the thing every day. There is such a thing as an off switch. <br><br>The last television my wife and I ever owned met its end in 1984. We had been keeping it in the closet underneath the vacuum cleaner. it got pulled out at some point and turned on, and didn't work. We looked at each other; I took it out onto the second floor fire escape, and dropped it straight into the apartment dumpster. The flash as the picture tube imploded was profoundly satisfying. <br><br>Publius, poor people commit suicide at least as often as rich people, and there's no shortage of help out there for people who genuinely want to get in touch with the sources of meaning in their lives. It's easy to blame modernity for spiritual malaise, but a little reading in the classics of spirituality will show very quickly that people have been wrestling with exactly the same problems since the beginning of recorded history, and probably long before that. Mind you, the malaise is real, but it can't be dealt with by changing the world, much less by waiting for something else to change the world -- it can only be dealt with by change within the individual self. <br><br>Blue Sun, if people want community, they need to roll up their sleeves and build it. Decline and fall won't do the work for them. My experience, though, is that most people who talk the communitarian line want the benefits of community without the commitments and costs. <br><br>Shiner, for heaven's sake, if you want a challenge, there are plenty out there. You don't need to wait for the world to hand you one. <br><br>Dan, of course you're right that millions of people in the world today are already experiencing what we will be experiencing in the decades to come. I'm less sure I agree with you about having more energy than people did three or four centuries ago; by the time we get to the bottom of the depletion curves, my guess is that this will not be true, as most "alternative" energy sources depend on energy subsidies from fossil fuels and are not viable without those.<br><br><a href=#c9010800919965640835 title="comment permalink">9/17/09, 10:34 AM</a><br><br>

Twice, in fact.<br><br>Childhood camping experiences were instructive. Yeah, sure, there was the beauty of nature, yadda, yadda, but washing dishes in boiled water and drawing a bath without running water and writing by lantern light was something I was sure glad to return home from. <br><br>Then, as a young adult, I had my power shut off for a few days over an upaid light bill. Now, mind you, I still had the gas heat from the bldg. boiler and a gas stove and flashlights and a portable radio. Let me tell you that I felt like kissing the meter after I got the power turned back on!<br><br>I am one of the few people I know who had a great-grandparent clear into adulthood. My great-grandma was born in 1881 and died in 1978. She grew up on a farm in KY, and she and her husband were glad to sell it in the early 20th and open a general store. When we took her to St. Louis and cleaned out her large 1860-vintage house in Armstrong MO, a tiny hamlet, we found crates of the harsh,hand-made naptha soap she made in the 30s, in this hamlet that had no power in those days. She used that soap to wash clothes and dishes and take a bath and do whatever else had to be done. She said it was the gladdest day of her life when the house was finally wired and she acquired a wringer washing machine. She said her life before the 40s was one unremitting round of physically exhausting household chores. Doing the wash for her family of 7 took the entire day and was brutally exhausting. Boiling the water on the wood stove and then starching the crap and then hanging it to dry, which in the winter took days. Waking up in the freezing Missouri winter and cracking the ice on the washbowl in a freezing room. <br><br>Oh, yeah, how joyous and fulfilling it was!<br><br><a href=#c3712486768142446899 title="comment permalink">9/17/09, 10:53 AM</a><br><br>

Even if I was exposed I would be too worn down and undereducated to see the value in it.

All those freedoms will be narrowing for most soon.<br><br> PBS had a quality reality show a couple years back called Colonial House. In the show volunteers tried to live as people lived in colonial days.

Some time in the 4th or 5th century the cities of Christian North Africa were rocked by violent riots triggered by disagreements over whether the sacraments were effective if bestowed by a priest who was himself in a state of mortal sin. According to their own theology of the time such disagreements were nonsense, because it is God who bestows the sacrament: the priest was only a conduit and his own spiritual state had no bearing so long as the rite was correctly performed. The truth of the matter was that Roman civilization was breaking down and these people were losing the administrative structure upon which their grain shipments and their defense depended. They knew they were going to die, but they had no economic or political vocabulary to articulate their anger and terror. They had only the language of religion, so they used it: a civilization-wide case of looking where the light is better. It seems to me that "Tony" does much the same thing. He is actually experiencing a genuine oppression: it is not imaginary as you imply, and I think it is not just a case of him being secretly too content with his own comfort to change his life. The oppression felt by the inhabitants of the modern world has no easily identifiable source. A pre-modern slave might have hated his master, but he knew who the master was. The modern predicament is more like the case laid out by the guy in "Grapes of Wrath": the bank that takes his home is a shadowy, faceless organization with no location or identity, "alive without breath" as Tolkien said. Noam Chomsky seems to have felt the same thing: he once remarked that people who wrote to him from the poorest countries always knew exactly what needed to be done, but correspondents from wealthy countries routinely told him they felt powerless and confused and unable to settle on a course of action. "Tony" doesn't really want civilization to collapse: you are right about that. I think what he really hungers for, is to know where to turn for guidance, but he doesn't know how too articulate that need, let alone how to satisfy it. Which is why religion is going to play such a resurgent role in the next few chapters of religion, as I believe Spengler said as well. Thanks for another fine essay.

I also think this is why sudden apocalyptic scenarios are popular among some, for it places this within reach of their lifetimes rather than a long descent in which it will be a completely different generation once the descent period is over.<br><br>There's the issue of our personal lives, which most of us are in agreement has to do with inner fulfillment. However, do you not agree that outside events can influence inner fulfillment, and one of those is watching the environment being destroyed around you constantly, and industrial chemicals contaminating our bodies. Not that there aren't people finding fulfillment despite that, and of course there have been plenty of obstacles to fulfillment in times past too. However I do think about these things a lot, partly because of chemical sensitivites I have, luckinly they are not super severe and I have made slow progress in overcoming them, but they still make many things that most in our society consider routine to be challenging to myself.<br><br>I do think there's a possibility of a better future for humanity (and the biosphere) as a whole down the line, just pretty far down the line in the descent scenario. That is defining better as more fulfilling for a greater number of people, and also in greater balance with the biosphere. However, I do accept this is in the very long term, and it's only a possibility, not an inevitability. I certainly do not propose "waiting around for the world to end" as, except for a miracle which I'm not counting on, it is only hard work by determined people that can steer things in the right direction for this outcome to take place.<br><br>I think not only for myself but for most others I know who are aware of the situation, we have a mental paradox going on, we know that when collapse starts our lives and those we love are very likely to take a turn for the worse, we also know that the longer modern civilization's destructive effects last, the worse it's going to get in the end, so we both dread it but part of us longs for it too, part which I'm fully aware I'll probably come to regret when I'm dealing with it as reality.<br><br>I am looking forward to hearing more details of your cultural conservers foundation, as I do believe there are many aspects of modern society that are worth preserving. However I think the most important aspects to conserve are natural ones, and the cultural practices that can sustain these. All the other cultural aspects are dependent on our relationship with the Earth. I have many disagreements with some conservationists however, as many see conservation as museums of what it was like before 1491 (in America). While it may be useful to have certain areas like this, with the realities of climate change, human dispersal, etc., we need to accept that "nature" will be different in the future, as it always has changed, it's just doing so much faster because of us now. We need to conserve our soil, which all other life on land is dependent, and biodiversity, which includes assisting species migrating to new refuges to adapt to climate change that might not be able to move so fast on their own, or might be blocked by destroyed habitat. For every species lost is one fewer puzzle piece for the new nature to reorganize. What would you think of a "biological conservers foundation"<br><br>P.S. Have you ever read "Permaculture: Principles and Practices Beyond Sustainability" by David Holmgren, you and he seem to share many ideas, although agriculture is a main there, he also branches out into so many other aspects of natural and human systems, that book has been my number one inspiration.<br><br><a href=#c5334489839618083596 title="comment permalink">9/17/09, 7:30 PM</a><br><br>

As the de facto priesthood of the religion of progress, I suppose they get a double dose of our civilization's hubris. <br><br>Seaweed Shark, the comparison's forced; there was much more going on behind the riots you've mentioned than a displaced fear that the empire was falling. Still, that's a discussion for a different time. The point I'd make here is that the people who claim to be longing for the end of the current empire aren't rioting about anything. They're playing with toy soldiers and thinking that that's what war is like. <br><br>Trebor, thanks for the quote!<br><br>John, it's common for people who don't want to embrace needed change to hope that some outside factor will force the decision they're not willing to take themselves. I suspect that this is an example of the same thing. <br><br>RJ, you'd think so, but very often the poor just want to get rich themselves. <br><br>Satori, I don't expect anything so organized -- more likely, as in the former Soviet Union, a lot of people will simply drink themselves to death. <br><br>Ahavah, you're confusing two different issues. If your plans for peak oil depend on your husband's job, that's difficult. If your sense of meaning and purpose in life depends on your husband's job, that's appalling. In critiquing Tony's comments about the end of the industrial age, I was talking about the latter, not the former. Mind you, you might consider retooling your peak oil plans to focus less on having things (like a house) and more on having skills; what you know and can do can't be taken away from you, and will make you all the more likely to succeed in a community where other people haven't learned the skills they'll need. <br><br>Dan, agreed -- it's definitely a good conversation. <br><br>Kevin, I don't know that anyone has taken the time to slog through the math on oceanic uranium, as it's patently absurd -- the energy that would be needed to extract any usable quantity of U-238 from the 0.003 parts per million of uranium that's dissolved in sea water would be a good deal more than the energy that would be produced by putting it in a reactor. The problem with geothermal energy, except in those few favored spots where it's unusually accessible, is the same: net energy. I don't have references to hand at the moment but there ought to be some good sources on geothermal net energy on the web. <br><br>Provo, you'll see more pokes at Jensen and Quinn if you hang around here; I'm not a fan of theirs. If you have children and a grandchild, you've helped cause the problem you claim to be addressing; that smacks of hypocrisy. <br><br>Mark, that's an excellent metaphor. The only problem is that the patient won't go into a hospice, or accept any kind of treatment at all.<br><br><a href=#c4789770679914949822 title="comment permalink">9/17/09, 7:41 PM</a><br><br>

The solar panels are caked with dust. The landscape is overgrown anywhere it's not underwatered. The meetings generally are run with the social mores of junior high school; never mind everybody has at least a masters degree. The fruit trees get stripped in the middle of the night. I could go on. <br><br>Modern people have NO IDEA of the kind of social organization that it takes to operate on a subsistence farming level. A huge part of it involves gritting your teeth and working with people who annoy you and/or staying married to a nutcase. The reason Mexican dishwashers look relaxed is because they know they get two days off per week; an unthinkable luxury on a farm. <br><br>Permaculture teachers (is there any other kind?) will immediately show you computer presentations of swales cut with graders and drip irrigation systems. Graders? Drip? If they were really working farmers they would be comparing hoe styles, kama vs. machete and talking about fencing. Try producing 80 yards of mulch with a machete and you'll see why they need a rethink. <br><br>Lets not go into the horrors of low-tech medicine. Boiled cockroaches would be an improvement on some of the Traditional Chinese Medical brews I've downed.

The same point is in many economics 101 textbooks: will you spend your earnings on pizza and gin, or save it to invest in a college education or a house? Something that will bring returns later. If we can treat fuels as investment, there's scope for building enough renewables to - at least - avoid the scenario of grovelling in the mud to feed ourselves that you outline. Such a future might not be a decentralised utopia: imagine if our major power sources continue to be e.g. <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manapouri_Power_Station rel=nofollow>like Manapouri in New Zealand</a>. Even if we only had these, though, I can see how they could - if their output is 'invested' - leverage further energy outputs. (I imagine some might respond, there's a basic thermodynamic law there, but that's an error in this case.)<br><br>Like having the energy to crank the handle on an old car, its a question of whether we're able to invest enough to keep a non-fossil system going, and perhaps expand it slowly over time. Nathan Lewis asks: what is required to have as much energy as we have now; that's the wrong question. Can we build systems with enough energy to keep us from a medieval life? Can we, like the human brain, evolve as a social-cognitive system to be efficient users of that energy?<br><br>Question, then: what leads you to conclude that, at the end of our fossil energy descent, we'll be back where we started (except with billions more people?) A lot rests on this question and I'm keen for as much evidence, argument and information as possible!

The "Industrial Revolution" which is a phrase that encompasses the leeching of the planet's resources by humanity, is the outcome of a higher problem. Let me explain. <br><br>Much of the human race, in its dense, industrialized cities and suburbs around the world is a grand picture of parasitical work in action. As Agent Smith in "The Matrix" explains: <br><br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Na9-jV_OJI <br><br>This paints an accurate picture of how Industrialization has infected humanity, and how humanity now infects this precious Earth. Our grand cities are centers of our parasitical action. Slowly draining the life-force of this planet. Before Industrialization humanity was closer to the Earth - a part of it. Now, we view ourselves as "conquerors" of our dominion. We are "sons of God" charged to subdue the Earth, an ingrained mindset given to us from a literal view of Genesis. A view embraced by all Fundamentalist monotheistic religions. <br><br>Toxic religion (toxic spirituality) was one of the fuels which drove the Industrialization of humanity, without the thought of the consequences. Dispensationalist Christianity tells us that Jesus is coming back any moment to transform and renew the Earth. Again, no thought of the consequences for future generations since Jesus is "gonna make it all better". I know this is simplistic, but one cannot deny that monotheistic, conservative religion has been a MAJOR factor in bringing us to where we are today. <br><br>Yet this is still not the main issue. "As above, so below" is an esoteric axiom. There is a reason why humanity has traveled down the road of Nature abuse and has become the parasitical cancer of this planet - a parasitical force that now threatens all of life. <br><br>Instead of going into great detail in explaining this, let me guide you to the most insightful and well reasoned explanation of how and why humanity has transformed into a parasitical force: <br><br>http://www.zaporacle.com/textpattern/article/6/mind-parasites-energy-parasites-and-vampires <br><br>http://www.zaporacle.com/wp/2009/06/mind-parasite-matrix-audio-files/ <br><br>Jonathan Zap of www.zaporacle.com has uncovered one of the most important truths of our age and his "Mind Parasites" work is, I believe, one of the most critical works to arise in modern times. Please take the time to read his work and listen to his audio messages on the Mind Parasite Matrix (the online version above is an greatly edited version of over eight hours of lecture on the subject). <br><br>The Mind Parasite Matrix is one of (if not thee) reasons behind the Industrialization of the world and the horrible state that we now find ourselves in environmentally. We are victims, just as the Earth is victimized by us.<br><br><a href=#c8707477000840321326 title="comment permalink">9/19/09, 12:35 AM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c8693040588098306748></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/13348352152011800146 rel=nofollow>Isis</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>JMG, <br><br>I think you're oversimplifying matters. First, two quotes of yours: <br><br>"The fact that a life lived in material comfort can be unsatisfying does not mean that the comfort is what makes it unsatisfying." <br><br>"If Tony and his countless equivalents want “a chance to really live,” in other words, nothing is holding them back. If they feel their present comforts are obstacles to a better life, nothing prevents them from getting rid of those comforts." <br><br>Now, I'd like to make two (related) points. First, 'comfort' can, in fact, be a source of major discomfort. Second, there are two different kinds of poverty: absolute poverty (where a person can hardly keep body and soul together), and relative poverty (where a person lacks the resources to fully participate in social and civic life; the more affluent the society, the wealthier one needs to be in order to be able to fully participate in it). <br><br>My favorite example for illustrating both of these points is the cell phone. I don't have one. I refuse to get one for a host of reasons (cost, annoyance, possible radiation, harm caused by cell phone towers, and so on and so forth). I do, in all honesty, believe that my life is better without a cell phone than it would be if I did have one (even if someone else were to foot the bill). This illustrates my first point. <br><br>For my second point: living without a cell phone in a society where everyone else has one carries social costs that it would not carry in a society where cell phones are a rarity (or even better: non-existent). For example, my friends generally communicate with people using these things, and that means that I get left out of a number of things because I'm 'inconvenient' to reach. If I lived in a society where nobody had a cell, this wouldn't be an issue because then I'd have the luxury of being just as reachable as everyone else, and planning in advance would be the standard, and not an inconvenience associated with dealing with cell-less eccentrics such as myself. <br><br>Now, it may be that one of these days I'll decide that, in fact, living without a cell phone in a society where such gadgets are ubiquitous is simply not worth it, and I may cave in and get one. But one way or the other, I feel very confident saying that, whether or not I had a cell, I would be better off if all cell phones suddenly vanished into thin air. My not having a cell phone in a society such as ours is _not_ equivalent to living in a society in which having a cell phone is no longer considered a norm. (And there goes my favorite daydream of destruction!) <br><br>I could do the same exercise for a number of other things, including corporate jobs and such, but I want to keep this (relatively...) brief. Ultimately, the point is that, as long as we retain access to basic necessities of life, the disappearance (at the societal level, and not merely at the personal level) of many, many (though by no means all) 'comforts' that we 'enjoy' today is likely to yield net benefits. <br><br>Of course, the fact that many people (myself possibly included) are likely to see their access to basic necessities curtailed is a whole different issue.<br><br><a href=#c8693040588098306748 title="comment permalink">9/19/09, 5:37 AM</a><br><br>

My comments, or rather question, will appear in the following,contextualizing paragraph.<br><br>Nate Hagens recently posted a Joseph Tainter speech (TOD, Sept 9)which was largely on the topic of societal complexity and sustainability.

I am finding my thoughts much more in line with your view of us simply muddling along through the upheavel of global industrial collapse. <br><br>I do however find myself in disagreement with your thought that history is not tending towards progress of some sort. From what I have read of the origin and evolution on life it seems that life has been exponentially increasing in complexity over the last 4 billion years. Somewhere I have heard that the human nueral cortex is itself the most complex object in the universe. That being the case isn't it somewhat tempting to assume that the humans are more complete and progressed than other organisms? Our history too as humans also doesn't seem to be aimless; language, written word, and long distance communication seem to be further extensions that allow us to probe deeper and deeper towards something yet to be defined.<br><br>I don't however put much stock in this trend and am assuming that we will see the collapse of industrialism. To prepare I'm working on a wide range of skill sets and accompaning life experiences. Yet in the back of my mind I really admit I find it hard to contemplate that the indutrial era was essentially an aimless sort of deadend that mankind walked into.<br><br><a href=#c2344375841734457157 title="comment permalink">9/19/09, 11:56 AM</a><br><br>

I would nonetheless be interested in your view. Disclosure: as a reader of energy issues since the late 1990s (yes, I started with the Die-Off site), I confess I tend to go with your reading.<br>Secondly, I for one would welcome your "putting on the druid's hat" more often so that it might inform your writings more thoroughly . Though not a scholar in terms of specialization, I have more than dabbled in the history of religion(s)and the realm of spirituality. Yours being one which I have unfortunately neglected more than most, though I share your enthusiasm (if that's the word here) for Stoicism. Of course it isn't a question of this or that "Truth" winning out. All spirituality is a vehicle for roughly the same truths. One of which could well be that the development of human life from childhood needs mediation. People need to be ritually introduced to the idea that they are, each one individually, the center of the universe. And, on the other hand, the need is no less pressing for them to understand how they are, individually, decidedly NOT the center of anything at all! Otherwise, they will never be prepared to accept the innumerable paradoxes and contradictions they will inevitably encounter in their lives.<br>What has filtered through on this subject from your articles is already enriching and I promise to check out the side-bar references and others to flesh out my knowledge of Druidism.<br>I'll close with a modest reference: Pierre Legendre, institutional historian and author of a series of 8 "Leçons" (yes, I live in France) among many other books, makes a very good case, by means of legal history, art history and psychology (Okay, he's a tad too strictly Freudian for me but it's powerful stuff) for the absolute (that's the right word!) necessity of social participants of all stripes to be initiated! I imagine it exists in translation. I particularly recommend volumes 3,4 and 7 of the Leçons.<br>Many thanks if you've been patient enough to read this.<br>J Gav<br><br><a href=#c3799577387507156218 title="comment permalink">9/19/09, 12:54 PM</a><br><br>

I am still interested in him in relationship to other emanationist theories and cosmogonies.<br><br> Also, it should be noted that in the 70's (and earlier), the buzzphrase was "integrating East and West", and so many saw Aurobindo as a forerunner of this project, which seems a plausible project.<br><br> At any rate, the idea was to integrate the western upward linear trajectory - the cosmos moving toward greater and greater degrees of perfection - with the eastern idea of universal cycles to yield the upward-moving spiral.<br><br> It should also be noted that many in the 2012 camp have been influenced by legitimate and intelligent investigation of entheogens.<br><br> Graham Hancock has a recent book out called "Supernatural" that investigates the idea that entheogenic shamanism involves tapping into a DNA archive, and along with Jeremy Narby, proposes the possibility that DNA is a form of biotechnology that contains a whole database of genetic evolution that can be "read" via visionary experience.<br><br> These ideas are, of course, extrapolations of theories of panspermia and directed panspermia.

Good for you. <br><br>Juan, thank you. We're still in the process of settling in, but yes, I'll be exploring events here in the Cumberland area in the not too distant future; I've already talked with a couple of bookstores. If you know of any good venues, I can be reached via info (at) aoda (dot) org. <br><br>Quantum, yes, it's simplistic. Rather too simplistic for my tastes, to be frank.<br><br>Isis, of course you'd be more comfortable, and have an easier time with certain things, if the technologies you choose not to use were to vanish. Does that make those technologies an obstacle to a meaningful life? I don't see how that works -- and I don't own a cell phone either, by the way. <br><br>Gav, you're quite correct. To be precise, I see a society's maximum attainable social complexity as a function of net energy per capita. A society may be less complex than its net energy basis will permit, for a variety of reasons, but it can't be more complex. I'm still working out the details, but I'm coming to think that decreasing net energy per capita, in a society that has already topped out at its maximum attainable complexity, is the most common cause of the decline and fall of civilizations. <br><br>Danby, understood. I hope the farming works out for you!<br><br>Kabir, the most complex material substance in the known universe is fertile topsoil. Pound for pound, it's much more complex than the human brain. More generally, it's a common fallacy that evolution has proceeded in the direction of greater complexity over time. <br><br>Not so; the complexity of the biosphere has increased and decreased over geological time, mostly as a function of climate change (the warmer the planet, the more complex the biosphere). Organisms show no particular progression in the direction of complexity; nor, once the effects of the brief window of fossil fuel exploitation are taken out of the picture, does human history. All that's a projection of the religion of progress onto the inkblot patterns of the evolutionary past. <br><br>Gav, an enthusiastic Stoic would be quite a sight! No, I hadn't encountered Legendre; I'll see if I can find his work. I read French tolerably well, so translations won't be necessary.<br><br><a href=#c889298386276807942 title="comment permalink">9/19/09, 1:25 PM</a><br><br>

Each generation of visionaries convinces itself, and a lot of other people, that it's finally gotten the true history of the planet, and forgets that the last generation made exactly the same claims for totally different narratives. (Of course it doesn't help that when the claims can be tested in the world of fact, they consistently prove inaccurate.) As Henri Corbin points out in his useful essay "Mundus Imaginalis," the realm accessed by visionary experience cannot simply be mapped onto the world of concrete fact; the relationship between the two is complex, and those who miss that complexity routinely end up pursuing (and preaching) absurdities.<br><br><a href=#c7747355143926296891 title="comment permalink">9/19/09, 1:47 PM</a><br><br>

It's a continuum, always. I suppose it's possible to lead a 'meaningful life' on the death row in a maximum security prison, but that hardly means that being on a death row in a maximum security prison does not represent an obstacle to a meaningful life. And even the most fortunate of us sometimes engage in soul-draining activities (although what activities count as soul-draining depends on the individual). <br><br>Second, it's not simply a matter of whether or not I choose to use a certain technology. It's perfectly possible to own a cell phone, use it all the time, and hate it with passion. For example, if your employer requires you to have one, and uses it to keep you on a leash 24/7. That's an obstacle to a meaningful life. <br><br>Third, consider the amount of work that you have to put in in order to obtain a minimal level of affluence required for full (or even half-full) participation in the social and civic life of a technological society. If you have to pull double shifts in order to obtain those 'comforts', and if your society requires you to have them or else excludes you from social and civic life, then yes, those 'comforts' represent an obstacle to a meaningful life. <br><br>Or take such things as electronic music. As it becomes more and more available, fewer and fewer people get together to play and sing together. Even if you personally would like to do so, it becomes hard to find company for it. (Sure, if you're quite good, you'll be able to. But if you're just a regular person with no musical training who sings off key but really enjoys it anyway, then it gets much harder.) So there's another way in which technology can be an obstacle to a meaningful life. <br><br>And I don't suppose I need to tell you about people who actually produce our 'comforts'. <br><br>The cost of all these comforts (both for those who produce them, and for those who 'enjoy' them) is the loss of free time and non-commercialized interaction among people. People who know more about this than I do claim that medieval peasants had more free time than we do. In fact, has there ever been a non-industrial society in which people had less free time on average than we do today? The price of all this technology has been the loss of free time, and yes, that counts as an obstacle to a meaningful life in my book. <br><br>None of this is to say that industrialization hasn't made life easier and more exciting in some ways. What I am saying is that the cost of this has been high indeed. And that as we deindustrialize, some of those costs (though by no means all: much permanent damage has been done) will disappear or be reduced. (And yes, of course, some costs that we don't have to pay now will reappear.) <br><br>And one more time, just in case: I'm not saying that it is impossible to have a meaningful life in a technological society (see my first paragraph). I am saying that a technological society, in some ways, drains meaning from our lives. And I would say that it does so more than do many other human societies. It remains to be seen how a deindustrialized world will compare on this front to the world we live in today.<br><br><a href=#c8917116899852939076 title="comment permalink">9/19/09, 2:28 PM</a><br><br>

Very interesting.<br><br>I am still chewing on much of this piece. Though heavy and hard to swallow, so true in so many ways. My one question is around the comment that <i>"Peak oil, global warming, and all the other crises gathering around the world are all manifestations of a single root cause: the impossibility of infinite growth on a finite planet."</i><br><br>Initially I didn't agree with this statement. Then I agreed with it. And now, I don't agree again. Here's why: The American Revolution was a push for continued growth through space (infinite physical growth). The colonists at the time pushed for independence so that they may live a lifestyle that rejected the British wage labor system which was arising as a result of the oncoming period marked by the market revolution. The constitution, in turn, was a counter revolution to the American Revolution in that the framers (Federalists) recognized that a republic could not be founded on virtue, but rather that it must be founded on one's tendency to seek what is best for him/her self. This formation of liberal thinking embraced manufacturing and systematically tied the U.S. up in a system of debt and interdependency with society's most dangerous citizens: the wealthy.<br><br>At this point, in my thinking, I began to agree with you because it became clear to me that essentially the founding fathers recognized that infinite economic growth was essential for this new form of society to remain in order and to avoid anarchy. And economics, as you have so beautifully articulated, is dependent on ecology. In other words, the constitutional framers didn't really change the game, they just tweeked the rules and channeled the desire for infinite growth into another sector of human life. <br><br>However, I think there is a finer point to this that I either missed (entirely possible) or it wasn't addressed here.<br><br>We can have infinite growth, indeed, but that effort, which I believe is innate within us, must be channeled into the right realms of the human being in order to avoid plundering our resource base and creating, ultimately, collapse. If the universe is expanding, then we have a growing resource base, and I believe it will continue to expand indefinitely. Then the question is how do we tap this ever expanding resource? By connecting with the true source of the universe itself. I'll leave you and your readers to decide how to articulate that which is the source of our universe and simply say that, essentially, this need for expansion is a real need that must be addressed. It is our will to live. It is our drive. Without, we fold the cards and go home. Growth is life and without growth we die. I think it is wasteful and harmful to address this human need, however, in a physical or cultural sense. Only when channeled into the spiritual realm can meeting this need be less than devastating and even become one of our greatest achievements ever.<br><br>The roots of our problems as you mentioned are not found in an impossibility of infinite growth on a finite planet. They are the manifestation of a good and well meaning intention to meet a basic human need. Truly, the path to hell is paved with good intentions. And indeed, as "Tony" pointed out, materialism is at the root of this problem.<br><br>Mahalo<br>Mat<br><br><a href=#c4023236670252982697 title="comment permalink">9/20/09, 12:48 AM</a><br><br>

It's not so much a question of whether the tasks we are required to perform are boring and mundane; it's that those tasks are not seen as a part of a bigger story. <br><br>Perhaps this isn't inherent flaw of the industrial/technological civilization (after all, countless people have been inspired by the stories of 'progress', of 'conquering nature', of a 'global village', etc.), but whether anyone likes it or not, this civilization is on its way out. And dying civilizations simply do not inspire. <br><br>So I think that what 'daydreams of destruction' really amount to is a hope for a new story.

Firstly, this seems terribly like ends-justify-means thinking, in which the negative consequences of one’s decision for other people (e.g. friends &amp; family), or the violation of some strongly held social norm, are considered worth it as long as it’s important enough to the person. Now - and I in no way accuse you of this but I feel compelled to point out the extreme end of this perspective - psychopaths routinely violate norms and disregard the feelings of others in the pursuit of their own desires (in fact, the incapacity to feel guilt over “moral” violations is considered one of the defining features of psychopathy). That people feel constrained by how their choices will affect those around them is evidence for their humanity, not some character defect or failure of willpower. <br><br>Secondly - and we have disagreed over this in the past - you seem to ignore the effects of context and the fact that, cetis paribus, bigger trade-offs to a decision will tend to increase a person’s reluctance to take that path; this is what Tom Slee, author of <i>No One Makes You Shop At Wal-Mart</i>, refers to as “transaction costs.” When you wrote, <i>if they feel their present comforts are obstacles to a better life, nothing prevents them from getting rid of those comforts</i>, Isis disagreed with you by providing an example of a transaction cost that would have to be paid for fewer cell-phone related annoyances: sacrificed access to friends and family. It is disingenuous to suggest that “nothing” stands in the way; such choices are not clear-cut (i.e. options on the pareto-frontier are “efficient” in that you can’t improve on one axis of consideration – e.g. fewer annoyances - without losses on another – e.g. fewer social opportunities) and treating them as if they are simply ignores the challenges faced when making complex decisions, and for that matter, also people’s actual cognitive processes.<br><br><a href=#c7469010229506178018 title="comment permalink">9/21/09, 4:04 AM</a><br><br>

In fact, they display some amazing biases; for example, framing something as a potential loss tends to make people more risk-averse, whereas the exact same situation will generate risk-taking behaviours when framed according to potential gains (p. 81). People will also almost always take a “sure thing” even when the alternative option, with a slight risk of getting nothing, is still the rationally better choice (p. 73) (i.e. “a bird in the hand…”). Another one: our understanding of money is inextricably linked to food, so that people are less likely to donate to charities when hungry than when full and when put in a state of “high desire for money” people eat more M&amp;Ms than when in a “low desire for money” (p. 75-76).<br><br>Behavioural economist Dan Ariely’s book, <i>Predictably Irrational</i> is full of other such cognitive biases that affect people’s choices. The “decoy effect” (p. 8) , aka “non-independence of irrelevant alternatives,” means that if you add an option (a2) that isn’t on the pareto-frontier, but is clustered near an option that is (a1), people will tend to choose (a1) rather than some other alternative that is also on the pareto-frontier (b1), so you can affect people’s choices by including an “irrelevant alternative” or “decoy.” Or, consider that people operate with both market norms and social norms (p. 71), and that introducing market norms tends to block any social norms that might otherwise apply to a situation – so don’t offer to pay the in-laws for a delicious meal, although you can bring a gift of wine. Furthermore, people have a “need for uniqueness” (p. 237) in individualistic societies - and its inverse in collective ones – meaning that when people express their preferences publicly and in sequence (e.g. ordering at a restaurant) they tend to choose something other than what they actually want if someone else has - or has not - ordered it before them. <br><br>A big one is “arbitrary coherence” (p. 32), where our willingness to pay various prices for something is basically determined by an arbitrary “anchor price,” or the price we initially encountered for similar items. Add this to herding - and self-herding - (p. 36), which describe how we look to others - or our own past - as a guide to how to behave, and one can see that preferences are largely relative and social. An even bigger one is how being in a state of emotional/sexual arousal generates completely different preferences (generally, we are less “moral” and more willing to take risks) than when in a non-aroused state, and people are largely unable to predict the preferences of one while in the other (p. 96). A last example, is how swearing on a bible – even if you’re atheist – or on MIT’s “Honour Code” – even though they don’t have one, but you didn’t know that – will make a person less likely to cheat or behave dishonestly on a task that immediately follows (p. 198). Okay, one more: people are much less likely to steal actual cash than non-monetary goods (p. 217), even non-monetary currencies (e.g. tokens immediately substitutable for cash).<br><br>What I’m getting at is that people’s choices are largely non-conscious, subject to an array of cognitive distortions and biases, and heavily influenced by contextual factors. So much so, in fact, that Ariely’s one main lesson from his research is that, “…we are pawns in a game whose forces we largely fail to comprehend… we usually think of ourselves as [in] ultimate control over the decisions we make… but, alas, this perception has more to do with… how we want to view ourselves… than with reality,” (p. 243). In other words, it’s really not so simple as to just “choose” what you “really” want regardless of anyone or anything else. And, while awareness of such biases may assist with reducing some of the effect they have, they permeate our cognition and decision-making and can never be completely eliminated.<br><br><a href=#c3927742216486565708 title="comment permalink">9/21/09, 4:08 AM</a><br><br>

How much <i>daydream</i> theorizing is in these "sure" predictions?<br><br>I suspect that we know very little of how natural or even anthropogenic overshoots play out.

People need to find meaning in their lives that makes sense to them. I just think it’s disingenuous to suggest that feeling conflicted about the effects that your choices will have on others shouldn’t be a factor.<br> <br>It clearly <i>is</i> a factor for most people most of the time and ignoring it ignores how our cognitive systems actually work. And as a result, prescriptions that rely on it will tend not to work for most people most of the time, just as - in the vein of what Publius wrote - telling the poor to lift themselves up by their bootstraps won’t work for most poor people most of the time because it ignores the structural factors that keep pushing them down.<br><br><i>Argue for your limitations, and sure enough, they're yours.</i><br><br>My point was that it doesn’t matter whether you recognize, or argue for, the cognitive limitations I mentioned or not because they are with you regardless. Ignoring them doesn’t make them go away; if anything, the only way to gain even a modicum of control over them is to become aware of them, but even that doesn’t make them vanish.<br><br>Yes, if you rationalize something, you will come to believe it. Actually, this is another interesting cognitive bias: you can get anyone to believe just about anything simply by having them come up with a few of their own reasons why it would be true (p. 64, <i>Kluge</i>). Even if you later tell them the evidence shows the exact opposite, the act of rationalizing the belief makes it extremely resistant to subsequent change.<br><br>I’m not trying to use this evidence of bias as an excuse to avoid the search for meaning. I’m trying to point out that “choice” is not the simple, clear-cut phenomenon that the individualism of the Enlightenment made it seem.

It has been widely demonstrated, that with the exception of situations of severe deprivation and abuse, happiness and contentment are not well correlated with external circumstances. A sad echoing of JMG's observation in his most recent comment that "meaning is not given to you by your circumstances" was tragically in evidence when we moved to Colorado in the 1990s. Those were the boom times, and Colorado was one of the boomtown utopias where the Good Life was to be found. Yet, suicide rates were alarmingly high, especially among single men. It appeared that these men had moved to utopia, only to find that their emptiness and despair had moved with them. <br><br>In the U.S., becoming a rural peasant is exceedingly easy. Disused homesteads with collapsed property values litter the landscape over vast areas, many of which have almost no building codes or zoning restrictions. There are very few barriers to this lifestyle choice, economic, legal, or societal, if it is truly your path. If you really think a world without TV or cell phone reception, broadband internet, effective law enforcement, actual wage-paying jobs, or minimally passable public schools would bring you inner peace, you could be living in that world by the end of next month. Very little stands in your way. <br><br>Having said that, I do think that deindustrialization will inevitably reverse the steady trends in western society of increasing isolation, virtualization of experience, and loss of comprehension of our essential biological nature. Speaking metaphysically and judgmentally for a moment, I do consider these trends to be among the core disfunctions of contemporary society. Hence I will not shed a tear over their passing. However, I recognize this shift is more likely to be manifested through such things as disease and hardship than through revelation and illuminated thought. Such is the way of history.<br><br><a href=#c3661842858553261948 title="comment permalink">9/21/09, 10:13 PM</a><br><br>

In the absence of a reflective and purposeful inner life, granted, they tend to play a large role, and it's for this precise reason that so many philosophical and spiritual traditions include detailed instruction in methods to overcome them. <br><br>These methods aren't secret -- in fact, there's probably never been a time in the history of the world when they have been as thoroughly publicized as they are now -- and there are plenty of people who have figured them out all by themselves without reference to older traditions.

I presumed that you meant that his/her feelings for his/her own spawn were hypocritically contradictory to those he/she felt for the rest of life on the planet (in some languages they do not have separate pronouns for each gender!). I was, as I said, startled by what seemed to be an un-warranted rebuke. <br><br>Perhaps I understand the term "hypocrite" too negatively. Your application of the term to Provo's thoughts seemed quite misplaced amid the sort of fair-minded, sensible dialogue I've come to expect at your blog. While I read and enjoy the likes of Jim Kunstler's Clusterfuck Nation, and his own snarky writing style, it seems to unleash, all too often, a degeneration of sophomoric "verbal food fighting" from his commentoriat - which turns me off. I haven't seen that sort of thing here. Count me as one who appreciates the respectful adult tone that dominates your blog.<br><br>To put this in some personal terms, my wife's daughter chose to conceive and bear a child several years ago. Her son, Ezzy, is now three &amp; a half years old. I was quite perplexed and annoyed with her decision to have a child, believing that, neither, she was prepared to raise a child, nor that the planet needed any more humans added to it's rolls for the time being. It seemed, all-over-all, bad timing to me. I bit my tongue as quietly as I could.<br><br>I often think of myself as an "extra" person on the planet, much as I do most of our kind. I'm 60 years old and have had, by historic and prehistoric standards, a long and privileged life. I'm sort of "ready to go". I was somehow prescient enough to see the folly of bringing children into this overloaded world on my own gene line, and took steps to preclude that possibility (..if I DO have any children - they never call or write).<br><br>I care about the survival and welfare of my wife's grandson, and wish him well. At the same time, I worry about the survival and welfare of so much of the rest of life on Earth. Do such competing affections brand me a hypocrite? Maybe? I do like to occasionally boast: "I am a hypocrite, therefore, I am". But, if you or anyone else launched such an epithet at me, I think the blood would automatically rise up my neck. (did I just now demonstrate my capacity for hypocrisy?)<br><br>Among my friends, no one is more likely to be so outspokenly "pro-abortion" as I am, but if you're here now, I don't see why your continued attendance should be questioned or challenged by me, nor do I understand why you would go to the trouble to effectively assault someone else's integrity because they fretted over the welfare of most of Earth's creatures, including their own offspring.<br><br>Am I the only person here who was taken aback by your reply to Provo? Did I read you wrong? I won't speculate on your feelings for your own late child, but I'm inclined toward sympathy at my end.<br><br>Do you have anything more to say about this ?<br><br>No angel here - just one more extra waiting for the call.<br><br>Dan<br><br><a href=#c5180361652952525188 title="comment permalink">9/22/09, 11:56 AM</a><br><br>

However, I must explicitly disagree with you that <i>all</i> cognitive distortions, illusions, and biases can be overcome.<br><br>I am trying to recognize that your point has merit, even if I can't agree that it is universally applicable, so let me finish my part in this exchange - and then let the chips fall where they may - with the following quotes from <i>Kluge</i>:<br><br><i>As a rough guide, our thinking can be divided into two streams, one that is fast, automatic, and largely unconscious, and another that is slow, deliberate, and judicious. As best we can tell, the two systems rely on fairly different neural substrates.<br><br>Even though the deliberative system is more sophisticated, the latest in evolutionary technology, it has never really gained proper control because it bases its decisions on almost invariably secondhand information, courtesy of the less-than-objective ancestral system. We can reason as carefully as we like, but, as they say in computer science jargon, "garbage in, garbage out." There's no guarantee that the ancestral system will pass along a balanced set of data</i> (p. 51-52).<br><br><i>Our ancestral system seems to be the default option... We eschew our deliberative system not just during a time crunch, but also when we are tired, distracted, or just plain lazy; using the deliberative system seems to require an act of will</i> (p. 86).<br><br>As you can see, this generally supports your position: reflection and willpower allow us to engage the deliberative system to overcome the biases of the ancestral one, assuming we recognize when we're getting "garbage in," so as to compensate for it. However, this is simply not always possible, no matter how badly you might desire - or believe - otherwise. <br><br>Awareness suffers from resource limitations, the same as everything else; I seriously doubt that even someone as capable as yourself can keep every possibly-applicable bias in mind at all times in order to be ready to correct for them, and worse, <i>when we are stressed, tired, or distracted, our deliberative system tends to be the first thing to go</i> (p. 52).<br><br><i>The unconscious influence of our ancestral system is so strong that when our conscious mind tries to get control of the situation, the effort sometimes backfires. For example, in one study, people were put under time pressure and asked to make rapid judgments. Those who were told to (deliberately) suppress sexist thoughts (themselves presumably the product of the ancestral reflexive system) actually became <b>more likely</b> than control subjects to have sexist thoughts. <br><br>Even more pernicious is the fact that as evolution layered reason on top of contextually driven memory, it left us with the <b>illusion</b> of objectivity. Evolution gave us the tools to deliberate and reason, but it didn't give us any guarantee that we'd be able to use them without interference. We feel as if our beliefs are based on cold, hard facts, but often they are shaped by our ancestral system in subtle ways that we are not even aware of</i> (p. 53).<br><br><a href=#c3373154275458048404 title="comment permalink">9/23/09, 1:27 AM</a><br><br>

You've hammered on the point that human perception has its limitations, or more specifically, that in the highly artificial environment of a laboratory, it's possible to manufacture evidence of such limitations in relation to a certain limited subset of arbitrary choices. I'm not arguing with that; I'm disagreeing with the sweeping generalization you seem to be making from that limited data set, which is that human beings lack the capacity to overcome the influence of their circumstances. <br><br>It's interesting to note that much of the debate has taken the form of conflicting attempts to frame the issue. You've tried to frame it in scientific terms: here are some specific effects observed under laboratory conditions, we can generalize from there to universals. I've tried to frame it in philosophical terms, starting from universals and moving from there to particulars. The fact that neither of us has been willing to accept the other's frame may offer some evidence that framing effects in real-world situations -- as opposed to the artificial setting of a laboratory -- may be less omnipotent than studies suggest. <br><br>But I don't see any likelihood that further discussion is going to get anywhere, and there's only so much time available to me to respond to comments. For this reason among others I think it's time to draw a line under this debate. <br><br>Das Monde, I'm not claiming that people aren't engaging in plots of one kind or another; for example, I think it's fairly well known these days that the "color revolutions" of the last decade or so were manufactured by the US intelligence community, working through a set of "nongovernmental organizations" that are nothing of the kind. Still, all the evidence suggests to me that there's no one uber-plot -- simply the usual struggles of competing power centers trying to claw their way to the top of a very unstable heap.<br><br>As for overshoot, I haven't had a chance to unpack the relevant books yet, but the examples that come to mind are deer populations near the Grand Canyon and a Great Lakes island whose name escapes me; both populations found themselves in a niche free of predators, and went through a classic boom and dieoff sequence. I don't know if that will be of any help.<br><br><a href=#c8267127649259679695 title="comment permalink">9/23/09, 7:24 AM</a><br><br>

Both experienced 95% dieoff. Overshoot is also the classic rabbit/coyote mix. The whole freaking bioshpere is in a state of overshoot if you look close enough. A clump of grass exhausts its nutrients and is replaced by a different plant that can use what is left. Some bears starve every winter. It is not a system or species wide overshoot, but the dynamic of surpassing the carrying capacity of their nutrient base is the same.<br><br>And the nice thing about that is it shows how overshoot can be very local, which JMG often mentions.<br><br><a href=#c8755007396770672252 title="comment permalink">9/23/09, 8:31 AM</a><br><br>

Clearly our problems could be ameliorated, although certainly not entirely solved, by concerted human effort but I no longer believe that this is likely to happen on any level larger than a local neighborhood or small town; there simply isn't enough time to educate and train ourselves for the new reality in time to avoid the results of the crisis (oil, environment, and economic) in which we find ourselves. Too many people also inaccurately perceive the current state of affairs as beneficial and will actively resist meaningful change. <br><br>My response has been to start learning to live with less of everything and to engage in a participative way with my environment. I read in article in Backpacker magazine that said the average through hiker on a major U.S. trail spends $500 per month to meet all his or her needs on the trail. I'm never more happy than when I am on a long hike so why do I spend so much more to maintain my day to day work life and yet feel so much less happy about it? I'm not sure but my goal is to simplify my life so that I can live at the same level of cost and consumption that I achieve as a long distance hiker. So far it hasn't actually been all that simple I've had to learn to gather wild foods, fish, hunt, garden without much in the way of fertilizer or protection from pests and begin traveling by foot without high technology gear like gortex fabrics and tents to protect me from the environment. For weeks after my decision I sat around trying to think of what I would need to live this life style and made and remade lists and compared costs etc, then I realized that I just need to engage with my plan and my environment and get about doing what I intended to do. We are so trained to expect someone to tell us what to do or a device to assist us in doing something that we forget how to engage with our environment and just start doing what needs to be done. I'm still struggling with it. I have no illusion that life will be more meaningful if I live at a simpler level but I also know that I will not be any less happy with my life either.<br><br><a href=#c3518684728402845214 title="comment permalink">9/23/09, 4:59 PM</a><br><br>
