The relation between modern industrial society and the scientific ideas that supposedly guide it is more complex than a casual glance will necessarily reveal. The ideology a society believes that it embraces and the assumptions about the world that actually underlie its actions and institutions are not uncommonly at odds with one another. It often takes the most strenuous sort of willed inattention to fail to notice the gap, but efforts toward that end can count on the support of public opinion as well as the more tangible backing provided by economic interests.<br><br>Consider the clash between the Christian and liberal values allegedly embraced by the great powers of 19th century Europe and the ruthless political and economic exploitation imposed by these same powers on the subject peoples of their huge colonial empires. The result was a rush to find some justification for European empires other than the obvious one, which was simply that Europeans wanted the wealth and power they could get by exploiting the rest of the planet. As Stephen Jay Gould chronicled in his engaging <i>The Mismeasure of Man</i>, generations of scientists thus spent their careers trying to argue that the “white race,” that imaginary and variously defined beast, was biologically superior to the other “races” on the planet.<br><br>These efforts fell afoul of a minor detail of anthropology. It so happens that people of European descent fall toward the middle range of a great many biological indices; people of African descent tend toward one end of most of these indices, and people of East Asian descent tend toward the other. Thus it proved impossible to argue, say, that Britons were superior to Africans without providing evidence that Chinese were superior to Britons, and claims that Britons were superior to Chinese ended up just as effectively proving that Africans were superior to Britons. Still, these efforts continued right up into the first half of the 20th century, because the alternative was to admit that European domination of the planet was a straightforward act of piracy backed by nothing more edifying than a temporary advantage in military technology.<br><br>The industrial nations of the early 21st century are in a very similar predicament – or, more precisely, in two very similar predicaments. On the one hand, the relationship between the industrial nations and their Third World client states is very little more equitable than that between the British, say, and the quarter or so of the Earth’s land surface that was occupied by British troops and exploited by British economic interests in the 19th century. Claims of racial superiority having fallen out of fashion, the industrial nations nowadays justify their position by claiming that their political and economic institutions are superior, and the rest of the world’s nations can share exactly the same lifestyles of abundance if they only adopt these.<br><br>Today’s industrial societies treat this claim as a self-evident truth. Of course the colonial powers of the 19th century treated the claim of European racial superiority as a self-evident truth, too, and the two claims are equally bogus. The abundance enjoyed by the world’s industrial nations just now, after all, is the result of the fact that those same industrial nations use the great majority of the world’s fossil fuel production. Given that the current industrial nations have burnt around half the planet’s fossil fuel resources themselves, leaving the remaining half to fuel themselves <i>and</i> the rest of the world in the future, dangling the carrot of industrial prosperity in the faces of Third World countries at this point in the historical process is dishonest at best.<br><br>Of course it does seem to be true that representative governments and corporate-capitalist economies are more efficient than the competition at turning abundant fossil fuels into suburban lifestyles. This does not make representative governments and corporate-capitalist economies the cause of the prosperity of today’s industrial nations, any more than the skin color of people from Europe was the cause of Europe’s ascendancy during its age of empire. Still, just as the unmentionable realities behind European imperialism made it inevitable that there would be attempts to justify it via bad science, the equally awkward realities behind the ascendancy of today’s industrial powers provide the push behind well-meaning attempts to package the industrial world’s institutions for export to the Third World.<br><br>The same sort of logic, on an even deeper level, governs the relationship between the nations of the modern industrial world and the foundation of those nations’ present prosperity – the Earth’s fossil fuel reserves themselves. The hard reality is that the minority of us who happened to have been born in a few powerful countries squandered half a billion years of stored photosynthesis to give ourselves a brief period of spectacular economic abundance, and by doing so, foreclosed the chance that anybody else would enjoy that same abundance in the future. Fossil fuels are not renewable resources in any time frame accessible to our species. Every barrel and ton and cubic foot of fossil fuel we use now is subtracted from the total available to our descendants; despite an orgy of handwaving, no other resource can provide anything approaching the glut of cheap abundant energy on which our lifestyles of relative privilege depend.<br><br>Yet this point of view is at least as unmentionable in polite society just now as were the gritty realities of European colonialism in its time, or the equally gritty facts underlying the ascendancy of the world’s industrial nations over the Third World today. The strenuous efforts to find a racial basis for European supremacy a century ago, and the equally vigorous efforts to hold up contemporary Western institutions as the key to prosperity and peace in the Third World today, thus have precise equivalents in the enthusiasm with which every imaginable alternative energy resource gets treated by government officials and media pundits throughout the industrial world.<br><br>None of these resources can actually provide the cheap abundant energy needed to maintain the kind of society we have today. I know that this is a controversial statement just now. Still, it’s worth noting that every alternative energy resource that’s actually been brought into production has turned out, at best, to provide a modest increment to existing energy supplies, and that only if you don’t keep track of the energy subsidy the new resource gets from fossil fuels. Of course technologies that haven’t been put into production look more promising, and the further they are from implementation, the more impressive they look; hype, often geared to the very practical goal of selling shares in IPOs, is at least as abundant in the energy field as anywhere else.<br><br>And this, dear reader, is where the gap between our society’s official respect for science and its real attitudes toward the world shows up with remarkable clarity.<br><br>Once again, the role of the B-movie heavy in this drama is played by the second law of thermodynamics, better known as the law of entropy. As mentioned in a previous post, this is the gold standard of physics, the law you can’t break without, as Sir Arthur Eddington put it, collapsing in deepest humiliation. Everybody in the industrial world with the least smattering of a scientific education knows about it, or at least was introduced to it, and yet next to nobody wants to talk about how it affects the emerging energy crisis of our time.<br><br>The crucial implication of the law of entropy, for our purposes, is that it’s not energy as such, but a <i>difference</i> in energy potential, that allows work to be done. Imagine two smooth round boulders of equal weight, one of them sitting on a flat plateau and the other sitting on the slope of a steep hill. If the two are at the same distance from the center of the Earth, gravitation gives them exactly the same amount of potential energy. Still, if you give the one on the plateau a push, you aren’t likely to do anything but strain your muscles, while if you give an equal push to the one on the slope, you may send it rolling down the hill, squashing everything in its path.<br><br>The difference is that every part of the plateau has the same energy potential due to gravity, while every part of the slope does <i>not</i> have the same potential, and the boulder rolling down the slope can cash in some of the difference in potential to keep itself moving. The greater the difference in potential, the greater the payoff in terms of energy released. Notice, though, what happens when the boulder on the slope finally lurches to a stop at the bottom of the valley below: it stops, and another push won’t get it going again. It still has a lot of potential energy in that position – it has, in theory, 4500 miles to fall until it reaches the center of the earth – but there’s nowhere it can go to release any of that energy. Without a difference in potential, how much energy you’ve got is a meaningless statistic. (This is, incidentally, why the quest for zero point energy is an exercise in absurdity; by definition, zero point energy is at the lowest possible potential state, and therefore cannot be made to do any work at all.)<br><br>The same rule applies to every energy resource: there has to be a difference in potential that allows energy to be released, and the bigger the difference, the bigger the benefit. With petroleum, the difference is in chemical energy. Those long chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms have a lot of energy to release when they come apart and combine with highly reactive oxygen instead; the short chains that form natural gas have less, and the carbon in coal has less still, though it’s still a lot by the standards of other energy sources. All the extraordinary things our species has done with fossil fuels over the last three hundred years are functions, in effect, of the difference in chemical potential energy between a barrel of oil and a cloud of smoke.<br><br>Why are these reflections as welcome in the collective conversation of our time as a slug in a fresh green salad? Because they point up the profoundly shortsighted nature of the decisions that made the world in which all of us now live. The immense potential energy locked up in fossil fuels was put there by millions of years of photosynthesis. It’s as though, to return to our metaphor, living things down through the ages rolled boulders uphill and perched them high above the valley floor. After a half billion years or so, our species came along, and figured out how to roll those boulders downhill. As long as there are still plenty of boulders in place, we can continue using them, but when the rate at which we want to send boulders rolling downhill outstrips the boulder supply, it’s a waste of breath to insist that we can get the same results by bouncing pebbles across the valley floor.<br><br>This is basically what the more enthusiastic proponents of alternative energy are saying. By the time sunlight gets to us, after traversing 93 million miles of empty space, it’s simply not that concentrated an energy source; that’s why it took the Earth’s photosynthetic organisms so many millions of years to build up the energy reserves we now squander so freely. Wind and hydroelectric power are both secondhand sunlight, the product of natural cycles driven by the sun; the same is true of every kind of biofuel, of course. Nuclear energy is the one nonsolar energy resource we’ve got, but it has severe problems and limitations of its own, not least the fact that the fossil fuel inputs needed to build, run, and decommission a nuclear reactor are so vast that there’s a real question whether nuclear power is a net energy source at all. (Of course the further a nuclear technology is from actual implementation, the better it looks, and the ones that are still vaporware look best of all.)<br><br>Does this mean alternative energy is a waste of time? Of course not. Modest as the energy outputs from alternative sources are, they’re what we’ll have to work with when the fossil fuel is gone. What it means, rather, is that the particular kind of civilization we’ve built in the last three centuries will not survive the end of cheap abundant fossil fuels. A society that is used to getting things done by rolling huge boulders down steep slopes is going to have to learn to make do on the much less lavish results of bouncing pebbles across the flat.<br><br>The problem here is that very few people want to deal with that reality. The great majority will make themselves believe in zero point energy and evil space lizards and any other absurdity you care to name, rather than gulp and take a deep breath and admit that the prosperity we’ve enjoyed for the last three centuries was bought at our grandchildren’s expense. I sometimes suspect that one of the reasons so many people like to imagine an apocalyptic end to the industrial age is that sudden extinction is easier to contemplate than the experience of slowly waking up to the full extent of our own collective stupidity.<br><br>And that, dear reader, is why entropy has become the Rodney Dangerfield of the contemporary energy debate. It may be the gold standard of physics, but in the collective conversation about our future, it don’t get no respect.<br><br>******************<br><br>I’m pleased to report that both the new projects mentioned in last week’s post are moving ahead. Readers who are following “Star’s Reach,” my online blog-novel about the world after peak oil, will want to know that a new episode has been posted at http://starsreach.blogspot.com.<br><br>The Cultural Conservers Foundation is also moving forward. Those interested in participating in a more focused discussion of the subject are invited to join me on a newly founded email list, cultural_conservers@yahoogroups.com. The list is moderated, and the same rules apply there as here – no spam, no flaming, no trolls, etc. The fast way to join is to send an email to cultural_conservers-subscribe@yahoogroups.com, with “subscribe” as the subject line.<br><br>The process of starting a nonprofit also takes a certain amount of cash; I’m putting my own money into it, but would welcome help with the startup costs. We were originally planning on using PayPal for donations, but PayPal policies make it impossible for a nonprofit to use their services until after tax exempt status has been obtained. Those interested in donating to help with startup costs may contact me offlist at info (at) aoda (dot) com. Many thanks in advance for your help!

Maybe I should add at this point that my work mainly deals of making models of ecosystem dynamics, so you can expect the other guy to now something about how nature works, even though he works in a slightly different field than I do. Anyway, we kept on talking for a while and I was under the impression that I got my point across since he kept on agreeing and giving reasonable responses that showed some sort of insight and understanding. But then after a short break he started talking about the new position he got offered and how he sees his career going on for the next decades and that hopefully everything turns out fine.<br><br>Your next to the last paragraph gives the impression that you think people are either ignorant or delusional. Here I would also offer the possibility that a lot of us are not able to comprehend the implications of collective actions, due to the "the world is always getting better" mantra ubiquitously being repeated by almost everybody and thereby taking its toll on the scope of scenarios our brains are able to accept and deal with. After working in science for now ten years, with the supposedly "smart people", I have come to the conclusion that our image of how intelligent we really are needs a major revision.<br><br><a href=entropy-gets-no-respect.html#c8182810558892365042 title="comment permalink">8/26/09, 11:54 PM</a><br><br>

The plateau analogy is great and even more applicable then may be seen at first. And here I'm thinking about zero point energy.<br><br>ZPE sounds as if it's packing not much of a punch; after all, it's nearly zero. Is it? It turns out that the "level" of ZPE is more like the plateau. Which for boulders was 4,500 miles from the centre of the Earth - similarly ZPE is also high, being somewhere in the region of 10^81 joules per cubic metre. But as you point out, that's pretty useless - if there is no other ground state (=if there is nothing "lower" to fall to) :(<br><br>But not all is lost. The zero ground state may NOT be a static value, like the static height of a plateau; right now it looks like vacuum energy is similar to a sea or atmosphere - there are dynamics and pressure gradients at space's foam scale. A device able to mimic a wind-turbine, but accessing foam-level space rather then wind - may be able to pick up some tiny part of energy. How do we build such a device - and how tiny is tiny? These are the unknowns.<br><br>Remember, there are people who claim to have done this. Are they frauds? How well would they be welcomed in our economic structure?<br><br><a href=entropy-gets-no-respect.html#c8912244398071337319 title="comment permalink">8/27/09, 4:26 AM</a><br><br>

How can we value what only our grandchildren (or not yet born descendents) will actually use or appreciate?<br><br>Unless we can get our heads around this and come up with some sort of solution, surely there will be an ugly coming to terms at some point in the future.<br><br>I'm going to resist commenting on the whole zero point energy thing as it disrupts the comments, but to be honest we have to at least admit the possibility that beings from other planets/dimensions/etc are visiting Earth and that they do (most likely) have technology which could clear up all these problems. The issue, of course, which is related to the above issue, is that they are unlikely to give it to us while our level of consciousness is still stuck in the same short term selfish groove.<br><br><a href=entropy-gets-no-respect.html#c3906859885949108182 title="comment permalink">8/27/09, 5:49 AM</a><br><br>

There's only so long you can paste "Live Simply That Others Might Simply Live" bumper stickers on your SUV -- and yes, I've seen this -- before the hypocrisy starts to wear badly. <br><br>Edde, I read Rifkin's book quite a while back, and recall having some sharp disagreements with it. I probably ought to revisit it -- thanks for the reminder!<br><br>Hardvark, I don't think its so much a matter of ignorance or delusion as what the existentialists call "bad faith." We know that what we're doing is a very bad idea, but the advantages to ignoring that fact are so immense and tangible that most of us deliberately close our eyes to the implications of our own actions. <br><br>Hardhead, I plan on doing something of that sort in the next few posts. <br><br>Disillusioned, nobody's yet demonstrated a working ZPE device in a public setting that precludes fraud. Until that changes, you might as well claim that the energy crisis can be solved by putting unicorns on treadmills. <br><br>Lake, I'll have to check my textbooks, but iirc the time frame for laying down an oil-bearing stratum of any size isn't all that short. Still, you're certainly right that the Earth's internal heat has a lot to do with the concentration process that makes fossil fuels so hugely valuable. <br><br>Dissident, please don't drag in imaginary extraterrestrials -- that's right up there with unicorns on treadmills. (On the off chance you're interested, I've written a book on the UFO phenomenon, somewhat unimaginatively titled <i>The UFO Phenomenon</i>, which surveys the last 60 years of funny things in the sky in some detail.) This claim that extraterrestrials could save us if we were better people, in particular, is simply a religious claim in science-fiction drag.<br><br><a href=entropy-gets-no-respect.html#c8801880766274818817 title="comment permalink">8/27/09, 7:02 AM</a><br><br>

The immediate needs are the filing fee to incorporate the foundation as a nonprofit (US$170), and the filing fee needed to register it as a tax-exempt organization (US$300).

The bio-system health issues on top of the potential weaponization of this material is a moral issue of the first magnitude.<br>Yet. On an EROI basis it is probably the best fuel source available today. The construction cost of nuclear plants, like the construction cost (cost in energy, materials, anything) of automobiles ends up being a small fraction of the energy lifetime of a power plant or a car. <br><br>I offer the above as helpful suggestions not as criticism.

One danger of confusing (or merely appearing to confuse) them, is that folks might then feel justified in inferring that much of the rest of what you say is also confused.

Do not feed the trolls.<br><br>npeters,<br>Entropy is simple, although it's not often explained simply. Any time you use energy, that is any time you move an object or substance from a state of high potential energy to a state of low potential energy, some of the energy is lost, usually as heat. Always. The percentage of the theoretical energy that is actually used to do work is referred to as the efficiency. If 40% of the energy is lost, the system is 60% efficient.<br><br>Automobiles are typically 35-40% efficient. This means that 60-65% of the energy in the gasoline is lost as heat.<br><br>That's it, entropy in a nutshell. Of course, there are implications to entropy that bother some.

As I was thinking of a brilliant <a href=http://www.theoildrum.com/node/4611/418278 rel=nofollow>quote adaption</a> by <a href=http://www.theoildrum.com/user/GreenEngineer rel=nofollow>GreenEngineer</a> at the time. The quote is "Any sufficiently advanced stupidity is indistinguishable from malice." which is a permutation of Arthur C. Clarke's "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic". The problem with the word stupidity is that there is not presently a robust theory of stupidity, which I freely admit sounds stupid. But it is an important distinction as most of the stupid decisions made in the world of politics are made by highly intelligent people. A good example is the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_affair rel=nofollow>trial of Galileo</a> where Galileo's accurate understanding of the movement of celestial bodies was condemned as heresy by a literate and well versed, seasoned and vetted, intelligent and motivated group of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_affair#Inquisition_examination rel=nofollow>qualifiers</a> for logical inconsistency with the established order and conventional wisdom of the time. So, stupidity in the sense that I would like to use it can not be defined as the opposite of intelligence which leaves me without an operable definition of stupidity in spite of the fact that everyone knows what I mean when using the word. I think that this is a linguistic nuance where dumb, stupid, and ignorant are technically accurate antonyms of smart, intelligent or educated they fail to account for well reasoned decisions made on faulty assumptions, lacking a broader vision, or willfully obtuse of important considerations. Foolish and unwise are much more accurate terms except that they fail to capture the deliberation and emotional punch that is required. A foolish, unwise, or ignorant person typically didn't think a situation through because they lack the capacity that wold make them smart, intelligent, or wise. The word I believe that I am looking for means very intelligent and deliberately unwise, sadly I don't know what that word is.<br><br><a href=entropy-gets-no-respect.html#c3441976497513670592 title="comment permalink">8/30/09, 12:23 PM</a><br><br>

However, the politicians in charge of enacting campaign finance reform realize that enacting the desired reform would deprive them of their corporate sponsors and hurt their chances of reelection. This results in a situation where the politician's political self interest is in direct conflict with the interests of their constituency.<br><br><a href=entropy-gets-no-respect.html#c6751659092560013195 title="comment permalink">8/30/09, 12:25 PM</a><br><br>

You serve aboard a ship and your country is at war. Your personal ambition is to rise in rank to captain, but there's a limited number of opportunities.

Your short-term or competitive goal is to outshine your rival so that you may obtain the next promotion. <br><br>To achieve your long-term goal, the best course of action is to serve to the best of your abilities and help your rival in whatever he undertakes, as every sailor doing his best is the most certain way to carry your nation to victory and also to deliver everyone on the ship through the war alive.<br><br>To achieve your short-term goal, the best course of action is to do your best at your own duties and to refuse to help your rival, to spread rumors in order to undermine his effectiveness, and to sow insubordination among his subordinates.<br><br>If you are like the lieutenant on my son's ship, you sabotage the work of your rival, see to it that (in this instance) the repairs made by his crew are undone, and physically interfere with the accomplishment of the ship's mission.<br><br>This is how the long-term interest and the short-term interest of a person can be in conflict.

In essence, such a scheme recognizes the intermittency of wind generation, but attempts to rectify the situation by utilizing precisely that electricity that is generated when the wind IS blowing. <br><br>This would seem to make wind generation even less efficient: assuming that you dedicate 50% of your average generation to 'pumped storage', your average overall annual generation will then be only 50% of an already low value. Worse, I imagine that the conversion of electricity back to potential energy will not be anywhere near 100% efficient, and that if you expend 1GW of electricity on 'storage', you'll get back a bit less when you use that 'stored potential energy'.<br><br>Anyone care to comment?

It's just a way of getting around the fact that those pesky customers don't always want the exact amount of electricity you can deliver. The choice isn't between delivering X amount of energy to a customer or to pumped storage; if the customer only wants some smaller amount Y, you either have to throttle back production or store the surplus somewhere. So you make X, deliver Y, and store X-Y. Then, some time later, when you can still generate X but the customer wants some larger amount Z, you can supplement X with the X-Y you saved earlier (less losses, of course - this is a post about entropy, after all!). This has been done profitably for quite some time now where geography has been appropriate to the task.<br><br><a href=entropy-gets-no-respect.html#c8674020215290373076 title="comment permalink">9/2/09, 12:27 PM</a><br><br>
