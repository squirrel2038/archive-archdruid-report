I owe, I think, an apology as well as a few words of explanation to the regular readers of this blog. The weeks I’ve taken off from posting here this summer have not been as innocent as they seemed, and those of you who may have imagined me basking in the mostly theoretical sun on some gray and rainy Oregon beach are about to be sadly disillusioned. Conspiracy fans take note: a plot has been afoot.<br><br>Over the last few weeks, my spouse and I have relocated to the other side of North America and are now settling into a new home in Cumberland, an old mill town of 20,000 people tucked away in the north-central Appalachians, up in the panhandle of western Maryland. The Amish country of Pennsylvania begins not that many miles north of us, and West Virginia’s a stone’s throw across the river to the south; the big cities of the east coast are only a few hours away by train, but you wouldn’t guess that from the rural ambience and the dense forest blanketing the hills. It’s a pleasant place, with old brick buildings and pretty scenery, and it’s becoming a regional hub for the arts, with the help of very low rents and the enthusiasm of the local arts council. Still, none of those are the primary reason why we moved here.<br><br>Readers of this blog who remember an earlier post, “Rethinking the Rust Belt,” may have already guessed at some of the deeper motives behind the move. Though it flowered earlier than most, Cumberland is a quintessential Rust Belt town. Founded in the 18th century along one of the most important transport routes linking the east coast to the interior, it became by turns a canal center, a railroad hub, and a thriving industrial town where factories powered first by water and then by local coal anchored an economy lively enough to make Cumberland the second largest city in Maryland. From its red brick factories and faux-medieval county courthouse to its distinctive local beers – Queen City Brewery was the big name here until it went under in the Seventies – it’s hard to think of a detail of the old American industrial heartland that wasn’t present and accounted for.<br><br>As America’s manufacturing economy ebbed, in turn, Cumberland suffered accordingly, and its population today is little more than half what it was forty years ago. Most of the old mansions on Washington Street have been subdivided, the once fabulously busy C&amp;O Canal that ran from here to Chesapeake Bay has not been used in many decades, the last factories closed long ago, and half a century of struggle for survival has left visible wounds across the city. The railroad still runs through the middle of town, and there’s daily passenger service west to Pittsburgh and east to Washington DC, but the splendid old station that once graced the town was torn down decades ago and replaced with a bleak little cinderblock building about the size of a suburban three-car garage. The tourist brochures call Cumberland scenic and friendly, and not without reason, but not even the most imaginative publicist would think of calling it prosperous.<br><br>The conventional wisdom these days holds that towns like Cumberland have a future only if they can find some way to catch the coattails of the booming (well, formerly booming) economies of the two coasts. Cumberland city boosters have done their level best to follow that lead in recent years, with tourism and the arts scene as focal points, and they’ve had modest success so far. If I’m right about the future of America and the rest of the industrial world, though, they might want to consider raising their sights a bit, because the tide of history that left Cumberland and so many towns like it high and dry may just be turning.<br><br>I don’t know how many readers of this blog remember, as I do, the headlines that came out of the Rust Belt in the 1970s, when the economic collapse of America’s industrial hinterland first really became visible on the large scale. Anyone who needs a refresher, though, can get one easily enough by reading the equivalent headlines coming right now out of California. The political gridlock, the sclerotic economy, the slumping quality-of-life indices, the special interests clinging to oversized shares of a shrinking pie – it’s all there, made all the more poignant by the anguished yelps of California politicians insisting that the rest of the country can’t just sit by and let the formerly Golden State finish circling the drain. (A hint to Sacramento might be in order here: state governments from Pennsylvania to Illinois tried that gambit repeatedly forty-odd years ago,and it didn’t work then, either.)<br><br>The underlying cause is essentially the same, too. The collapse of America’s industrial heartland into the Rust Belt was part of the price, as I’ve pointed out in previous posts, of the economic shift that turned America from an industrial economy that produced most of its own goods and services at home to a global power that imported most of its manufactured goods from overseas. Since so much of the resulting flood of products came from Asia, the great ports of the west coast boomed – for decades now, the Los Angeles-Long Beach complex has been the single busiest port in America – and the resulting flows of wealth turned the entire west coast from a mildly exotic region on the nation’s periphery to one of its core economic hubs. <br><br>Yet it’s only in the imaginations of believers in linear progress that such shifts are permanent. America is learning the hard way, as Britain did a century ago and Spain a century and a half before that, that the sheer economic burden of maintaining a global military presence is quite capable of pushing even the richest nation into bankruptcy. The Asian industrial powers that once churned out consumer goods for American stores are calmly retooling, using the billions we send them each year, to produce goods to meet the desires of their own newly prosperous people. Meanwhile the age of cheap abundant energy that made 20th century-style globalism possible in the first place is coming to an end around us. The economic model that built California’s past prosperity, in other words, is done enough to poke with a fork.<br><br>As far as I can tell, very few people on the west coast – or anywhere else – have begun to think through the implications of that troubling fact. I wonder, for example, how many states within driving range of California have drawn up plans to deal with the massive influx of economic refugees that will likely follow once California’s relatively lavish entitlement programs are slashed to the bone or shut down completely. I wonder whether any of the other west coast states, for that matter, have faced up to the possibility that the import-driven gravy train they’ve been riding for the last half century may just have run off the rails. If that’s the case – if Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland and Seattle play the same role in coming decades that towns such as Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Buffalo and Gary played in the recent past – some of the most basic assumptions of American social geography are headed for the dumpster.<br><br>Sussing out the geography of the future in advance is no easy task, but the constraints bearing down on what’s left of the American economy offer a few hints worth noting. Now that we’re on the downslope of Hubbert’s peak – world production of conventional petroleum peaked in 2005 – energy costs will, on average, take a larger bite out of economies around the world with each passing year. One of the implications is that transport costs will no longer be a negligible part of the cost of goods shipped over long distances. More energy-efficient transport modalities will tend to replace less efficient ones because they, and thus the goods they ship, will be more affordable; equally, diseconomies of distance will tend to outweigh economies of scale and foster the reemergence of regional economies. Among the likely beneficiaries of these changes are the towns that thrived best in an earlier, more regional economy -- those that are well served by rail and water transport, surrounded by farming regions that don’t depend on irrigation, not too far from major markets, and provided with ample and inexpensive real estate for the factories and warehouses of a downscaled and relocalizing industrial economy.<br><br>Welcome to the Rust Belt – and, among many other towns, to Cumberland. <br><br>Now of course our move here is a gamble, and a distinctly contrarian gamble at that. According to the conventional wisdom, we’re nuts. If the believers in perpetual progress are right, and America leaps out of the current Great Recession into some glossy future full of even higher high tech gimcracks than we have today, Sara and I have consigned ourselves to a dying economic backwater that will survive, if at all, only by whoring itself out to some futuristic tourist trade. If the believers in imminent apocalypse are right, equally, those starving mobs who are supposed to pour out of the big cities on cue to provide target practice for survivalists could very well head this way. Still, my guess is that neither of these very popular tropes about the future is at all likely to reflect what will actually happen – and in most other possible futures, including those I consider most likely, Cumberland and places like it are likely to do at least as well as anywhere else in this country, and quite probably better than most. One way or another, though, we’re betting on the Rust Belt.<br><br>*****<br><br>Over the last few weeks, while I’ve been packing and unpacking boxes and waiting to get my internet access up and running again, I’ve set some projects in motion. A couple of them may be of interest to this blog’s readers.<br><br>First, I finally have something to offer those of you who wrote hoping for more of my fictional explorations of the deindustrial future. I’ve begun work on an online novel titled <i>Star’s Reach</i>; you’ll find it just a click away at http://starsreach.blogspot.com. It’s set in Dark Age America about five hundred years from now; longtime readers will likely recognize the setting as the latter years of the salvage society phase I’ve discussed in past posts. I expect to add a new section to the tale every couple of weeks, but we’ll see.<br><br>Second, I’ve begun laying the groundwork for a nonprofit organization to help bring about what I’m convinced will be one of the most crucial initiatives of the next few decades. The Cultural Conservers Foundation will support the hard but vital work of preserving the legacies of the past and present into the future. It will be nonpartisan, nonpolitical, nondenominational, and as independent of any other source of unhelpful interference as I can manage. Expect further posts on this project as it comes together.

Whether Cumberland will meet all the sustainability requirements of the post-petroleum era, only time will tell, but I think you make a compelling case. Whether or not and when to relocate is a decision that many of us will have to make. In my case, the question is a bit more complicated because I also have to decide which country to relocate to (currently I'm living in Chile.) I've convinced my family that, at a minimum, very soon inter-continental airline travel will not be feasible for the bulk of humanity (I'd bet on 2012 and beyond). As a result, the biggest mental challenge for those of us who have taken international travel for granted is to come to grips with the fact that we need to choose wisely where we're going to live because in all likelihood it will be a place where we'll have to stay put for the rest of our lives.<br><br><a href=betting-on-rust-belt.html#c6081354895829873575 title="comment permalink">8/19/09, 4:59 PM</a><br><br>

That's seriously putting principles into action. Maybe I'm mistaken, but I detect a certain similarity to the location in Jim Kunstler's "World Made By Hand". But still, its sad in many ways to watch the decline of California from afar here in New Zealand. Whatever the reasons, it's never nice to see people suffer. <br><br>Thanks to your blog and philosophy, I often find myself asking similar questions about the best place to live in my own neck of the woods - New Zealand. We're blessed enough with a benign climate and good latitude range for any shifts, as well as a renewable electricity supply. But on the other hand, we have a road transport system completely reliant on largely imported fossil fuels and a government in deep denial. A few big unsustainable cities too... <br><br>Lots of challenges before we can create an ecotechnic future here, but it's a goal I intend to pursue.intet<br><br><a href=betting-on-rust-belt.html#c7740896023894508276 title="comment permalink">8/19/09, 5:23 PM</a><br><br>

But, we have models such as the cities you've mentioned...

I didn't see that one coming at all! Hey, we're almost sort of not-really-but kinda culturally neighbors now. At least we're now in regions with much more ecological similarity. <br><br>One major factor that landed us here (in middle TN) was the suitability of the landscape for non-irrigated agriculture as well. I figure even if the area reverts to subsistence poverty in the worst-case scenario, history has shown that this is in fact a sustainable process here. Plus, on beyond all the grander concerns, it is nice to have the possibility of taking charge of your own food chain and get your own drinking water to whatever extent you desire. <br><br>Change can happen fast in "rural backwaters;" when we moved here 7 years ago this was pretty much a conventional hillbilly town with dying industries and collapsing local retail; now there is a steady influx of greenies, three wineries have opened, the city and county councils have voted for designation as a transition town (whatever that means), an "eco-industrial park" has just opened (whatever that means), and the tech college is starting a "green business" curriculum (whatever that means). Not sure what I think of some of those initiatives, and in some ways I appreciate the hillbilly side of the culture more than the greenie side (I am extremely wary of "greenwashing), but I expect in the future something constructive will form itself out of the pieces. One of the wineries was founded by a traditional moonshining family that decided to "go legit" -- so cultural fusion is happening!<br><br>Anyway, welcome to Appalachia! Better get used to understanding the correct use of "you" versus "y'all" and make sure you learn the proper seasons for land fish, ramps, and sang.<br><br><a href=betting-on-rust-belt.html#c5307494154975443805 title="comment permalink">8/19/09, 7:09 PM</a><br><br>

Now's a good time to make some choices. <br><br>Archmage, the CCF will be using the internet extensively while it still exists, so input from the other side of the world would be welcome. <br><br>BrightSpark, I don't know enough about New Zealand to have an educated opinion, but there ought to be good options. <br><br>Fernwise, thanks for the welcome! <br><br>Mark, the goal of the foundation is to help put together networks and toolkits to assist people to preserve whatever <i>they</i> think is valuable. Nobody today knows what will or won't be useful in the deindustrial future, so the strategy of dissensus -- that is, encouraging people to chase their own visions rather than trying to force (and enforce) a uniform consensus -- is the logical way to go. <br><br>Laurie, thanks for the welcome, and the tip about the pies! <br><br>Rebecca, one of the other factors driving the move is that most of the membership of the Druid order I head is east of the Mississippi. (We've got more members in Tennessee than we have in California.) Here in western Maryland, I can get to most of our really active groups by train, and to events all over the east coast, midwest, and south the same way. It ought to be entertaining. <br><br>DIYer, nah, the Cumberland Gap is actually well south of us here. That name got spread about a bit. <br><br>Byzantium, thank you!<br><br>Bill, I'm hoping to have a chance to try a sip or two of moonshine before all the 'shiners start producing chardonnay instead. For that matter, I've been mulling over plans for a solar still -- though you'd probably have to call the product "sunshine" instead!

Name came to to America via the Duke of Cumberland.

Your comment about the continued future availability of maritime and other "slower" forms of global travel is well-taken. What I intended to say, but omitted, was that currently U.S. and other "first-world" ex-patriots take for granted that they can fly home in a moment's notice, whether it be it for vacation, work, a friend's wedding or the death of a loved, etc. When those options disappear and you realize that living 10,000 miles away means you will not be able to fly home for your father's funeral, for example, it concentrates the mind on what our true priorities are. I may be wrong but I suspect the post-petroleum world will lead many who have the economic means to permanently move back to their home countries.<br><br><a href=betting-on-rust-belt.html#c1027331193071369329 title="comment permalink">8/20/09, 4:54 AM</a><br><br>

I live here and think about these things on a daily basis. I have yet to come to an agreeable solution for myself and my family.<br><br>To start off, I should say we have many things going for us. Virtually all of our power is generated at hydroelectric dams which with proper maintenance are good for another century or two. People are generally tolerant and well-educated. The soil is fertile and the forests and streams are abundant in their produce.<br><br>That said, there are also many downsides in a world of declining energy supplies. Our agriculture is extremely dependent on irrigation. Essentially no rain falls after the 4th of July until almost the end of September. Any crop that ripens after mid July absolutely requires irrigation. Without irrigation, that pretty much limits commercial crops to grains (wheat, oats, barley) and early vegetable crops (peas, spring cabbage, lettuce). Because of our mild winters and wet springs, it is notoriously difficult to make decent hay on the west side of the Cascades. This year's crop was delayed until mid-July and is of breathtakingly bad quality. Without irrigation, most of the East side is frankly desert. On some of the higher tablelands, a good crop of wheat can readily be grown, and some 80% of the US lentil crop is grown without irrigation in the Palouse country, but that pretty much covers it.<br><br>Transportation is a serious difficulty, with no significant canals, and only one navigable river system. There are three rail lines in the entire region, the north-south main line from BC to California, one railroad over Stevens Pass NE of Seattle to Wenatchee and thence to Richland, and one line which follows the Columbia/Snake from Portland to Lewiston, ID. In the event of a lack of diesel fuel, it is almost impossible to get goods from any one place to any other except by muscle power. <br><br>The mountains of Southern Oregon are some of the most vertical and isolated terrain in the country. Once, when driving to visit family in California, I kept track of the ups and downs between Eugene and Red Bluff. It's the equivalent of driving over a mountain higher than Mt Shasta. And that's the GOOD road.<br><br>Ashland, for all it's charms, is a town that subsists on government expenditures, situated in the high desert in the middle of a forbidding mountain range. It has no industry, and little capacity to supply it's own needs for either goods or food.<br><br><a href=betting-on-rust-belt.html#c6978499437060806604 title="comment permalink">8/20/09, 9:38 AM</a><br><br>

That might have something to do with it. <br><br>Bill, the Duke of Cumberland was a popular guy in the late 18th century; it was only a century later that the Stuarts, whose attempts to reclaim the British throne he ended once and for all at Culloden, became romantic. Thus the profusion of Cumberland toponyms in America.<br><br>Hardhead, thank you for the welcome! <br><br>Karel, thank you also. I'll post more as details come together. <br><br>Gene, saw it!

You're dead on, of course, and it also may not help that the US dollar is likely to lose most or all of its value in the tolerably near future, leaving a great many of today's privileged ex-pats with very little of their current wealth. It could get very messy indeed. <br><br>Ponter, as I commented in my post, the whole west coast is dependent on an unsustainable import economy, and bids fair to turn into a new rust belt as that goes away.

A few reactions:<br><br>A thought: maybe you could put together a movement to put the old canal back in service, initially as a tourist draw, later evolving into a viable means of transportation.<br><br>The California you write about is mostly along the coast, in the large cities. A lot of the State is left out of that focus, and the dynamics are somewhat different. Not that the near future is going to be a picnic for Fresno, Bakersfield, San Bernardino, or the northern counties, but it may play out in different ways.<br><br>As for the coming economic decline based on the failure of globalization: at least we have some good exemplars in the rust belt cities, and might be able to learn from the experiences of Detroit, Pittsburgh, etc., and may even be able to avoid the worst consequences. (Somewhat related: check out <a href=http://www.guernicamag.com/features/1182/food_among_the_ruins/ rel=nofollow>Food Among the Ruins</a> for a look at the current state of Detroit and some attempts to create a new future for the place.)<br><br>I've subscribed to the RSS feed for Star's Reach -- looking forward to following it. (Another sudden thought: maybe start, in parallel, a few stories featuring the ancestors of the protagonist in this one, sort of filling in the gaps.)<br><br>Finally: <i>The Cultural Conservers Foundation will support the hard but vital work of preserving the legacies of the past and present into the future.</i> That got my attention! As you may remember, I've been collecting many of the comments from your CC posts, with the intention of doing a topical organization and starting what I'd envisioned to be a Wikipedia-like evolving knowledge base cum living document cum social network. Your announcement triggered me to pile together what I've got so far and put it <a href=http://dondwiggins.net/CultureConservation.html rel=nofollow>on a web page</a> where you can review it and decide what, if anything, you can make of it.

At some points along that highway, as you roll down the freeway in your diesel rig, you are paralleling the railroad tracks, and passing the historical markers indicating the route of the Oregon Trail. The same thing happens on I-80 when you slip through the Delaware Water Gap, following in the literal and metaphorical footsteps of many generations of westward-bound settlers and hundreds of years of freight.<br><br><a href=betting-on-rust-belt.html#c4316214629961272599 title="comment permalink">8/23/09, 5:21 AM</a><br><br>

Despite the fact I have your book, and have been reading your blog for three years now, you've remained an abstraction. A once-a-week-blog-writing abstraction, sure, but an abstraction. Cumberland, however, is the mid-point on my new route back to West Virginia to see my family, as my (new) wife and I just moved well outside of State College, PA so that she can go to school. My best friend, in fact, live in La Vale, MD, which is just around the bend from you. It wasn't until he moved there that I had ever thought of Cumberland as anything more than an oddly busy part of I-70. But, you're right, it has all manner of wonderful things going for it, especially if one counts proximity to West Virginia as a bonus, and as a native of the finest state in the Union, I surely do. <br><br>I don't know the town well, and have increasing odd pictures of it from the stories my friend and his wife (a high school teacher) tell me. The recent racial unrest at that school, for instance, which I understand made the national news. That's one thing that part of Maryland, and the corresponding West Virginia panhandle have been adjusting to in the last few years, an influx of people from the urban areas into what was traditionally much more rural. Cumberland, of course, hasn't been specifically rural in quite some time. Still, NEW people, whether they're a different color or a different socio-economic background in either direction, tend to stir things up a bit in Appalachia, and I've been interested to see how that all shakes out in your neck of the woods. It's not ALL arts councils and decaying buildings, in other words. <br><br>Welcome to Appalachia just the same. Always good to have a strong, reasoned voice in the area. Any lectures lined up at Frostburg State yet?<br><br><a href=betting-on-rust-belt.html#c2466111065794069143 title="comment permalink">8/23/09, 11:53 AM</a><br><br>

Best of luck on the Olympic Peninsula -- as a Seattle native who did a lot of hiking there, it's a place I love. <br><br>Amy, thanks for the welcome! I plan on looking into the possibility of events in Pittsburgh once things get a little less chaotic here. If you know of any likely prospects, please don't hesitate to let me know; an email to info (at) aoda (dot) org will get to me. <br><br>Dwig, things are already moving toward a reopening of the canal as a tourist draw -- a bunch of locks will have to be rebuilt, but one step at a time. There's also a local steam railway for the tourists, which means we've got people locally who know how to run and repair a steam locomotive -- not a small asset, that. <br><br>Bill, no question about that. One of the reasons I stressed transport as a near-term issue is precisely that so many people in the peak oil scene, having adopted the very sensible scheme of relocalization, forget that the hundred-mile diet is going to be an affectation or an ideological choice, and nothing more, for many years to come. <br><br>Burne, many thanks!

I do remain confident that my consciously chosen locale of Portland will survive the Long Descent better than most places on the west coast. <br><br>I am doing my part to make sure that happens. I continue my work on the Board of Directors of a non-profit called Growing Gardens that teaches low income people how to grow a portion of their own food. After taking the OSU Master Gardener courses, I do community outreach helping staff a gardening hotline for the Extension Service. I have a high profile media job in town and walk the talk of living without a car among my other efforts to educate those around me. <br><br>While you attest that trade affects much of the west coast economy, I also can see manufacturing jobs are returning here. Portland now is manufacturing the electric streetcars that ride not only on our streets-- but will soon in cities around the country. Gunderson makes rail cars here too. <br><br>We all must live consciously and be hyper aware of the consequences of life decisions we're making in this transition period that we're embarking upon.

The Druid Revival got under way in the 18th century -- it was in large part a reaction to the spiritual impact of the industrial revolution -- and it's had a presence here in MD since the early 19th century. But yes, I'll certainly be celebrating the holy days here. <br><br>Ekkar, I've noticed that those who talk of what's coming in terms of a purification by fire seem to think that they're flameproof. You might want to reconsider that assumption. The fall of a civilization is like a forest fire; it plays no favorites, and the fact that the forest may be healthier afterwards is probably not much consolation to those who get burnt to death. <br><br>Cat, no one choice is suitable for everybody, and if you're in a good position to deal with what's coming, excellent -- stick with it. <br><br>Karel, thank you!
