I opened last week’s post by pointing out that many people nowadays fail to grasp some of the most basic realities facing us as the industrial age comes to an end. That turned out to be a rich irony, for a great many of the comments I received in response to the post displayed a blind spot even bigger than the one I attempted to address. It’s a convenient irony, though, as it offers a useful way to start talking about an underexplored dimension of the predicament of our time.<br><br>The post in question pointed out that today’s much-hyped "information superhighway," far from being the wave of the future so many of its promoters claim it to be, was a temporary product of the last hurrah of the age of cheap energy and can't be expected to survive for long as that age winds down. Instead, as the economic burden of the internet's immense energy usage begins to bear down, other technologies less dependent on huge energy inputs will become more economical, driving a spiral in which rising costs and restricted access will cut into internet service while simpler technologies absorb a growing range of its current economic roles. Finally, when economic contraction and social disintegration have proceeded far enough, the internet will simply drop out of use altogether because the economic basis for its operation will have gone away.<br><br>Most of those who objected to this sketch of the future, in turn, relied on a very curious logic. The internet will remain viable and widely accessible, they claimed, because the economic advantages of keeping it are so great. Those few who addressed the issue of costs at all simply insisted that technological progress would allow the internet to use less power than it does at present, and left it at that. The same arguments, interestingly enough, were deployed in earlier discussions about railroad technology: most critics simply insisted that railroads were efficient and economically advantageous, while a few suggested that they could be run more efficiently than they are now. <br><br>All this is true, but it misses the central issue I've tried to raise in the last few posts – the impact of energy and resource scarcity on the relative costs and benefits of different technologies – and it also dismisses the even broader issue of whether such energy-intensive technologies are sustainable at all in the future ahead of us. It's a dizzying departure from reason to insist that the advantages conferred by the internet mean that the internet must continue to exist. The fact that something is an advantage does not guarantee that it is possible.<br><br>An example from one of the most famous cases of social collapse is relevant here. On Easter Island, as I think most people know by now, the native culture built a thriving society that got most of its food from deepwater fishing, using dugout canoes made from the once-plentiful trees of the island. As the population expanded, however, the demand for food expanded as well, requiring more canoes, along with many other things made of wood. Eventually the result was deforestation so extreme that all the tree species once found on the island went extinct. Without wood for canoes, deepwater food sources were out of reach, and Easter Island's society imploded in a terrible spiral of war, starvation, and cannibalism.<br><br>It's easy to see that nothing would have offered as great an economic advantage to the people of Easter Island as a permanent source of trees for deepwater fishing canoes. It's just as easy to see that once deforestation had gone far enough, nothing on Earth could have provided them with that advantage. Well before the final crisis arrived, the people of Easter Island – even if they had grasped the nature of the trap that had closed around them – would have faced a terrible choice: leave the last few big trees standing and starve today, or cut them down to make canoes and starve later on. All the less horrific options had already been foreclosed.<br><br>Further back in Easter Island's history, when it might still have been possible to work out a scheme to manage timber production sustainably and produce a steady supply of trees for canoes, this would have required harsh tradeoffs: one additional canoe per year, for example, might have required building or repairing one less house each year. Both the canoe and the house would have yielded significant economic advantage, but it wouldn't have been possible to get both. In a world of limited resources, in other words, it's not enough to insist that a given allocation of resources has economic advantages; you must also show that the same resources would not be better used in some other way or for some other need.<br><br>The survival of the internet in an age of dwindling energy supplies is subject to the same hard logic. The internet demands huge inputs of energy and resources. Those were easy to provide during the quarter century from 1980 to 2005, when the price of energy was artificially forced down to the lowest levels in human history, and the same glut of cheap energy made it possible to build and power the internet without impacting other sectors of the economy. As energy becomes scarce and costly in the not too distant future, on the other hand, the demands of the internet will begin to conflict with the demands of other economic sectors. The task of managing those conflicts will likely be the supreme economic challenge of the century ahead of us, not least because we are so utterly unused to thinking in terms of hard tradeoffs; we assume, blindly, that we can have it all.<br><br>Now it's true, of course, that the internet could be operated more efficiently than it is today. Efforts to increase efficiency, however, are subject to a law of diminishing returns; a range of limits ultimately rooted in thermodynamic laws put a ceiling on just how efficient any process can get. Such gains also have costs of their own; research and development does not come cheaply these days, nor does the construction and installation of more efficient equipment, and the budget cuts currently sweeping through companies and universities worldwide – themselves the harbingers of much greater cuts to come – do not exactly support the act of faith that claims infinite technological improvement as the answer to this and all other problems.<br><br>Nor is it valid to put the possibility of increased efficiency for the internet on one side of the balance and ignore the equivalent possibilities on the other side. After all, other technologies – some of which are already simpler and more efficient than the internet – are just as liable to see gains in efficiency as the internet. Even a more efficient internet is unlikely to be the most economical way to use the sharply constrained energy and resource flows of the deindustrializing future; if another technology or suite of technologies can provide something like the same services at a lower cost, that technology or suite of technologies will outcompete the internet. Thus if it costs less, all things considered, to send messages over shortwave radio, order products by mail from a catalog, and get pornography from a local adult bookstore, than to do the same things over the internet, then the internet will fall by the wayside, or at best will be propped up for noneconomic reasons as long as economic realities make it possible to do so.<br><br>It's crucial to remember that the entire supply chain that keeps the internet and its potential competitors running has to be factored into these calculations. It's easy to see the internet as uniquely efficient if all you take into account is the energy going into your home computer, or even if you consider the gigawatts used by server farms. Putting those gigawatts to work, however, requires an electrical grid spanning most of a continent, backed up by the immense inputs of coal and natural gas burnt to put electricity into the wires, and a network of supply chains that stretches from coal mines to power plants to the oil wells that provide diesel fuel for trains and excavation machines; the server farms draw on a vast array of supporting services and manufactures, from the overseas mines that produce rare earths for semiconductor doping through the factories that turn out components to the colleges that turn out trained technicians, and the list goes on. <br><br>All told, a fair fraction of the world's industrial economy helps support the internet in one way or another, and many of those support functions can't be done at all in a less centralized way or at a lower level of technology. Most of the potential replacements for the internet don't suffer from that limitation. It's entirely possible to build a shortwave radio by hand, for example, using components that can be built by hand from readily available materials; there are radio amateurs alive today who did precisely that before the postwar electronics boom made manufactured components cheap and easily accessible. In a world where the cost of energy is a major economic burden, these differences will matter, and give a massive economic advantage to less energy-intensive ways of accomplishing things.<br><br>One useful way to assess the vulnerability of any current technology in a world on the far side of Hubbert's peak, in fact, is to note the difference between the direct and indirect energy inputs needed to keep it working and the inputs needed for other, potentially competing technologies that can provide some form of the same goods or services. All other factors being equal, a technology that depends on large inputs of energy will be more vulnerable and less economically viable in an age of energy scarcity than a technology that depends on less, and the bigger the disparity in energy use, the greater the economic difference. In turn, communities, businesses, and nations that choose less vulnerable and more economical options will prosper at the expense of those that do not, leading to a generalization of the more economical technology. It really is as simple as that.<br><br>You might think that this sort of economic analysis would be an obvious and uncontroversial part of peak oil planning. Of course it's nothing of the kind. Most discussion and planning around the subject of peak oil these days pays no more than lip service to economics, if it deals with that dimension at all, and a great many of the plans being circulated these days look very appealing until you do the math and discover that the most basic questions about resource inputs and economic outputs haven't been addressed.<br><br>Now part of this blindness to the economic dimension is hardwired into contemporary culture. It hardly needed the mass exodus into delusion that drove the recent real estate bubble to prove that most people in the industrial world nowadays think that getting something for nothing is a perfectly reasonable expectation. We have lived with such abundance for so long that a great many of us seem to have lost any sense that there are limits we can't borrow or bluster our way around. To a very great extent, indeed, the last three hundred years of economic expansion have been driven by a borrowing binge even more colossal, and ultimately more catastrophic, than the one imploding around us right now. Instead of borrowing from banks, we borrowed from the Earth's stockpile of fossil carbon, and squandered most of our borrowings on vaster equivalents of the salad shooters and granite countertops that absorbed so much fictitious value during the late boom. By the time Nature's collection agencies get through with us, in turn, they may just have repossessed everything we bought with our borrowings – which is to say nearly everything we've built over the last three centuries.<br><br>Yet there's another source feeding into this blindness, because the theories of economics that have been used to try to make sense of the flows of natural and manufactured wealth in our societies are hopelessly inadequate to the task. It's difficult to construct a meaningful economic analysis of the future within a paradigm that insists that resources magically appear whenever there's money to pay for them, for example, or claims that damage inflicted by human economic activities on the natural systems that allow our economy to function in the first place are "externalities" that need not be considered in cost-benefit analyses. Current economic theory commits both these howlers, and others as well.<br><br>With next week's post, we'll begin a more detailed exploration of what an economic vision relevant to a deindustrializing future might look like. That exploration will start from the work of E.F. Schumacher, who was one of the most thoughtful (and heretical) economists of the last century, as well as an early (and rarely remembered) peak oil theorist. Using his ideas as a springboard, I hope to take today's discourse about the future of industrial society into unexplored territory, and – not incidentally – provide some unexpected but practical tools for coping with the arrival of the deindustrial age.

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c7396455783422235081></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/11090229434419954064 rel=nofollow>nutchanoot</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Thank you John for another insightful post. I read your column every week, but I get the feeling lately that most people simply can't relate to the history lessons you give. Your comparison between today's problems and those faced by the Easter Islander's is prescient, but I still fear it is too removed from life today for most people to grasp. After all, we have technology and they were just primitives. What could we possibly learn from those subcretans? I would like to offer something a little closer to home that might get people to understand the economics of decline. <br><br>I am from Thailand, and last year during the runup in commodities an incident occurred that made me understand exactly how vulnerable this infrastructure is, and why it is guaranteed to crumble. An article appeared in the paper where several large electrical transmission towers had collapsed, and investigations revealed that 6 of the 8 large bolts holding up the tower had been stolen for scrap. The transmission line was repaired at a cost of about $300K USD, and redundancy rendered the event unnoticeable to most, but it is a harbinger of things to come.<br><br>The bad news is, as the economy fades, the poor and hungry will resort to theft in order to feed themselves, and a good portion of that theft will be from our existing infrastructure. The first reaction will be what we have already seen. The government will pass laws to make scrap recycling more difficult, hopefully pushing these people towards softer targets. But as the crisis gets worse, destruction of infrastructure through theft will return. Markets will arise to work around the laws. More electrical transmission towers will collapse. In the beginning, they will be quickly repaired. As the years go by however, it will take longer and longer to fix. Sometime in the future, the unthinkable will happen. A village will go offline, and stay that way. There won't be sufficient justification to fix the problem. This will become more and more commonplace as theft of vital infrastructure spirals out of control. No country in the world will be immune to this.<br><br>There will be attempts to guard vital utilities either with the military or private security firms, but this will cause the price to rise to the point where people can not pay for it anymore. Eventually, this solution will be abandoned for economic reasons, and the electrical grid and utilities will contract to service only the most populated cities where economics makes this infrastructure viable. <br><br>The same problem applies to long distance railroads. It is hard to steal a waterway and sell it for scrap, but stealing a few spikes and bolts from the rail lines is relatively easy. Enough people doing this render the railroad useless, and even armed guards can only do so much.<br><br>And this is where people seem to miss the point. All of today's communication fiber runs along rights of way for either public utilities or railroads. Once these critical infrastructure components begin to shut down due to rampant theft and vandalism, so do the fiber links that make the internet. Satellite links will keep things functioning for a while, but at extreme cost. <br><br>The problem is not that the efficiency of these technologies can not be increased. Of course they can. The problem is that security for these infrastructure components is currently subsidized by the relative prosperity of our society and the narrative of progress that we collectively believe. Security will break down long before any other aspects play a part in our collapse. We allow this infrastructure to continue unmolested because we think it will help us get our share of the economic pie down the road. Once this belief is shattered due to rising prices and events outside of our control, this subsidy will be removed, and the price of basic utilities will rise beyond our ability to pay.<br><br><a href=economics-of-decline.html#c7396455783422235081 title="comment permalink">5/20/09, 6:32 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avtb a_61c74c" id=c1570288734597980916></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/02333438671130100114 rel=nofollow>Bill Pulliam</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Another way that I think about this, which is really just different terminology for the same concepts you have presented, is the economics of affluence. So much of the nature of the Internet right now had been shaped by the forces of affluence. The predominant activities on it are shopping and entertainment, and especially shopping as entertainment. Not long ago, not even two short decades, the internet was not seen as an economic activity at all. When I first got online from a .edu domain, we were all .edu, .mil, or .gov. Dot-com was considered sleazy, low-class, the home of trolls and annoying newbies. In the waves of affluenza that followed it was then transformed into hyper-TV, the greatest commercial mass medium of all time. I think this pretty well tells you what it's fate will be. It is a child of affluence. Affluence will not long survive the post-peak world that an increasing number of mainstream analysts are beginning to accept we have already entered. Ergo the internet as we now know it, child of affluence, affluenza incarnate, will not survive either. You can apply the same test to any other socioeconomic phenomenon or entity. Did it appear as a side effect of affluence, or does it require lots of surplus wealth to maintain it? Then prepare to watch it fade away. Some examples:<br><br>Neoconservative Ideology? A gonner. State-supported universal health care (doesn't exist here, of course, but in many other "developed nations")? Forget about it. Home gardening and brewing? Here for the long haul. Small inexpensive fuel-efficient means of transportation? They'll persist for a good while yet. Cell phones? Not a chance. $30,000 hybrid automobiles? Headed for the museum. Museums? Ever changing, but they'll always be with us. Art, literature, theater, music? You betcha. Global mass media? Adios. And so on. It's an easy game, but an illustrative one.<br><br><a href=economics-of-decline.html#c1570288734597980916 title="comment permalink">5/20/09, 6:58 PM</a><br><br>

Great thanks, JM Greer.<br>I hope that more readers would already understand the necessity of getting The Long Descent book and re-visit the difference between screen gazing and page turning experience. <br>Having lived part of my live in communist time (Czechoslovakia), I would dare to predict that the future economics (20 years plus) would operate on 2 very distinctive modes: <br>- Bare necessities (water, food, some energy, one set of clothing for many years, basic DIY tools)<br>These will be very likely regulated and have limited availability as long as some social order is kept. <br>- Luxuries. Craved, envied, unregulated, sometimes suppressed and basis for black market.<br>The point about luxuries is that they are vulnerable, difficult to keep but very rewarding in the long run. Any Cuban owner of vintage car (to cite just one example) knows this.<br> So I guess the ownership, service and production skills for these luxuries might be important part of future economics and one’s best hopes for relative prosperity (and not least, prestige symbols for next generation).

This makes sense because although data centres use a lot of electricity they have millions of users each. <br><br>A lot can be saved from the figure for PCs, for instance using laptop like chips rather than the more powerful but more power-hungry desktop chips, and switching the computer to standby or off when not in use. <br><br>However there are blind spots in this analysis. There is nothing said about the energy cost embodied in the manufacture of a computer. <br><br>A simple Google search reveals a figure of 6400MJ and 260kg of fossil fuel for the manufacture of a PC and monitor.<br><br>Assuming the computer uses an average of 100W in use, the energy cost of manufacture is equivalent to about 18000 hours of use. If you use your PC 6 hours a day, that's 3000 days use or about 8 years. <br><br>So to an order of magnitude the PC uses at least as much energy being made as it does in its lifetime. <br><br>I would say we have to double the cost of the internet to account for the energy used to manufacture and maintain the infrasrtucture. <br><br>So about 20% of US energy use and 10% worldwide.<br><br>Also we have to consider the economics. Microprocessor manufacturing for the masses is dependent on people discarding their computers before they actually reach the end of their lives. <br><br>If due to harsher economic circumstances people decide they don't really need a new PC to play the latest games etc., people will use their PCs until they break, fewer people will buy new computers, which will make it harder for microprocessor manufacturers. <br><br>They will also be hit by rising costs of inputs which will make microprocessors more expensive. <br><br>I assume it would be technically possible for someone to build a PC which although not very fast would still suffice for text based internet, but would use very little energy and last for many years, but there's no economic incentive to do so. Perhaps the government could have a few million of these made for public library terminals.<br><br><a href=economics-of-decline.html#c8344966929524263444 title="comment permalink">5/21/09, 1:51 AM</a><br><br>

The reason I say this is because your address concepts called EROEI and Net Energy (which you are probably familiar with).<br><br>Energy Returned on Energy Invested is the most important measure of what we can expect will happen in the near future. While we head down Hubbert's curve we have to spend increasing amounts of resources to extract energy from the ground to power our infrastructure and energy industry. As we obtain less and less energy for every unit of energy invested our Net Energy availible to society will reach zero. <br><br>What most experts in the peak oil scene assume is that going downhill will be the same as as going uphill. They expect a perfect "bell-shaped curve". However, all the predictions about the future are based on the economic and energy truths from the past. High EROEI and Net Energy. <br><br>What I expect is a scenario where we will reach negative EROEI and zero Net Energy somewhere halfway down Hubbert's curve. This will happen because we have high fixed costs in maintaining our current infrastructure. When we spend the resources on the infrastructure that is needed to supply us with these scarce resources we can't spend them on let's say, energy transition. <br><br>My point is, the current consensus that sliding down Hubbert's curve will be the same as the climb to the peak misses one major aspect. Economic and energy realities change when the peak is reached. This will probably translate to a situation worse than what we have been expecting to happen. <br><br>I'm not sure if you think it is relevant or not, but I would be very interested to hear your view on this concept and it's role in the deindustrialization of society.<br><br><a href=economics-of-decline.html#c2487324364024365570 title="comment permalink">5/21/09, 2:14 AM</a><br><br>

Modern cognitive/rational therapies remove 'neurosis' by subjecting such internal falsehoods to logical refutation, over and over again. One of the three 'basic irrational beliefs' of the neurotic, according to Albert Ellis, is:<br><br><i>"The conditions under which I live absolutely MUST, at practically all times, be favorable, safe, hassle-free, and quickly and easily enjoyable, and if they are not that way it's awful and horrible and I can't bear it. I can't ever enjoy myself at all. My life is impossible and hardly worth living."</i>... and it's worth bearing in mind that therapies which simply refute such beliefs by means of reason are scientifically <i>proven</i> to remove neurosis! These kinds of beliefs actually make people ill, and it's that illness upon which our 'economy' is predicated.

I've been thinking a lot about the Internet lately in a post-collapse situation. I think its existence or lack of existence will make all the difference between a potentially sustainable and healthy society or going back to the middle ages. Internet is a great tool for education, communication and information. If the Internet goes down, then it's bye-bye to all concerted action and power to the people. <br><br>Speaking for myself: Internet has done two things for me. It has provided me with information that has blown my mind. I've always been an avid reader and spent much of my time in university reading classic literature - which is always a good start IMO for self-development - but it wasn't until I got my first computer (I never wanted one, preferring Tolstoy, Forster and Huxley ;), but had to because of a new job) that the ball really started rolling. Especially when I started downloading all kinds of documentaries and reading blogs like this one. Without the Internet it would have taken many decades to get to this level of relative insight.<br><br>The other thing Internet has given me is an information addiction, which I'm not too happy with. That's the downside.<br><br>One of the biggest problems, besides energy of course, with computers is the manufacture of hardware. All of that has moved to Asia. A high level of centralisation is needed of course, but the current situation is extreme.<br><br>Combine this with the fact that computer manufacturers try to make you buy new a computer asap, and here's what you get: I currently live in Germany. When I buy a computer it is shipped from China to Germany (sometimes via the USA). When after 3-4 years I need a new computer to be able to play ultrahighqualitydefinition content (they could've stopped after the introduction of DVD as far as I'm concerned) my computer goes through a shredder at the dump. Yes, lots of times computers get shredded completely without taking parts out that still function. They put them in containers and ship them back all the way to Asia, where children can pry out all the precious metals with their little fingers.<br><br>I have tried for a while to develop sustainable computers by making them 50%-75% more power efficient compared to standard Dell or HP PCs. I've even designed low power systems in wooden casings to at least eliminate 10 pounds of metal and plastics that has to be shipped from Asia to Europe. This however doubled prices, so almost no one will buy them. A 50 year old carpenter in Europe simply costs 20 times more than a Chinese wage slave.<br><br>So coupled to the problem of the energy squandering nature of the Internet, you have this really nasty world of IT manufacturing that is almost impossible to change.<br><br>I think the world wide web will disappear eventually, but forms of regional networks will probably keep existing. In this case it could take the place of 'fair or festival' that Jeff Vail mentioned in his Problem of Growth-series. Anyway, in my vision of a sustainable society there has to be some form of independent source of information, communication and education. Without this a society will always fall back to violence, herd mentality, power struggles and unsustainable practices that lead to collapse and natural catastrophes.<br><br>I very much look forward to your 'more detailed exploration of what an economic vision relevant to a deindustrializing future might look like.' Without the Internet I wouldn't have been able to read what you write.

I am curious as to what the discoveries made during the 70's with progressive rock, and later metal, might lead to in terms of acoustic music, when most musicians will have reverted to acoustic instruments.<br><br> Another question : if you had to recommand a field of studies for a young woman or man about to enter the university, would you rather recommand getting an applied degree in solar energy or radio telecommunications ? Right now are there professional prospects for radio telecom experts ?

I think ours is the first, though, to convince itself that its rehashes are cutting edge stuff. <br><br>Medved, that's a plausible analysis. I'd especially focus on the skills needed to build and/or repair the luxury goods. <br><br>Llewellyn, bingo -- research and development, like everything else, are subject to the laws of diminishing returns; the more you've done, the more it costs you to go the next step. <br><br>Maw Kernewek, meur ras for the figures, which are pretty close to the estimates I've seen. I don't think you'll see governments putting money into hypercheap computers, though -- they're going to have many more urgent draws on their funds. <br><br>Kevin, put your work online if you like, but make sure it's available in printed form as well.

Jared Diamond has made an excellent case, though, that it was the loss of access to deepwater food sources that caused things to get so bad there. <br><br>Neven, for heaven's sake, the internet isn't the only option. Have you forgotten about print media? Not that long ago, my essays would have appeared in a magazine or a weekly, and we'd be having these conversations on the letters to the editor page. The internet displaced a very large and thriving world of magazines, newspapers, newsletters and the like, which can be kept going with very simple technology. <br><br>Jean-Vivien, it's anybody's guess whether amplified music will survive; the technology's simple enough -- many amps today use tubes -- but the investment may not be considered worthwhile. As for what I'd recommend for a young person, if they can go to college without going into debt, a degree in agronomy with a focus on organic methods, or an engineering degree in any of a dozen fields, would be good choices; if going into debt is the only option, I'd encourage them to stay away from college and learn one or more useful crafts on their own, or through apprenticeship with an experienced craftsperson. <br><br>Professor, you're welcome. <br><br>Peter, exactly. Most people don't even begin to grasp the immensity of the energy and resource inputs needed to make a microprocessor. <br><br>DIYer, yes, salvage and jerry-rigging are likely to be the wave of the future. <br><br>Farm, fair enough; now what do you propose to do about it? <br><br>Publius, excellent! If you can find a couple of old (1950s-era) electronics textbooks, those will be a major help; they give a lot more information than their newer and glossier equivalents. As for neofascism, it doesn't seem likely to me; authoritarian government, almost certainly, but fascism was a very specific phenomenon -- a point that's been badly obscured by the use of the term as an all-purpose invective -- and the conditions for its reemergence as a major force seem unlikely to emerge within the relevant window of time.<br><br><a href=economics-of-decline.html#c1399369833435998770 title="comment permalink">5/21/09, 9:42 AM</a><br><br>

Right now we have a psychology which is based on several centuries of a growing industrial economy. <br><br>Once decline sets in, we are into uncharted territory. I think it is almost impossible to predict what will happen to people psychologically. <br><br>However, it is not completely unknown for a society in modern times to experience a sustained economic contraction.<br><br>One of the worst economic contractions in modern times took place in the former Soviet Union. In Russia from 1989-98, the economy shrank by about 45%. <br><br>A few people got very rich as a result of the changes, so we can assume that the average person's income declined by more still. <br><br>What psychological changes have occured in the Russian psyche as a result of this experience? <br><br>Perhaps not a lot, since the Russian people have experienced disaster many times in the past century with repeated crises including the First World War, revolution, civil war, the purges, the Second World War. <br><br>The psychological impact on Western (particularly American) people today would be more of a shock still. <br><br>There are both similarities and differences between the situation in the former Soviet Union and Peak Oil. <br><br>Both involve a fairly sustained economic contraction where living standards decline for the average person for a number of years. <br><br>Both also involve a major restructuring of the economy, in the Soviet case from a centrally planned economy to a "free-market" one, in the Peak Oil case, from a growing fossil fuel dependent economy to a steady state sustainable one based on renewable energy. <br><br>However would it be psychologically important that with the case of Peak Oil the decline is permament?<br><br>I would imagine that government propaganda will present the crisis as a temporary recession, which will in the fullness of time revert to growth. It may take some time for people to actually realise that growth will never return, since there may well be periods where growth returns temporarily. <br><br>So the question is: Will we be able to manage the transition to a sustainable economy smoothly, or will we fail to adapt, and overshoot on the downside as our economy and society collapses? <br><br>I think a certain amount of overshoot on the downside is inevitable at this stage. I say this because I think human psychology will be too slow to change (we really should have done so about 30 years ago)<br><br><a href=economics-of-decline.html#c6475594705362378973 title="comment permalink">5/21/09, 10:48 AM</a><br><br>

I have been a regular reader for a couple of years now and I always look forward to your thoughtful and thought provoking weekly writings as one of the rare treats amidst all the cultural static with which we are surrounded.<br><br>As one or two others have commented, I too think the 'net will be around for a while yet. There is a lot of room for power consumption to fall and for decentralization to replace failed central control. When Wimax chips are ten a penny (soon now) the hardware will be available for a non-hierarchically managed 'net to evolve which could be run by amateurs and enthusiasts, as the net originally was in the beginning. <br><br>Even when production of new computers fails, much of the old stock of pentium 1,2 and 3 machines are still kicking around in peoples attics in service worthy condition. Cyber-cafes, rather forgotton in the west but still big in China, Bangladesh, India etc allow a single computer and a single net connection to serve 100 people a day who just want to check their email. Why assume that every user MUST have their own power hungry machine ? <br><br>At some point the 'net will fall but I reckon a lot of other stuff will go first. <br><br>Text based services like email, blogs etc are still the killer apps which make the net the marvel it is and even if global data capacity falls to 5% of its current capacity that would be enough to keep the emails, blogs and other regular text based services alive. Downloadable movies are a frill, the reson-detre of net is still text based.<br><br>Anyway, time will speak !<br><br><a href=economics-of-decline.html#c938143292665693691 title="comment permalink">5/21/09, 12:07 PM</a><br><br>

Yes, this is the kind of poverty we're facing. <br><br>Danogenes, you've made exactly the argument I've already critiqued -- "the internet is so useful, and we can run it with less power." So? A society scrambling to meet basic needs may have priorities other than maintaining free access to chatrooms and online pornography.

Do all letters to the editor page get printed? What if there are urgent matters to discuss such as Peak X?<br><br>Like I said in my first comment: Internet speeded up my development considerably. There are things I would never have grasped if Internet wouldn't have made it so easy for me to look for knowledge myself, read up on other people's opinions etc. The mainstream media didn't do that for me, and libraries or magazines didn't do it as fast. I don't mean to imply that fast is fantastic, but with things heading the way they are globally there's not much time for reinventing the wheel myself either.<br><br>I believe this to be the major positive influence of Internet, and print media can't replace that: It enables people to find the information or knowledge they want to know about, without being dependent on just one provider, and share it with others. <br><br>I know chances of it coming about are slim at best, but in my opinion a sustainable society would be built on three pillars: Decentralisation, transparency and self-sufficiency. If these criteria are not met, then a society isn't sustainable. I believe a medium like Internet is indispensable to meet these criteria. It enhances decentralisation, as any network does. It enhances transparency, on the condition that it's a free Internet (that's another subject entirely). And it enhances self-sufficiency, in that it provides people with an easy way to find information and communicate with each other. Without Internet decentralisation and transparency would be very hard if not impossible to achieve (especially if it has to be achieved relatively fast), and the same goes to a lesser extent for self-sufficiency.<br><br>In my view a sustainable society would be exactly like it is described on blogs like these, ie a society that has almost entirely powered down where people need to be much more self-reliant and self-providing than they are now. A society much more agricultural than urban in nature, BUT with some form of Internet for the reasons I mention above. A combination of low- and high-tech.<br><br>If there is absolutely no chance of a sustainable society coming about, then what is the point of discussing the things that are being discussed here? Without something like the Internet (and I don't think print media can cut it as a replacement) I believe that humankind as a species will disappear altogether. Not because people will have it more difficult, what with subsistence farming and medical care as good as gone, but because of the coup de grace in the form of climate change. <br><br>If everything falls apart, entire nations get ravaged by resource wars and social upheaval, a die-off takes place, and after all of that there is no fast and easy way left to transfer information and for people to come to some form of concerted action, then the warming of 4-6 degrees Celsius by 2100 will be the deathblow.<br><br>Without climate change I would've said: Fine, let's revert to print media or some other simple technology, we'll have plenty of time for that.

Our food systems, our economic systems, our energy and transport systems, our medical systems... too many people, too much complexity, too much fraud and waste, too much cost, too much interdependence (which is great when things run perfectly, but perfectly awful when they don't...) Even things that we see as absolutely essential (like foodstuffs) under our normal supply system <b>WILL GO AWAY if they are no longer considered profitable.</b> <br><br>That's the way the so-called modern "Free Market" works.

Civilizations decline in a stairstep fashion, as crises give rise to homeostatic responses, which are in turn overwhelmed by further crisis; repeat as needed until your civilization is a collection of mossy ruins. <br><br>The current volatility in the energy market is one way that pattern's expressing itself in the present example; I expect another drastic spike in oil prices this year, followed by another crash, and so on. The big question is whether the overall trendline stays level or goes upwards. My guess is the latter, but if the linkage between oil prices and the health of the economy is tighter than I think, it could stay flat and drive massive deflation. <br><br>DIYer, of course a simple network can be patched together, especially using packet radio (which I've been advocating here for more than a year) -- and that's probably a good transitional step. It's in the longer term that something simpler will almost certainly win out. <br><br>Maw Kernewek, paper can be made from scrap fiber in your kitchen using 15th century technology; it requires no fossil fuels at all. A printing press is a bit more complex, but again, 15th century technology will do it and fossil fuels need not apply. In a world struggling with energy scarcity, it's no contest. <br><br>Geoff, thank you. I dislike losing my temper, even -- or especially -- when goaded. But you're quite right that it's not exactly an easy way to start a conversation to walk up to a medieval peasant and try to tell him that God and the saints aren't there any more. <br><br>Kevin, thank you also. Mind you, I hope you're continuing to add salt to helpings of peak oil news and opinions, mine as much as anyone's; nobody's infallible in this business. <br><br>Shiner, you're probably right that that's a good part of it. Still, mulling all this over, I've realized that there's another factor in play: we as a culture have pretty much completely forgotten the meaning of the words "we can't afford that." A society awash in cheap credit and the "buy now, pay later" mentality doesn't exactly encourage people to learn how to make tough choices between priorities. The problem, of course, is that the credit economy is ultimately a social fiction; the real world, the world of nature, demands cash up front. <br><br>Zapoteca, I'm always saddened when people who have mastered the difficult and vastly important arts of raising children and caring for a home get convinced by our society that those skills aren't worth mentioning. Knowing how to cook a meal, run a household, and take care of people who need it are a good deal more useful than most of the things people have been spending their time doing for the last century or so. <br><br>Definitely look for that place in the Appalachians, but I wouldn't worry about heavy farming; there'll be an exchange economy going for quite a while yet, and it's not that hard to pick up a craft or two that will keep you stocked with anything your garden and henhouse won't provide.<br><br><a href=economics-of-decline.html#c146549402813776342 title="comment permalink">5/21/09, 9:37 PM</a><br><br>

Receivers are easy, it's the transmitters which use that kind of technology which use lots and lots of power, like between 50,000 watts ERP and 500,000 watts ERP. Plus you get to listen to shortwave fading in and out and bursts of static... sometimes all you'd hear would be CW. Most mesh networks use not more than 1 watt ERP per transmitter, you can get that kind of power from a small solar cell and a six-volt battery.

And boy, will it be a shocking territory. Anyone dependent on stock markets, government stimulations, trade across the world or latest electronic toys will be awfully disappointed. But what territory we are now in?<br><br>Last week I cited a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=IE&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;v=KHGcvj3JiGA" rel=nofollow>video lecture</a>, where it was explained (at 20-25 min mark) that the industrial revolution lead first to a control crisis (of growing production and distribution networks) that lead to firm dominance of corporations, and then to the crisis of superfluous production (that lead to the aggressive rise of advertisement). I can add <a href=http://www.storyofstuff.com/ rel=nofollow>one more video</a>; at around 12 min mark you can read there the following citation of apost-WWII policy maker:<br><br><i>Our enormously productive economy <b>demands</b> that we make consumption our way of life, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek our spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption... We need things consumed, burned up, replaced and discarded at an ever-accelerating rate. </i>Think about it. All this modern consumption craziness is based not on some irresistible forces of human nature. It is brought by a determined effort and “hard work” of a small industrialist-corporate-financial circle. How concentrated, coordinated and influential are the industrial interests, really? Their unilateral success of imposing the life style of destructive consumption as “the best and only choice” is truly impressive. I can’t speculate much about emergent or mindful insights of the select Davos or perhaps Illumnati clubs, but I can imagine that some big shots see the world population as one big tribe that they can control with a handful of economic and “spiritual” shamans.<br><br>It doesn’t take much brain to realize (or at least to conjecture) that the civilization is a few steps away from the abyss of resource limitations, and that we were approaching the abyss exceptionally fast lately. But this realization does not mean that you have to stage your own Cassandra mission. From a comparative perspective, it seems smart to keep your insight private, even confuse public perceptions, and prepare for the change of times at the expense of regular fools. The modern economic model (so dependent on ever new expansions) won’t make much sense in a contracting, fragmenting world. The only recognizable aspects in the new economy will be monopoly powers and rental claims - so the economy will go back to the times before Adam Smith.

However IT runs on electricity, and (at least in the US) virtually none of the main sources (coal 49%, NG 22%, nuclear 19%, hydro 6%, renewables 2.5% in 2007) is facing a near-term, or even mid-term, supply crunch. Projections of mid-term peak coal are based on strong growth in consumption, and at present there is no growth in coal consumption. Therefore, the US very likely does have 100+ years of coal at current rates (due to the poor likelihood of use increasing beyond current rates). NG has made a remarkable comeback and is showing a strong surge of <a href=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/ng/hist/n9070us2m.htm rel=nofollow>growth</a> due to shale gas, and the shale gas potential is extremely large. There are no show-stoppers in the way of maintaining and expanding nuclear. Hydro can certainly hang in there, or expand slightly. And renewables are growing rapidly, and are far from their eventual limits. That's 98.5% of the US electric system, so there doesn't seem to be any strong reason for electricity to run short in the next quarter century, when (if I understand you correctly) you predict the internet will dwindle to a shadow of its former self. <br><br>It's also unclear why, given the above, that the price of electricity will rise to inordinate levels. Even when oil rose 1600% in the greatest spike in real oil prices in history, from $10 in 1998 to $170 in Summer 2008 (and there were similar spikes in coal and NG prices), <a href=http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epm/table5_3.html rel=nofollow>retail electric rates in the US</a> rose a mild 57% from $0.07 to $0.11 per kwh, still incredibly cheap compared to countries with high rates like Italy ($0.26 per kwh in 2007).<br><br>2) I believe you are drastically underestimating the value of telecommuting/teleconferencing in the post-peak future. Even extremely high oil prices have only a marginal effect on electric rates, as noted above, so telecommuting (or visiting with relatives over skype etc.) will be precisely the sort of constrained consumer choice you describe in this post. Shall I drive/fly, or go virtually? When oil prices get high enough, people will choose the latter because it's convenient and vastly cheaper. Therefore, the internet will thrive. It's a way for people to virtually meet without physically moving, so it's an excellent remedy for a transport fuels crisis (which peak oil will be). The internet does consume a fair amount of energy, but I don't think you can reasonably argue that it costs more (in money/energy) to transport people's images than their actual bodies.<br><br><a href=economics-of-decline.html#c8940011490789577471 title="comment permalink">5/22/09, 6:22 AM</a><br><br>

The most likely result is rising prices and diminished access, and the rise of alternatives, until the internet stops being economically viable altogether.</b>This has gone from frustrating to fascinating. We've got a significant minority of posters whose response to the argument I;ve just described isn't to debate it, but to act as though it hasn't been made -- in effect, as though the post they're supposedly commenting on doesn't exist. Is it simply the online equivalent of scrunching up one's eyes, covering one's ears, and chanting "I can't hear you, nya nya nya" over and over again? Or is there more going on here? <br><br>One way or another, all further comments that simply reiterate the same two points will be deleted.

Ham radios use a maximum of 1500 watts ERP, and a growing number of hams are getting into QRP -- low power operation -- using 5 watts or less to make transcontinental contacts. Nor is CW the only option; you might want to look up the words "packet radio" sometime. Your third world countries don't manufacture their own mesh network technology, nor -- to repeat the argument you're ignoring -- will such technologies be economical as the energy needed to make them becomes the single largest manufacturing cost, and other technologies that can do the same things more cheaply take their place. <br><br>Disillusioned, you're quite correct that many landline phone systems will be viable for quite some time. While they can be used by computers, they also form one of the competing systems of communication that, to bring up yet again the central issue of my post, will be more economical to use than the internet in an energy-constrained future. <br><br>Neven, the earth has been through sudden temperature increases of 5-6 degrees C. hundreds of times in its long history, and at least once during the history of our species -- the end of the last ice age saw jumps on that scale. It'll make life difficult for a lot of people, and drive some pretty sharp population contractions, but it's not the end of the world. Nor has the advent of the internet shown any sign of making it easier for humanity to deal with its problems -- quite the opposite, in fact. <br><br>Das Monde, it would take an entire post to respond to your comments, and that will have to wait. In the meantime, thanks for the links!<br><br>Joe, you've missed the fact that I'm talking about a gradual process unfolding over some decades. All fossil fuels are subject to severe depletion, so electricity prices -- since nearly all the world's electricity is generated by fossil fuels -- will inevitably go up in the years and decades to come. As for the internet as a replacement for live meetings, telephones do the same thing with a much simpler infrastructure; so do many other technologies -- and moving people around for meetings takes up a vanishingly small fraction of total energy use in the first place, so that's a red herring at best. <br><br>Kiashu, this is funny. In accusing me of mischaracterizing other people's comments, you've completely mischaracterized mine -- and, once again, ignored the economic argument central to the post about which this discussion is supposedly happening. I've been saying all along that <b> he internet will limp on for decades, until rising costs, diminishing access, and competition from more economically viable modes of communication finally push it over the edge.</b> Now here you come, saying basically the same thing, and insisting that I'm claiming something else!<br><br><a href=economics-of-decline.html#c1489149668535413234 title="comment permalink">5/22/09, 8:49 AM</a><br><br>

In much the same way the Ivan Illich (Energy and Equity) illustrated that transportation beyond a certain speed degrades mobility and even humanity. Beyond a certain band width communication is degraded by the current internet. Millions of blogs contain the thoughts, insights, hopes and dreams of the author, but no one reads them.

My guess is that as economic contraction proceeds, the current servers will turn out to be far too much computing capacity for a diminished amount of work; the cost of energy will make them white elephants, and the cost of replacement servers -- which embody a great deal of energy -- will also climb. At a certain point it will once again make more economic sense to hire bookkeepers with pens and ledgers, because their wages will be significantly lower than the cost of buying, servicing, and powering a computer. <br><br>James, all these are points I've already covered. Of course technologies such as packet radio (which I've mentioned repeatedly) can be used to speed data transfer over the air. Of course legacy technology is going to have a major impact on the downslope of the curve, not least because it's more economical to use the embodied energy in old machines than to let them sit and gather cobwebs. The point I've been trying to make here is that economic forces, not merely abstract technical possibility, constrain whether or not it will be possible in the future to sit at a device and read a document there. If the economics won't support the device, you might just have to get a copy of the document on paper instead. <br><br>Disillusioned, I don't know of such a booklist, but it would be very much worth assembling one. If you want to take it on as a project, you might consider a blog or a Wiki. (The fact that I don't expect the internet to last indefinitely doesn't blind me to its present usefulness.)<br><br>Coyote, that's also a point. Every technology has its downside, the internet as much as any, and the decision to keep or abandon a technology is as much social as economic. <br><br>Keleto, if those points are so obvious, why have so many of the commenters here ignored them and insisted that the only factors that need to be considered are the value of the internet and the technical feasibility of running it on a bit less power? Still, you've made a solid point; if a deliberate and well-funded effort were to be made to produce really durable computers that could run off a broad range of possible power sources, those could become core legacy technologies for potentially a very long time. On the other hand, do you know of any such effort being made or planned? I don't, and we probably don't have that much time before constraints on money, energy, and resources start limiting our options in a big way. <br><br>Juan, what I've read leads me to think that the big stone heads used only a very small fraction of the total wood harvest on Easter Island. Still, every little bit hurts. As for the survival value of the internet, well, has all that information flow actually done anything, say, to slow down global warming or coordinate a response to peak oil?

Schumacher's thought<br>resonates with the "distributism"<br>discussed by JMG, by blog contributor<br>Danby, and by others, under JMG's<br>"Some Advice for Distributists" (2009<br>March 18).<br><br>Thirdly, I would like to stress<br>that distributism has a resonance in<br>the practical theology of "Catholic<br>Worker" houses in many of the big<br>North American cities (including here<br>in the Toronto area, at Zacchaeus<br>House, at 5 Close Avenue, near King<br>and Dufferin; people eat communally<br>at 7:00 pm Thursdays; it is normal<br>to turn up without phoning ahead; one<br>might consider bringing a watermelon<br>or jar of jam, or something similar,<br>for the pantry, as indeed I tend to<br>when I find myself able to make that<br>King-and-Dufferin journey from here in<br>Richmond Hill, in the Toronto suburbs).<br><br>Fourthly, I would like to suggest<br>that the idea of Schumacher-inspired<br>economics might be coupled with an<br>investigation of mediaeval guilds. The<br>guild ensured that workers laboured<br>for themselves, or at worst for their<br>seniors-in-the-craft, rather than<br>for capitalists. Additionally, the<br>guild ensured that workers did not<br>compete with one another. - Many of<br>us will feel the ethos of competition<br>to be one of the driving forces in our<br>current ruin: I prosper in trade by (as<br>it were) setting a lower price than my<br>colleague, or by (as it were) scheming<br>to make my own payroll cost less than<br>my colleague's payroll costs; at every<br>wretched turn, I thus exalt myself,<br>as individual, above my city, above<br>the streets of the big welcoming human<br>herd-or-hive, above that cooperative<br>setting in which a human life may well<br>be genetically programmed to thrive.<br><br>How, one might now ask, did this<br>so-salutary idea of a guild get<br>established in the Byzantine Empire,<br>given that Constantinople had in<br>many other things sought to conserve<br>legacies of Imperial Rome? Was it<br>through Byzantium, or through other<br>means (I don't know the answer)<br>that the guild formalism established<br>itself in the new cities of the<br>West - as one can so vividly imagine<br>when leafing a coffee-table book of<br>the surviving Lower-Town streets<br>from Hanseatic Tallinn? And what<br>mechanisms led to the abandonment of a<br>so-self-evidently-salutary social idea<br>after 1600 or so?<br><br>And (with a view now to the future,<br>not to history), where are the most<br>promising current incarnations of<br>the guild idea? Do we find echoes of<br>the guild in the current Debian Linux<br>distribution - in the software stem<br>from which some more conventionally<br>capitalist-corporate distros,<br>including Ubuntu, and including the<br>ASUS "Eee PC"-driving Xandros, have<br>been forked? The distro, that is,<br>with a charter formally forswearing<br>capitalistic-competitive ambition?<br>Suppose, for the sake of argument,<br>that the horrors of a loss of<br>integrated-chip technology can in some<br>happy parts of the world be fended off.<br>In that hypothetical case, is there any<br>hope that some engineers duly inspired<br>by Debian, in happy jurisdictions<br>possessing appropriately downscaled, <br>cooperatively owned, integrated-circuit<br>fabs, will be able to do for a nascent<br>"open-source hardware" movement<br>what Debian has since 1996 done for<br>software?<br><br><br><br> <br>Sincerely, <br><br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo<br>verbum at interlog dot com<br>http://www.metascientia.com<br><br><a href=economics-of-decline.html#c5719110178894735628 title="comment permalink">5/22/09, 12:17 PM</a><br><br>

Every computer is consciously designed as tomorrow's junk. The same goes for most entertainment systems. Every software package you plunk down 800 bucks on today will be pathetically out of date in a year or two (especially if you want to use it professionally). No doubt this is a manifestation of the economic ideology of infinite growth. It's also lousy for the environment. <br><br>I knew a collector of old mixers (precursors of the modern blender, a la Cuisinart) who showed me some of his models from the 1920s and 30s. The solid steel blades, housings and glass bowls looked and felt as sturdy as the day they came out of the factory. Chances are the well-kept ones will run fine at 100 years old (<i>if</i> the requisite power is available). They need never wind up as toxic landfill. <br>Now <i><b>that</b></i> is my idea of good technology. <br><br>Another item that seems to become rapidly obsolete in the digital world is knowledge. So you learned C or Fortran 18 years ago? So what - how's your HTML, your Javascript, your Cascading Style Sheets? If you've spent years mastering suites of animation and graphics programs, that knowledge will be antiquated within a couple of seasonal sales cycles - and what will it be worth should the internet become a rotting hulk of infrastructure and the relevant data storage and playback systems cease to be used? Based on those kind of predications, education itself seems to have a built-in obsolescence. <br><br>Remember when Morse code was officially decommissioned a few years ago? If radio plays a big part in our future, it would hardly be astonishing to see it make a comeback. <br><br>It occurs to me to make a modest proposal. Here and elsewhere I have encountered recommendations that we make a point of learning essential crafts and livingry skills: candle making, soap making, carpentry, permaculture and organic gardening, community gardening, "ham" radio, book arts, papermaking, how to use a slide rule, how to insulate your house, go off-grid, dig wells, build windmills, make water catchment systems, etc, etc. But I know of no one place to acquire all these skills. Once the internet's kaput, or widely unavailable, there will be no universally accessible source for such information and we'll each be on our own, which to my way of thinking is not a promising or well-boding state of affairs. So - what about creating a school or learning center for such skills? Or a network of them? Perhaps people with knowledge in various areas could trade skills with and teach one another, so that it's not strictly a matter of paying cash upfront for knowledge, (which would necessarily cut out some of the people who most need that knowledge). I'm not a person with organizational ability or the ready ability to put such a proposal into action, but it seems like it would be a good idea for someone start it. If someone did, I'd be happy to jump on board. Just a thought.<br><br><a href=economics-of-decline.html#c86835306129491894 title="comment permalink">5/22/09, 12:25 PM</a><br><br>

I suspect that libraries at private colleges and universities may have the best shot at long-term survival, but we'll see. <br><br>Keleto, give me a billion dollar bailout and I'd be happy to see some of it go to such a project -- though there are other things that deserve the lion's share. You may be right that responding to comments here is unnecessary, but the conversations are useful to me much more often than not, as a way to refine my thinking, and also to point up places where collective thinking is stuck in ruts. <br><br>Tom (again), all good points -- and many thanks for the references to physics and radio texts. I'll be dealing with the background to Schumacher's ideas in rather more detail in a later post. <br><br>Kevin, as modest proposals go, yours is more practical than Jonathan Swift's but would require about as substantial a departure from contemporary practice. I've begun to think about what might usefully be done in terms of an organized response to the predicament of industrial society; a school would be costly, but not out of the question if the funding could be arranged.

I totally understand your frustration, but you must know that I fully agree with almost everything you write and when writing comments I try to leave my wishful thinking out of the equation as best I can.<br><br>Although on the face of it I might come across as someone who scrunches up his eyes, covers his ears, and chants "I can't hear you, nya nya nya" over and over again, I might actually turn out to be the über-doomer here. Pardon me for going off topic (though indirectly it is very much on topic).<br><br>I'm quite certain that your statements about climate change are incorrect.<br><br><i>Neven, the earth has been through sudden temperature increases of 5-6 degrees C. hundreds of times in its long history, and at least once during the history of our species -- the end of the last ice age saw jumps on that scale. It'll make life difficult for a lot of people, and drive some pretty sharp population contractions, but it's not the end of the world.</i>Not according to the science:<br><br><i>The other important difference between the glacial-interglacial cycles and today is the rapidity of the current change. The rate of warming is on the order of 10 times faster today than in the ice cores.<br><br>Such rapid warming on a global scale is quite rare in the geological record, and while it may not be entirely unprecedented, there is strong evidence that whenever such a change has happened, whatever the cause, it was a catastrophic event for the biosphere.</i>http://www.grist.org/article/climate-is-always-changing<br><br>JMG, when it comes to the theory of Anthropogenic Global Warming there are a lot of uncertainties, nobody knows what's going to happen exactly, but I think it should have a prominent place in any theory that deals with societal collapse. If things play out like you more or less predict, I'd like to be so bold as to say that chances are very high that humanity is doomed to go extinct.<br><br>To end with an on topic remark, I think this was a very important argument made by Juan Wilson. In fact, IMO it was the best remark in all comments, so I'd like to repeat it here:<br><br><i>My point is that modern society may put a very high priority on internet communication beyond the normal dynamics of economic reality.<br><br>The overall case you make is sound, but I think you have underestimated the significance of the worldwide telecommunication and internet transfer of information regarding the health of the planet.<br><br>It is not just an "advantage" to have a planet-wide neural network at this time, it is a "necessity".<br><br>The only "safe way down" from the pinnacle of human population we now face is with planetary scale monitoring and distribution of information concerning things like green house gasses and deforestation.<br><br>I would add that blogs like yours, Richard Heinberg, James Kunstler (and even our www.islandbreath.org's modest efforts) are bringing critical information to light that otherwise would only be shared between friends in a coffee house.</i>JMG, you replied:<br><br><i>As for the survival value of the internet, well, has all that information flow actually done anything, say, to slow down global warming or coordinate a response to peak oil? I don't see any evidence that it has.</i>Perhaps not yet, but it very well might in a society that's slowly collapsing, when people wake up and go looking for information that helps them shape up practically and mentally.<br><br>The irony is that the existence of your blog is the strongest counterargument to what you have written in this last blog post.

This is because there are a number of countries which economically produce most of their power without any FF at all: France (80% Nuclear, 10% Hydro; $0.15 per kwh), Sweden (51% Nuclear, 40% Hydro, $0.15), Belgium (60% Nuclear, $0.15). The question is how quickly and smoothy countries can switch from FF to non-FF sources, and the example of France (or even the US in the 70s) would suggest that, under the right conditions, a tremendous amount of switching can occur in decades (or a century, in the case of coal). The speed at which grid-parity solar can diffuse is an interesting and open question. As is the future of battery technology. It's illegitimate to simply assume, as you do, that the decline of FFs translates inevitably into a decline in electricity availability.<br><br><i>As for the internet as a replacement for live meetings, telephones do the same thing with a much simpler infrastructure; so do many other technologies -- and moving people around for meetings takes up a vanishingly small fraction of total energy use in the first place, so that's a red herring at best.</i>This is a very inadequate and facile answer. <br><br>First of all, you've produced no evidence whatsoever that people traveling to meet people "takes up a vanishingly small fraction of total energy use". I would contend that a huge fraction of travel is for that very purpose. Consider the holiday travel season, or the Lunar New Year in China, when one of the world's largest human migrations occurs so that people can "see their families". <br><br>Secondly, the principle applies to much more than meetings which can be handled over the phone. The roles where telepresence can replace vehicle/plane travel are very numerous: attending school/college, going to church, going shopping, visiting govt. offices to fill out forms, going to the bank, foreign language study, academic conferences, conventions, trade shows, psychological counseling, some types of medical consultation; commuting by government bureaucratic employees, commuting by clerical/info workers (the largest job category by far), commuting by the clerical, engineering, design, marketing, accounting and management staff which account for the bulk of most corporations (even in areas like manufacturing and transport); commuting by accountants, lawyers, insurance company staff, graphic designers, programmers etc. etc.<br><br>The phone and radio are not viable substitutes. They cannot handle these tasks because they do not allow work with imagery, documents or databases etc. People can work on or fill out documents remotely with the internet; that isn't possible with phone or radio.<br><br>Clearly the internet provides strong, economic incentives (in terms of money, time and energy) for virtual movement as opposed to physical driving/flying. Those incentives will only grow stronger as oil prices rise. I'm giving you a specific example where the internet economically outcompetes existing technologies because it is cheaper, and uses far less energy -- precisely your criteria for a technology to survive. And you haven't effectively disputed that point.<br><br><a href=economics-of-decline.html#c7934804521269294326 title="comment permalink">5/22/09, 7:18 PM</a><br><br>

Nor is a stable state guaranteed; Prigogine showed that in an open system, movement away from equilibrium is the most likely result. <br><br>Neven, I'd encourage you to read the last few years of research from the Greenland ice cores -- Brian Fagan's <i>The Two-Mile Time Machine</i> is a good introduction, though it's a bit dated by now. They've documented, for example, that the drastic climate shifts at the beginning and end of the Younger Dryas period -- which were as drastic as anything we're facing -- happened in less than a decade. It is unfortunately true that a great many statements being made about prehistoric climate change in the global warming literature are quite simply incorrect. <br><br>More generally, yes, I'd gathered that you were from the apocalyptic end of the spectrum. I get roughly equal amounts of flak from the cornucopians, who believe the Great God Progress will save us, and from the apocalyptics, who believe the Great God Nature will slay us by the billions in punishment for our sins. As these admittedly satiric summaries may suggest, I feel that both viewpoints are misplaced chunks of religious mythology, applied to the world of secular history where they don't actually offer much in the way of useful guidance to our future. History provides better guidance -- and that's what I've been trying to use to guide this blog. <br><br>Juan, I agree there's good reason to try to preserve as much useful knowledge as possible -- that's one of the reasons why I'd like to see it in some less evanescent form than the internet. As for Gaia's motives, well, last I checked she ain't saying; maybe she's just tired of ice ages and evolved us to get some of her stashed carbon back into circulation!<br><br>Roboslob, go for it. <br><br>Joe, if we can harness all the energy expended in rhetorical handwaving by the proponents of infinite progress, that in itself might solve our energy crisis. Of course if you ignore the laws of thermodynamics and assume that renewables using current solar income can provide the same energy supply as burning through a half billion years of stored sunlight in three centuries, the future looks very bright indeed. I've addressed this point at length elsewhere on this blog as well as in my book <a href=http://www.newsociety.com/bookid/4014 rel=nofollow>The Long Descent</a>. <br><br>Your comments on travel are also handwaving; you've conflated the very small amount of travel that can be replaced by the internet with the entire travel industry -- I'd encourage you to try to sell those Chinese families on the idea that a conversation over Skype is just as good as visiting Mom in Taipei -- and dismissed the fact that conference calls and the like already account for a good deal of the gains credited to the internet via an irrelevancy -- conference calls take place all the time, you know, and nobody seems terribly inconvenienced by the fact that they can't fax a document at the same moment. Of course the internet is a bit more convenient; that's not at issue. Will that convenience justify the hundreds of gigawatts of energy it consumes in a future of energy scarcity, when the same services can be provided at a much lower energy cost by simpler technologies? Of course not. <br><br>Keleto, thanks for your concern. I do find these discussions stressful from time to time, but that comes with the territory; anyone who tries to communicate ideas that cut across the grain of the conventional wisdom can expect that.<br><br><a href=economics-of-decline.html#c7557826111576645406 title="comment permalink">5/23/09, 11:58 AM</a><br><br>

I'll email you. <br><br>If creating schools of "livingry" (to use Bucky Fuller's term) proves prohibitively costly, perhaps some low-cost alternatives might prove viable. An institution with a dedicated building complex and salaried staff is obviously expensive. But it might be feasible to utilize the existing network of local rec centers and adult learning centers which are scattered throughout various municipalities all over the United States (and elsewhere?). I imagine this could be done in an organized, nationally coordinated way rather than haphazardly, perhaps beginning with the internet as an organizing tool, as suggested (use it while we've got it). A ramping up of public awareness of and participation in community gardens, which already exist in various locales, might also be constructive. <br><br>Alternatively, people skilled in various crafts could teach one another out of their homes or studios. This could be done on a modest class-fee basis, or people might trade skills by exchanging lessons with one another. Again, the web could be a viable way to put interested parties in touch with each other locally. <br><br>JMG, about my media questions: as usual you've unerringly put your finger on the critical issue. I'll probably go with print and treat video as an ancillary follow-up. <br><br>I've discovered online a writer whom you may find of interest. His name is Charles Eisenstein. He's written a book which anticipates the unraveling of industrial civilization, is critical of its failure to deliver on many of its promises ("the future is running a little behind schedule") and then proposes his vision for creating a more desirable society within the context of its decline. The quality of his writing is excellent. The title is <i><b>The Ascent of Humanity</b></i>. The full text is available online. In truth I'm curious as to what your response to it might be. <br><br>Sorry if I've gone a bit off-topic.

This is the official policy making access to the web more or less universally equal. When net neutrality comes to an end, it is likely that access to the web will be available only under a pricing hierarchy similar to that of cable television. Those who pay for minimum web service will likely have access only to major corporate websites such as AOL, Google, Yahoo!, CNN, and so forth. Smaller websites produced by individuals and small organizations will be accessible only to those who purchase higher-priced subscriptions, reducing both public access to and the potential audience for such websites, making it less worthwhile to maintain them. At the same time, I suspect, it may become prohibitively expensive for individuals to produce and maintain a website. I anticipate that the privilege of pasting embedded videos and other hi-bandwidth formats into one's website will become an additional price point increasingly unaffordable to most people. The same may eventually become true even of simple jpeg images. Hence the process will work by gradually pricing the public out of the web until it becomes once again the exclusive domain of government, corporations, and large institutions. <br><br>Major telecom companies have already been pushing for the elimination of net neutrality, and their efforts have only been thwarted by outspoken public activism. The increasing energy cost of operating the web will likely strengthen their hand and eventually the relevant agencies will give in. I expect that the media propaganda apparatus will hail these changes as "improvements" of service, at any rate until they and their services disappear altogether or wind up on the military payroll. <br><br>If Obama is a two-termer, and sticks with present policies against lobbying, I would guess that the first step in this process will take place in about ten to twelve years' time. If he's a one-termer, probably sooner. <br><br>Just a guess, and my crystal ball might be cracked. But if it turns out like I said, you heard it here first.<br><br><a href=economics-of-decline.html#c1812125572937922851 title="comment permalink">5/23/09, 11:39 PM</a><br><br>

I'll check Eisenstein out. Thanks also for the comments on things that could be done; as I mentioned a bit earlier, I'm beginning to explore ways in which organized activity might help us face the crisis of the industrial age, and all this grist for the mill. <br><br>710, I'd strongly encourage you to volunteer at a nursing home. You'll find that living things very often go through long gradual declines -- sometimes to a terrifying degree -- before the final systems collapse comes. History also argues against you; the fall of civilizations is pretty much always a gradual, drawn-out process. Our culture's mythology of progress makes it very difficult to realize that there are alternatives to the false dichotomy of perpetual progress and sudden total collapse, but it's high time we look outside that particular box and relearn just how life ripens toward death. <br><br>Kevin, that sounds quite probable to me. I'd also look at taxation as a factor; with trillion-dollar deficits to pay off, I don't see any way governments will be willing to leave the net as tax-free as it is today. Internet access taxes could easily be imposed along the lines of today's phone taxes, for example, and pay-to-play services are another lucrative taxable revenue stream (yes, we will all have to deal with another round of jokes about "a stiff tax on porn" and the like). Online anonymity will also likely be an early casualty. <br><br>As I mentioned, I expect to see some form of internet still around in 25 years; it just won't be anything like as accessible, as cheap, as unrestricted, or as reliable as it is today. How long until it goes away completely? That depends on details of the decline that are pretty much impossible to predict in advance, but those of you who are in your 20s probably won't have it around when you're old.<br><br><a href=economics-of-decline.html#c5079697561147830640 title="comment permalink">5/24/09, 12:27 AM</a><br><br>

If it is rubbish or obvious, then no need to flame me too hard please :-)<br><br>It just occurred to me that when a technology dies in many cases it could be VERY difficult and expensive to revive because often the equipment etc. gets scrapped and the skills base collapses. <br><br>Retooling for a second age of steam railways or a second age of sail, for example, may be very difficult or perhaps impossible, even if they became economically desirable again.<br><br>Similarly, going back to vinyl records, telegraph, non-digital photography or movable type printing (for examples) would be difficult now as the equipment and skills of the previous methods are mostly gone. <br><br>So when at some future point societies find there are not enough resources, energy and skills to keep current systems (eg, the internet) going then it seems unlikely that there will be sufficient skills, energy and resources to retool back to an earlier (but still rather advanced) technology either. <br><br>That suggests that if the 'latest and greatest' technology collapses then rather than being replaced by the previous, slightly less complex technology, instead technique might have to revert right back to the most basic and primitive for a while.<br><br>Lets suppose some critical shortage knocks out, for instance, modern newspaper production. All the previous generations of movable type infrastructure are no longer available as they were melted down, so what then ? All the way back to scribes posting reused paper proclamations on lampposts until people relearn Gutenberg level print technology and paper making. <br><br>For fun, lets suppose the expansionist, 'progress' driven economy recovers for 25 years and further suppose that over that time old-fashioned telephone networks are fully scrapped, poles, wires exchanges and all are ripped out and replaced entirely with voip over digital cellular networks. When the crunch comes, there is no previous generation infrastructure to go back to. Oops. What then ?<br><br>Is this idea going anywhere ? It would seem to point to fairly rapid collapse being possible in certain systems at least, rather than a gradual simplification of technique.<br><br>As I said, I do not insist on these ideas, but they struck me as perhaps interesting enough to share.<br><br><a href=economics-of-decline.html#c2907814944677081825 title="comment permalink">5/24/09, 3:22 AM</a><br><br>

It manifests through the high level of dysfunction in the human world, because the support system is artificial and synthetic and not what we as humans actually need. Like someone on a respirator. We're breathing, sure, but it's not what were designed for. But it feels normal to us, only because every single one of us was born on the respirator.<br><br>We are forced to breathe to the artificial rhythm of schooling, media, religion, and law, which take the place of learning, communication, spirituality, and moral and emotional awareness. We are forced to breathe to the rhythm of money and jobs, which are substitutes for the earned trust and mutual respect that would otherwise come from the exchange of resources and services for mutual support.<br><br>So actually I was off before. We are not so much breathing as much as we are being breathed.<br><br>But that's just how I see it. That said, however, your insights and blog are exemplary and stellar and very much needed.<br><br>Some things I'd like to mention about the people who suggest that the Internet will not be allowed to fail because of its advantages. I don't think there's any curious logic here, it sounds like supposition and hope. Because there are great advantages to never having the Net go down, yet it still does, just like with power outages, and product shortages. There would be great personal advantages to never being injured or dying, and yet that still happens continuously. I think this hope partially comes out of living in a world steeped in the illusion of us being in constant control. The mere suggestion that we're not in constant control evokes fear because most people have never experienced or even thought about it, about not being supported or protected. Most people have no idea how to self-organize, and have no idea how to go about supporting or protecting themselves. At the black abyss of the unknown, denial kicks in, because with no other ideas or options, denial is the only apparent option available.<br><br>So I'll offer an option that has always been useful to me in times like this. I tell myself, "I don't know what to do if this would happen, but since it hasn't happened yet, there's time to figure it out."<br><br>The important part, I think, is to start with "I don't know."<br><br><a href=economics-of-decline.html#c7189740364956568341 title="comment permalink">5/24/09, 3:58 AM</a><br><br>

One of the reasons it's so important to revive simpler technologies as promptly as possible is precisely so that we'll have some Plan B technologies in place when the current extravagant technologies stop being economically viable at all. <br><br>710, I'm certainly not going to claim that today's industrial civilization is viable over more than a fairly short term -- quite the contrary, I suspect the current economic troubles are the first rumbles of a massive crisis that will leave substantial portions of it shredded. My take is simply that the overall collapse will be a much more complex process, with the kind of uneven trajectory found in other historical examples of societies that overshot their resource base. As for the role of wishful thinking in popular visions of the future, no argument there either -- and it's interesting to note that believers in apocalypse seem to be just as prone to this as believers in perpetual progress.

The internet example in this post is totally right on. As with the internet going under and reverting back to simpler methods, so would the current system of food production and distribution. I don't think many people realize how precariously balanced our current system really is.<br><br>As I mentioned in my e-mail, the food systems in this country are heavily dependent on fuel and its availability. As with the internet, if there is no energy, there is no food being stored or moved. It takes vast amounts of energy to refrigerate, freeze, process and move food around large areas of land. And, as with the internet and all of its sub-systems of computers, manufacturing of processors and so on, the food system and all its parts are the same way.<br><br>What happened in Cuba when the Soviet pull out occurred was there was an immediate shortage of fuel. And, consequently, an immediate inability to store and transport food. Even though Cuba is not large by US standards, it is a very warm place. The food rotted. The people went hungry. Suddenly.<br><br>Unless food can be grown locally or regionally and moved quickly to a person's stomach, the day is coming where people are going to radically have to, and here is the key idea, 'change their habits and not their technology'. Fresh meat will become more of a luxury than a staple. Fresh oranges may again be something special that shows up in the midwest around December in straw packed boxes. People away from the hot areas of the country most likely won't have too many fresh salad greens in the winter. Especially in Wisconsin where I live. But, most people's diets are going to change. Weather they want them to or not. People will become aware of seasonal change again. They will get used to local and regional diets again. Basically, because they will have little choice.<br><br>I don't think we would revert back all the way to the sixteen hundreds, but definitely before the industrial age, possibly back to the early eighteen hundreds or late seventeen hundreds. The problem is, that in order to sustain a large human population with these past technologies, we would have to have far fewer people. If the technologies that are currently employed in our industrial society go away, so do the human numbers. In some way, this isn't a problem, as that is what would need to happen to benefit the planet and to help any people to keep living. But, in other ways, I don't relish being in the group that doesn't make it. So, I'm trying not to be ignorant of the current situations. My family and I are trying to set up systems in our lives that will continue to function even though energy becomes scarce or nonexistent. Basically, a home that can function without electricity. Solar panels won't save the day. They take more energy to produce than they give back in their life time use. They need a large infrastructure of factories and technology to maintain. And, if there's no wire able to be smelted and drawn, there won't be a way to get electricity to anything.<br><br>I think people take for granted many things around them until those things are gone. I think people need to really look at their surroundings and the effect their own personal actions, and the actions of their society, are having on the planet. Industrialized people need to start seeing how every action interrelates with the world.<br><br>I think people tend to blindly fight for what they are used to. I think people can relax about change and let it happen without that fight. Because the change is going to happen no matter what. The energy spent fighting to keep "our way of life" is better spent trying to figure out a way to live better in the coming years.<br><br>I think changing habits is a hard thing for most people.

Greer,<br><br>In your earlier post, I took issue with your belief that the internet would likely dissappear as a result of energy scarcity. In this post, you again approach this issue and repeat your prediction. I am disappointed that you did not specify the fundamental assumptions behind your position. The analogy with the Easter Islanders is too flawed to be of any help in my opinion. <br><br>MawKernewek has already supported with evidence the fact that the energy cost of the internet is but a fraction of the energy cost of home computers. Essentially, this means that as long as people can afford to power their home computer, then they can afford to pay their ISP to maintain the internet. Now, 8 hours of using the internet each day on a modest laptop computer costs about 0.4 kWh of electricity, or about 30 US$ct (European prices!), for the energy. To cover the additional energy cost to run the internet (broadband!) is less than 30 US$ct, even when doubling the energy cost per the comments of MawKernewek above. <br><br>So, 60 US$ct all-in total energy costs per person, using European energy prices, for 8 hours of internet use per day. <br><br>This is a miniscule amount of money, and I honestly cannot understand why you are persisting in predicting the inevitable failure of the internet? <br><br>To summarise: You’re position is that the internet will not survive the end of the cheap energy era because it will become too costly to maintain. In support of that position, will you please specify what the cost of internet per subscriber will be in 20 years time according to you, casu quo, so that we can actually see and understand why you are saying what you are saying? <br><br>I will quantify my position on this issue for you to take aim at. My position is that the all-in energy/resource cost of using the internet 8 hours a day with a minimum bandwidth equal to 50kbit/s in the year 2030 anywhere in the inhabited world will not exceed 1 dollar per day. What do you say to that, and please please please support your argument with numbers?<br><br>It frustrates me no end that I understand most of what you have been talking about for years, except this nagging point about the internet not being economically viable!<br><br>Respectfully yours,<br><br>Jev.<br><br><a href=economics-of-decline.html#c8404593672277582463 title="comment permalink">7/24/09, 7:03 AM</a><br><br>
