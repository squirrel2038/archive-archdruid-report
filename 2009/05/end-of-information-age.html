One of the repeated lessons I’ve learned over the three years since <i>The Archdruid Report</i> began appearing is the extent to which many people nowadays have trouble grasping some of the most fundamental facts about the crisis of our times. I had yet another reminder of that a few days back, when the comments on last week’s post started coming in.<br><br>A point made in passing in that post was that railroads, while they are much more efficient than automobile or air transport, still require relatively large amounts of concentrated energy, and so may become uneconomical for many uses at a certain point well down the curve of fossil fuel depletion. One of my readers took rather heated exception to this comment. Only America’s backwards railroads, he pointed out indignantly, relied on fossil fuel; since European and Japanese railways used electricity, they would be unaffected by fossil fuel depletion and could keep rolling along into the far future.<br><br>This kind of logic is common enough these days that it’s probably necessary to point out the flaws in it. Electricity isn’t an energy source; it has to be generated, using some other energy source to do so. The electricity that powers the European and Japanese rail systems is mostly generated by plants that burn coal, with significant help from nuclear reactors and a rather smaller assist from hydroelectric plants. Of these, only the hydroelectric plants are a renewable energy source; the others are poised just as firmly on the downslope of depletion as the diesel oil that runs American locomotives.<br><br>Coal is turning out to be much less abundant than the cozy estimates of a few decades ago made it sound, and of course there’s the far from minor impact of coal burning on an already unstable global climate. Fissionable uranium is well down its own depletion curve, and it’s worth noting that the enthusiastic claims sometimes made for breeder reactors, the use of thorium as a nuclear fuel, and other alternatives to conventional fission plants are very rarely to be heard from people who have professional training in the fields concerned. Thus my reader was quite simply wrong; the European and Japanese rail systems that so excited his admiration are just as dependent on nonrenewable fuels as the American system, and are also just as vulnerable to the economic implications of supply and demand as energy supplies dwindle.<br><br>Now of course there are other reasons why railroads may be kept in service, at least for certain uses, long after they become economic liabilities. Many of the world’s larger nations – the United States and Russia among them – grew to their present size only after rail transport made it possible to exert political and economic power on a continental scale, and future governments may well keep long-distance rail links going as a matter of national survival. That likelihood, though, does nothing to counter the point central to last week’s post: that in a world with much less energy, older and more energy-efficient transport methods such as canal boats may turn out to be much more economically viable than their more recent and more extravagant replacements, and those cities and regions well positioned to take advantage of waterborne transport may therefore thrive in the 21st century as they did in the 19th.<br><br>The same logic can be applied usefully to many other aspects of the future taking shape ahead of us right now. Probably the best example is the looming impact of a future of energy constraints on the ways that modern industrial cultures store, process, and distribute information.<br><br>It’s hard to think of a subject that has been loaded with anything like as much hype. Our time, the media never tires of repeating, is the Information Age, an epoch in which economic sectors dealing with mere material goods and services have been relegated to Third World sweatshops, while the economic cutting edge deals entirely in the manufacture, sales, and service of information in various forms. As usual – can you think of a short-term trend that hasn’t been identified as a wave of the future destined to rise up an asymptotic curve to infinity, or at least absurdity? I can’t – the standard assumption is that the future will be just like the present, but even more so, with more elaborate technologies providing more baroque information products and services as far as the eye (or, rather, the webcam) can see.<br><br>This is hardly a new vision of the future. In his 1909 novella “The Machine Stops,” which should be required reading for anyone who buys into the Information Age hullabaloo, E.M. Forster provided a remarkably exact dissection of contemporary cyberculture’s idea of its destiny most of a century in advance. It’s a great story on its own terms, but it also puts a finger on the central weakness of an information-centered society: information does not exist without a physical substrate, and if the physical substrate goes, so does the information.<br><br>In Forster’s story, that substrate was the Machine – an interconnected technostructure that spanned the globe and provided the necessities and luxuries of life to uncounted millions of people who spent their lives in hivelike cells, staring into screens and tapping on keyboards like so many of today’s computer geeks. Adept at manipulating abstract ideas, the inhabitants of the Machine lost touch with the fact that their universe of information only existed because the physical structure of the Machine kept it there, and their attitude toward the Machine gradually evolved into a religious reverence devoid of any reference to the practical realities of the Machine’s workings. The skills needed to apply physical tools to pipes and wires dropped out of use, and the consequences – minor malfunctions snowballing into major ones, and finally into total systems failure – followed from there.<br><br>Now of course fiction is fiction, and the events that cause the Machine to stop are unlikely to be repeated in the real world. The central concept, though, demands attention, because our Machine – the internet – depends just as much on a physical substrate as the one in Forster’s novella. In our case, that substrate is the global network of communications links and server farms, and the even vaster economic and technical infrastructure that keeps them funded, powered, and supplied with the trained personnel and spare parts that keep them running.<br><br>Very few people realize just how extravagant the intake of resources to maintain the information economy actually is. The energy cost to run a home computer is modest enough that it’s easy to forget, for example, that the two big server farms that keep Yahoo’s family of web services online use more electricity between them than all the televisions on Earth put together. Multiply that out by the tens of thousands of server farms that keep today’s online economy going, and the hundreds of other energy-intensive activities that go into the internet, and it may start to become clear how much energy goes into putting these words onto the screen where you’re reading them.<br><br>It’s not an accident that the internet came into existence during the last hurrah of the age of cheap energy, the quarter century between 1980 and 2005 when the price of energy dropped to the lowest levels in human history. Only in a period where energy was quite literally too cheap to bother conserving could so energy-intensive an information network be constructed. The problem here, of course, is that the conditions that made the cheap abundant energy of that quarter century have already come to an end, and the economics of the internet take on a very different shape as energy becomes scarce and expensive again.<br><br>Like the railroads of the future mentioned earlier in this post, the internet is subject to the laws of supply and demand. Once the cost of maintaining it in its current form outstrips the income that can be generated by it, it becomes a losing proposition, and cheaper modes of information storage and delivery will begin to replace it in its more marginal uses. Governments will have very good reasons to maintain some form of internet as long as they can, even when it becomes an economic sink – it’s worth remembering that the internet we now have evolved out of a US government network meant to provide communication capacity in the event of nuclear war – but this does not mean that everyone in the industrial world will have the same access they do today. <br><br>Instead, as energy costs move unsteadily upward and resource needs increasingly get met, or not, on the basis of urgency, expect access costs to rise, government regulation to increase, internet commerce to be subject to increasing taxation, and rural areas and poor neighborhoods to lose internet service altogether. There may well still be an internet a quarter century from now, but it will likely cost much more, reach far fewer people, and have only a limited resemblance to the free-for-all that exists today. Newspapers, radio, and television all moved from a growth phase of wild diversity and limited regulation to a mature phase of vast monopolies with tightly controlled content; even in the absence of energy limits, the internet would be likely to follow the same trajectory, and the rising costs imposed by the end of cheap energy bid fair to shift that process into overdrive.<br><br>The waning of the internet will pose an additional challenge to the future, because – like other new technologies – it is in the process of displacing older technologies that provided the same services on a more sustainable basis. The collapse of the newspaper industry is one widely discussed example of this process at work, but another – the death spiral of American public libraries – is likely to have a much wider impact in the decades and centuries to come. Among the most troubling consequences of the current economic crisis are wholesale cuts in state and local government funding for libraries. The Florida legislature was with some difficulty convinced a few weeks ago not to cut every penny of state support for library systems – roughly a quarter of all the money that keeps libraries open in Florida – and county and city libraries from coast to coast are cutting hours, laying off staff, and closing branches.<br><br>Some of the proponents of these budget cuts have been caught in public insisting that with the rise of the internet, nobody actually needs public libraries any more. (The fact that many of these people call themselves conservatives proves, if any additional proof is needed, just how empty of content today’s political labels have become; what exactly do they think they’re conserving?) Now of course public libraries provide many services the internet doesn’t, and it also provides them to all those people who can’t afford internet access. The point I’d like to make here, though, is that the public library will still be a viable information technology in a postpetroleum society. When Ben Franklin founded America’s first public library, it may be worth noting, he did it without benefit of fossil fuels.<br><br>If public libraries can be kept open during the waves of economic crisis that punctuate the decline of civilizations, then, everyone will likely be the better for it. I am sorry to say that this is probably not the most likely way things will fall out. The current wave of library downsizing is probably a harbinger of things to come; pressed between too many demands and too little funding to go around, library systems – like public health departments, for example, and a great many other institutions that make community life viable – are far too likely to draw the short straw. Exactly this sort of short-term thinking has driven the loss of vast amounts of information and cultural heritage in the collapse of past civilizations.<br><br>As we move into the penumbra of the deindustrial age, then, it’s crucial to start thinking about the options open to us – individually and collectively – with an eye toward their long-term viability and to the hard reality of a world of ecological limits. When today’s data centers are crumbling ruins long since stripped of valuable salvage, and all the data once stored there has evaporated into whatever realm magnetic patterns go to when they die, the thinking that led politicians to gut viable library systems on the assumption that the internet will take up the slack will look remarkably stupid. Still, the habits of thought instilled by the age of cheap abundant energy are hard to shake off, and from within them, such mistakes are hard to avoid.

The internet seems to have much more in common with print media -- some things like daily newspapers are the vast monopolies you mention, but magazines, newsletters, pamphlets, and zines can be found to cater to any interest. The barriers to entry (at the low end, at least) are very low, and there's no underlying scarcity like there is of frequency bandwidth in radio and TV.<br><br><a href=end-of-information-age.html#c6603710005955069 title="comment permalink">5/13/09, 8:17 PM</a><br><br>

I never did care for the notion of replacing those with computers, as it creates access problems at peak hours that almost never pertained with paper catalogs. <br><br>Having lived abroad I have reason to appreciate what excellent institutions are the public libraries we have to date enjoyed in the United States: the great literature of the world at your fingertips for free, the Encyclopedia Britannica even for the broke. The notion of losing this asset appalls me. <br><br>What you say also suggests that knowledge as such is likely eventually to become a rarer commodity, and therefore more valuable, and expensive. Forty years ago, with a robust U.S. economy and generous federal funding, university education was available as never before to millions of young people who were the first in their families to receive a higher education. But over the past thirty years higher education has become increasingly difficult for poor and even middle class families to finance, and I've known people whose college loans have proven a heavy burden, casting a shadow over their lives for many years afterward. Higher education seems to be returning to what it was a century or so ago: the province of a relatively privileged class. This in turn suggests that, if your prognostications turn out to be accurate, then there may be a lot more ignorant people around, relative to population.

But other things are happening.<br><br>A friend of mine works in IT support for a network of libraries, and he was saying that one of management's goals is to "get as much as possible of the community into the library." Not to get as many people as they can <i>reading books</i>, but physically into the library. Reading is supposed to just follow inevitably after that. So they're considering buying Sony Playstations to get teenagers in. <br><br>The theory is that once the kids are there, they'll sort of almost-by-accident read some books - maybe while they're waiting for their turn to blow away some virtual bad guys. <br><br>I find it hard to articulate the absurdity of it all, except to note as I often do that life looks different depending on you're sitting behind a desk or standing in front of it.<br><br><a href=end-of-information-age.html#c1771035187093744125 title="comment permalink">5/13/09, 9:31 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avtb a_12120c" id=c6918759786316174677></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/00627270393248813976 rel=nofollow>Danby</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>JMG,<br>I agree with you about the need for libraries both now and in the long-term future. As for the reason a so-called conservative would advocate the gutting of the library system, remember that libraries, like a great many cultural institutions, were captured by the political left back in the '70s. A person who looks at all things from a partisan angle, as so many seem to in this country, could advocate such a crime simply to get at his opponents, much as the gay activists and atheists have gone after the Boy Scouts. <br><br>The whole attitude of "It doesn't matter how much good you do, if you oppose my agenda you are evil and must be destroyed." provokes me to despair of this country sometimes. Not that I'm an optimist to start with!<br><br>Getting back to railroads, people forget that any massive infrastructure project such as a railroad requires a massive investment in maintenance to keep in good running order. I live less than 100 yards from the main <br>North-South line of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad. The ties on the line get replaced every 5 years or so. The rails themselves get replaced periodically too, I think on a 30-year life cycle. Switches, grade crossings, telemetry systems, trestles, culverts have to be repaired periodically. And the line has to be repaired after natural and man-made disasters. I know that here near us, the line is shut down completely every four or five years when we get yet another hundred-year flood. Each of these events required hundreds of thousands of dollars in repairs and inspections. The Ash Wednesday earthquake of 2002 shut down the line and required millions in repairs. The train collision that occurred about 30 miles south of us in 1993 closed the line for almost 3 weeks, and required yet more millions in repairs.<br><br>The point is that it takes a lot of economic activity to sustain a railroad. When that sort of economic activity isn't taking place, maintaining a continental railroad network becomes impractical. Local rail lines will be around for a very long time, especially in places like the Northeast and the Northwest, where they will be powered by hydro. Long lines are going to be limited by economic conditions, and the cost of providing the service.<br><br><a href=end-of-information-age.html#c6918759786316174677 title="comment permalink">5/13/09, 9:41 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c5361820383022129775></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/12945962191624903032 rel=nofollow>Stephen Heyer</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Hi John,<br>Thanks! Finally a post with lots to disagree over, well… actually… to kind of go off at an angle to.<br><br>FIRST<br><br>John Greer: “A point made in passing in that post was that railroads, while they are much more efficient than automobile or air transport, still require relatively large amounts of concentrated energy, and so may become uneconomical for many uses at a certain point well down the curve of fossil fuel depletion. One of my readers took rather heated exception to this comment. Only America’s backwards railroads, he pointed out indignantly, relied on fossil fuel; since European and Japanese railways used electricity, they would be unaffected by fossil fuel depletion and could keep rolling along into the far future.”<br><br>I can only repeat the points I made in my previous post - Thomas the Tank Engine railways, that is, simple, robust railways, probably mostly steam powered, like we had up till about the 1950s can:<br><br>1. Run on about anything burnable: low grade coal; peat, wood from plantations; compressed straw; compressed blocks from high-yield fiber plantations; probably even compressed cow dung. They don’t really require “large amounts of concentrated energy” in the modern sense so we are always going to be able to fuel this kind of railway. For the benefit gained the fuel costs are negligible and always will be.<br><br>2. Be built and maintained, including rolling stock, by workshops that any regional center can afford, as they often were in the 1950s.<br><br>3. All the equipment has a very long service life and most of the materials can be easily recycled.<br><br>4. The social and economic advantages of a rail network of this type are immense: Everyone who can is going to do everything they can to have one.<br><br>5. There is not that much to gain from the considerable cost of going to a “modern”, higher speed rail system.<br><br>SECOND<br><br>John Greer: “Of these, only the hydroelectric plants are a renewable energy source…”<br><br>Sadly, while true in the strict sense, this is not true in practice: I’m told that all dams have a finite life, eventually they fill up with silt.<br><br>I suppose it could be cleared out, it would make good farm soil, but in practice this does not seem to happen.<br><br>THIRD<br><br>John Greer: “…and it’s worth noting that the enthusiastic claims sometimes made for breeder reactors, the use of thorium as a nuclear fuel, and other alternatives to conventional fission plants are very rarely to be heard from people who have professional training in the fields concerned.”<br><br>We must be using different sources. About all the sources I’ve read extolling the virtues of the above technologies are/were nuclear industry insiders, often people with a lifetime’s experience in the industry.<br><br>In fact, I tended to regard their enthusiasm for all things nuclear with some caution precisely because they were industry insiders.<br><br>You can probably find links to some of the original papers at Energy from Thorium (http://thoriumenergy.blogspot.com/).<br><br>I have to emphasize that I’m hardly a nuclear enthusiast, but neither am I willing to dismiss a power source that could soften the transition, especially in the vast cities of the modern world.<br><br>FOURTH<br><br>John Greer: “…the two big server farms that keep Yahoo’s family of web services online use more electricity between them than all the televisions on Earth put together.”<br><br>Are you sure of this John? <br><br>On pure common sense grounds that just doesn’t sound right. To begin with, about every mud hut in the world has at least one TV that is on much of the night and TVs are hungry beasts when it comes to electricity: A significant fraction of the world’s electricity production must go to television sets.<br><br>Are you telling me that Yahoo’s two big server farms consume a significant percentage of the whole Earth’s electricity production?<br><br>I’ve been part owner and programmer of a medium size ISP myself and I can tell you that each client’s share of the power consumption of our server farm was miniscule. Our system handled thousands of clients and I guess consumed something like the power of a couple of normal suburban houses (not McMansions).<br><br>I might also add that IT and Telecommunications equipment is getting steadily more efficient in energy use. Further, there are several generations of new technologies in various stages of development that ensure it will continues to get more efficient for a considerable time into the future.<br><br>Perhaps this is why mobile phones and the Internet are continuing their astonishing push into some of the most benighted parts of the third world.

Hydro projects typically last about 100 years, and after that the reservoir is full of silt.

We should remember that energy efficiency is making leaps and energy requirements might also drop faster than energy costs. In particular, the networks you mention are using half the energy today to run (most recent technology) than when they got rolled out about 10 years ago: a 3G mobile base station needs about 8000kWh per year, while an old 2G base station needed 20000kWh. The same could be said about fixed networks. My company surveyed fixed telecom exchanges five years ago to find large rooms filled with A/C systems, not they fit in a corner of the same room as the active IT equipment. They also use half the energy or less.<br><br>* I think we can call information age a day, as well. Let's now be in the Energy Age.

Greer. The 'information superhighway' is a potentially massive CONSERVER of energy, because it allows optimal communication-at-a-distance, which means less personal miles travelled and thus less energy use. I say potentially, because we have yet to get over our (often) petty insistence to move our physical bodies about so much, despite the possibilities offered by the internet.<br><br>As energy prices rise going forward, personal transport will become unaffordable LONG before using the internet will.<br><br>Even if the internet infrastructure becomes too expensive to expand further on a commercial basis, it will certainly be maintained in it's present form. f.e. I currently enjoy the luxury of 20Mbit of download capacity. That's easily 19.9 Mbit more than I (or anyone) really needs! In other words: if I absolutely had to, I'd be happy to pay the same monthly fee as I do now for 20Mbit but get only 100kbit. The rest of that 19.9 mbit is sheer luxury. If that luxury would have to go: so be it! No skin off my back, and NOT the end of the information age.<br><br>I could go on.... <br><br>Point is: the idea that internet will become uneconomical in the face of long-term energy scarcity or even extended economic malaise is just nuts. It would take global war to kill the internet.<br><br>Same difference concerning rail transport. Sure: you have to electrify it to make it sustainable, and the USA has failed miserably on that point (unless you count the present opportunity to modernise it now with gov't stimulus money as a positive, which you might!). But the energy efficiency of a MODERN electric train is extremely impressive! In the Netherlands our electric trains are routinely fitted with energy recovery braking systems, working &gt;90% efficient. That makes the modern electric train easily the most sustainable mode of transport out there bar NONE (not even walking!)<br><br>So I conclude you missed the mark with this one Mr Greer!

Some companies are already looking in that direction. If this happens, it will take us back to the early days when Internet access was something only a lucky few had - and those who did have it paid dearly for it. It will likely also cut by a fair margin the number of websites out there serving up "information" of one type or another, since fewer people will be able to pay to blog and twitter all day, and advertising revenues will drop due to lower traffic volumes. <br><br>Also, if the economy keeps going as it has been this past couple of years, who knows how many internet providers will still be around to provide service?

For example, "it’s worth remembering that the internet we now have evolved out of a US government network meant to provide communication capacity in the event of nuclear war". Whence did you conjure this opinion? I think it is widely recognized that the Internet evolved out of an academic network between universities wishing to share data. A quick read of the RFCs (Requests for Comment) that fundamentally define the construction of our current network topology would seem to confirm such a hypothesis.<br><br>I also think that your fundamental presupposition is wrong. You assume that on a philosophical level, content and access providers will attempt to grow without regard for resource provisioning. This flies in the face of technological advances happening all around us. Google is working with Intel to create chips that will run almost 10 degrees hotter than they can currently. In fact, Google is already running prototype chips that run 5 degrees hotter, and they are running some server farms without any air conditioning. When you consider that temperature control accounts for almost 75% of the total cost of operations, we are seeing vast improvements unfold before our very eyes. The push towards low power CPUs, solid state drives, geothermally cooled server rooms, even Google oceanic server farms (among others), is happening all around us. Considering further that wireless broadband is expanding, bringing high speed Internet to the country without new infrastructure to build and maintain--I see no reason to believe that answers to the energy crisis are not already being developed and deployed.<br><br><a href=end-of-information-age.html#c6069561750170630720 title="comment permalink">5/14/09, 10:35 AM</a><br><br>

Fortunately the old technology of letterpress and sewn-signature bindings is still very much alive. <br><br>Kevin, all good points.

As for railroads, no argument there. <br><br>Stephen, yes, we've been through most of this before. Of course it's theoretically possible to keep a bunch of tank engines running on biomass or whatever; the question is whether it will be economical to do so in a future where the same fuel may have many other potential uses, and other modes of transport -- to say nothing of local manufacture -- will be competing with what's left of a rail system. Dams can indeed be dredged, and yes, the muck you get from doing so is a first-class soil amendment. As for the nuclear thing, well, we've been around that quite a few times and I see no point in rehashing the argument again. <br><br>Alexia, granted, the internet has major advantages -- I also buy used books online, for example. Might be worth using it while it's here. <br><br>Librarian, you're welcome! I'm delighted to hear that today's grad students get it -- they're the generation that will have to navigate what's left of today's libraries through some very trying times over the next several decades. <br><br>Matt, I agree that railroads will be around for quite a while -- it's just that they will stop being economically viable at a certain point down the slope, and those that remain will be kept going for political or military reasons. As for the internet, I don't expect it to fragment, barring a major war; more likely, it'll be maintained as long as possible, but access to it will become steadily more difficult. <br><br>Janne, I could see national networks if there's war, and corporate networks are also likely. <br><br>O'Kelly, the question of what to keep and what to salvage is going to be a major issue in the decades to come. It always is in the declining phase of civilizations. <br><br>Professor, I don't have such a list, and would rather see everyone come up with their own -- monoculture is as dangerous in the ecology of ideas as in any other context. <br><br>Slipr, I'm familiar -- at least in general -- with the push for efficiency under way in the computing industry right now. It would be interesting to see a net energy analysis on the improvements. <br><br>David, notice that your system of ages assumes that history speeds up as it proceeds. I don't buy that; it's simply that things look more important when they're closer to us. We're still in the industrial age, and that will most likely be followed by the longer, slower deindustrial age. <br><br>Scott, a packet radio system for text communication and file sharing is an excellent step, and I hope to see some projects along these lines taking shape in the not too distant future. <br><br>Jevandorp, communication at a distance has been available since the 1850s, with the emergence of the telegraph. Any savings of energy from teleconferencing, etc. were achieved long ago -- ever heard of a conference call? Yet the same rhetoric still gets rehashed every time somebody wants to insist that the latest, most resource-intensive and extravagant technology will save us money. <br><br>Meetings account for a very small proportion of energy use worldwide, and goods and services still have to be physically moved from place to place -- try eating a hamburger over a teleconferencing link sometime. As for the electric trains, you're still skating past the key point -- where is the electricity coming from? Talking about the wonders of electric trains without dealing with the source of the electricity is nothing more than handwaving. <br><br>Panidaho, this sort of internet rationing by price is exactly the sort of thing I expect to see in the not too distant future. <br><br>Christopher, my understanding is that the internet evolved out of DARPAnet, which was originally conceived as a hardened communications network for nuclear war; I've been told this by more than one professor of computer science. If it's inaccurate, well, there you are. As for the other issue, I think you've missed my point; I'm aware of the current push toward more efficient server farms; my argument is that in a world with radically curtailed energy and resource supplies, even a more efficient internet will no longer be economical for many of its current uses, and access to it will be sharply restricted in an effort to keep it running for government and business. Nothing you've adduced conflicts with that model of the future. <br><br>Witchchild, excellent. As you deal with other librarians and work toward that MLS, you might see if anyone else is open to thinking about ways to deal with the deindustrial future; that's one profession that could have a very positive impact on the future, if enough people get a sense of what's coming and what they might do about it.<br><br><a href=end-of-information-age.html#c1665253212636559024 title="comment permalink">5/14/09, 12:41 PM</a><br><br>

It is a given that non-renewable fuels are in shorter supply with each passing day; what is not given is the degree to which alternative fuels can and will be introduced to mitigate declining natural resources.

You also seem to ignore the other aspect of technological progress in the age of diminished resources: that technology providers will out of necessity find ways to accomplish more with less. The drive to do this has already begun using (but not limited to) some of the advances I suggested before. It is utterly rational to presume that innovators will find ways to do more with less. This is the whole trend of technological innovation: reducing cost and increasing efficiency. The industry that has developed around the communications platform that is the Internet favors nothing if not prescience. <br><br>That said, I do not assume the 'magic' of technology will solve our problems for us; but the major players seem to be conscious of the stumbling blocks to continued sustainability and sufficient planning seems to be in the works to ensure the Internet's good health for many decades to come.<br><br><a href=end-of-information-age.html#c1292288851660732110 title="comment permalink">5/14/09, 1:49 PM</a><br><br>

As the network was deployed and more government and research institutions were connected to it, the Defense Department took over the project ARPA.

The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), the original developers of the early packet-switched network that came to be called the ARPANET, was renamed the (U.S.) Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1971. For this reason, it is often assumed that the ARPANET was then called the DARPANET. However, the Internet Society's own history of the Internet, written by its chief inventors, suggests that it continued to be called ARPANET until ownership was transferred to other groups.

Not included in this figure are the fossil fuels used in pavement, manufacture of the vehicles, and disposal of the vehicles. <br><br>When the time comes to make hard choices as to what we will keep vs what we will jettison, it would be wise to give the internet priority, while working to make it more efficient in energy use. My computer and wireless connection have made magazines, most personal printing, my old stereo rig, and television completely redundant. If you have your computer, there's no excuse for wasting money on these other things.

Email and online bill pay save tons of paper and mail transport.

I'm definitely not a believer in unmitigated "progress" and I do believe we are on the doorstep of a radically different (and low-powered) future, but I do have some disagreements with some of the ideas exposed here lately, about what will and will not be viable on a future without significant fossil fuel usage. <br><br>I might be wrong, but I'm getting the vibe from the last few posts that the Archdruid believes that basically anything that didn't existed in 1830 or so will, gradually, disappear for good. All the technology invented since then is an attachment of the fossil fuel age and will die with it, even if it takes some time for it to happen. I disagree with that. <br><br>I do believe that there's a range of technologies that have been invented since the 1830's (and the information stuff of the last 40 years or so are big on my list) that are, in fact, sustainable without the ubiquitous use of energy we have nowadays. It's just that the use we currently apply to these technologies today is wasteful. The problem is on the "software" we use, not the "hardware", so to speak. In essence, I believe the way we USE the technology will dramatically change, but not the technology itself (with the exception of a few dead ends, things that exist solely to serve the consumer society). <br><br>I think the internet is THE major example of that. I have heard anecdotal evidence that about 80% of all internet traffic consists of video streaming or peer-to-peer networks (the last one can roughly be divided into video as well, computer games, music and programs, mostly pirated). There's also the old joke that half or more of said activities are porn-related in one way or another. So, yes, at present, the internet is a hugely wasteful system that can't be maintained. But, I do believe the internet passes the threshold where it's legitimate uses outstrip it's costs, even on a world with far fewer resources, that there's a good chance that it will be maintained in some form. <br><br>In general, I think a lot of the technologies the Archdruid is marking for extinction will, in fact, go trough a drastic diet. Some are dead-ends, for sure, and will vanish. The Internal Combustion Engine, in particular, seems to be heading for a very niche application on heavy machinery before it's final extinction, being substituted by a combination of electric engines and low-energy forms of transport (water canals, sailing/kite ships, etc) for some uses while other uses (commuting 40 miles each way for a deskjob alone in a SUV, for example) will simply disappear. <br><br>Think about electricity, for example, another technology that wasn't widespread until the turn of the twentieth century. Is that going to disappear as well? As in, no electricity anywhere, in a couple of centuries? Loosing the ability to manufacture a power generator? I think that's highly unlikely, unless some combination of nuclear war, disease, famine and climate chaos reduces the human population below a threshold of 100 million people or so scattered in small bands here and there. And I say that because electricity is a HUGE power-saver. A high-efficiency, low-power electric engine beats all other competing technologies, hands-down, on that aspect, even if you multiply the cost to build and maintain said engine several times(reflecting higher energy costs, etc), it's still better then anything else. It's simply a good invention, one that will likely stick with humanity for the future in the long run. <br><br>Yes, there are higher fixed costs in much of the technology we use today, and said costs will be increasingly more important in the future, as we go trough energy descent. That means some things will be too expensive to be used by "regular folks" everyday, some will be drastically changed and some will disappear. A lot of the wisdom of the past, on how to live with less, will be really important again. Growing food, for one. Patching up clothes and shoes, etc. I do not think, though, that we are basically going back to the early XIX century. I don't equate having to sew the holes in my future shirts with not having electrical lights in the house. <br><br>There are several reasons for that. One is that most of all technology is really widespread today. There are people who know how to build most of it in every corner of the globe. Even if a certain part of the world crashes badly enough to, say, loses the ability to build a certain thing, someone in another place will probably keep it going. That's basically how Europe crawled out of the Middle Ages. Second, we have an economic incentive to build crappy, inefficient things today. Once there's a incentive to do otherwise, I bet someone will come up with a computer chip that uses 1/10th the energy of today's chip, it will be able to run without significant cooling and will have a Mean Life of 15+ years. It will probably be slower then a chip today, and it will spend 15 years without gaining any performance, but that's not a problem, because even a low-performing chip can substitute hundreds and hundreds of human "computers" doing things like tabulating taxes, among a million others. A chip like that can have it's fixed costs amortized over a longer period and will be vastly more sustainable. Third, and more disturbing, I firm believe that the more powerful 1 billion people in the planet will let the other 5 billion die (and probably help it) before giving up electricity, for example. It's ugly, but it's the truth. Once we reach a suitable low-enough level of population, we can afford to maintain more things. <br><br>That last point ties with my last thought. That is, some of the things that were "sustainable" in 1830 were only so because they were being explored by less then 1 billion people. Also, some of it wasn't sustainable at all. I believe JMG himself wrote somewhere that coal was first widely used because of "peak timber" in Europe and I also read some interesting article on The Oil Drum about "peak whale oil" in the XIX century. Lighting by fish oil, firewood and peat is probably LESS economic and sustainable then a high-efficiency, low-power LED light-bulb, even if you account all the industrial costs to build it, if you are talking about lighting the houses of more then half a billion people or so. <br><br>Anyway, sorry for the rant and possibly for the confusion, I typed what came to mind, just adding my opinion on the matter.<br><br><a href=end-of-information-age.html#c4110123094641395835 title="comment permalink">5/14/09, 7:38 PM</a><br><br>

As someone who has worked in corporate data centers for 15 years, and in the telecom business for 10, it seems to me that very few of your commenters have any idea of the amount of power needed to maintain our current telecom infrastructure. <br><br>My current employer, one of the largest telecom companies in the world, recently calculated their total energy footprint. They came up with a number in excess of 3GW.<br><br>It's far more than just the servers that deliver web pages. There are the telecom switches, the routers, the repeater stations every 10 Km on the fibre line, the microwave relay stations, the cellphone towers and their associated telecom hardware, the metering, billing and monitoring systems, the backbone interconnects, the customer support systems, the infrastructure for all the employees, the power conditioning and emergency power systems, the storage area networks and disk arrays, and most of all, the cooling systems. <br><br>Pace the above poster, a CPU that runs at 5 or 10 degrees above the current max is not useful improvement. At an earlier job, I worked in a data center that had some 50 midrange and high-end Unix servers, and 200 or so PCs, 3 telecom switches, and 5 storage arrays totaling 300TB. Quite small by today's standards.

Thanks for your replies. Just a short reply:<br><br>I should clarify that I don't believe in a very high probability of having a long-term/permanent shortage of electricity availability. Electricity is extremely easy to make sustainably when the price is right (f.e. 2 or 3 times higher than the current price is more than enough to revolutionise electricity generation world wide within 20-30 years) and it is so crucial that consumers and producers will happily pay to get it, although they will complain. We may have electicity shortages in the short to medium term, but not long term. The problem is with oil supply. Liquid fuels. This has been discussed at length.<br><br>The ICE will be with us indefinately, because of it's low cost, low tech, and low/easy maintenance. When oil gets depleted, we will make synthetic- and bio-based oils. To be sure: The climate may change, the poor may starve: but ICE's are here to stay, and so are liquid fuels. (Unless there are major breakthrough in battery technology and/or hydrogen tech, which I don't expect. BTW. I'm betting on ICE's to take us at least through 2050)<br><br>Your right that IT doesn't bring me a hamburger or move goods, but it has myriad crucial selling points that make it a stayer, long-term.

I should have put it differently, because you are so correct: NOTHING should come ahead of food production.<br><br>I was speaking of communication and transport technologies. Maintaining the net should come ahead of maintaining our overscaled transport infrastructure. We don't, for example, need 10-lane double-decked expressways to maintain the electrical grid , and we need to make it possible to maintain the net in the face of grid breakdown. Hence the push by many municipalities to make wireless broadband accessible to everyone. Down the road we might have to be wireless or have very little electronic communication at all as the grid disintegrates. <br><br>Pursuant to that, we need to emphasize local power generation, and develop every generation technology that offers any potential, whether it's nuclear technologies that extend the fuel cycle; solar, water, wind, or cleaner coal technologies, while emphasizing conservation.<br><br>The net has the potential to be much more efficient than it is, by various means, as other posters in here have pointed out. We can't afford to scorn the efficiencies of the net or its efficient alternatives to our most wasteful activities. Most of all, it would be a sad loss to civilization to lose this powerful means of exchanging current information and linking far flung communities of people together.

You're certainly right that the net ought to be higher priority than new expressways, though if you want to talk about rebuilding America's rail network, that's another matter.

Somalia. <br><br>That's the lowest energy use, most chaotic place on the continent. Now, the locals aren't building and maintaining this infrastructure, but they're funding it with those cheap rates. So it shows what <i>may</i> be possible in a low-energy and low-organisation future. <br><br>They don't have internet access and streaming video. But they do have 11 FM radio stations and wide and cheap mobile phone coverage. <br><br>Likewise, in new states like East Timor, we find that they don't bother putting landlines in, but go straight for mobile phones - it's overall cheaper and requires less resources. And the mobile phone networks, being (largely) distributed networks (rather than One Big Facility) are quite resilient; a tower or two can go down and the rest take up the slack, with just a few dead spots. <br><br>Given that the infrastructure is built outside these countries and brought in, it seems more like some aspect of "the partial recovery during the general tumble down" JMG talks about. <br><br>Still, it's something to think about. It's not <i>either</i> broadband internet and mobile phones <i>or</i> horse-and-buggy carrying written mail. There are a lot of possibilities in between. It <i>may</i> be that some of them can be kept up in the long term, over centuries. <br><br>It may be, for example, that a town of a few thousand people could manufacture their own mobile towers, or some equivalent - not enough probably for everyone to have iPhones, but enough for them to have plain old talking phones.<br><br>I'm sure there are other possibilities people far more knowledgeable about telecommunications could suggest. I just point these out because it's what's actually happened. If you looked at Somalia, Timor and similar countries, you certainly wouldn't expect extensive and cheap mobile phone coverage there. <br><br>I find myself thinking of the article, <a href=http://fellowsblog.kiva.org/2009/04/16/a-study-in-contrasts-2/ rel=nofollow>"you have the internet but no running water?"</a> <br><br>Again, this could just be the slight pause in the steps down, or it could be something we could keep up long-term.

Saying "the net is so much more efficient than all of the flying around and driving around that would be needed to do the same things" is not an answer. When the power runs out, and the Internet is too expensive to maintain, then PEOPLE WILL STOP DOING THOSE THINGS. Yes, the economy will take a hit. Of course, the economy will have taken a huge hit long before then anyway.<br><br>And the idea that technology will magically fix everything, when we are coming up against the hard limits of the technology, like quantum field effects and gigahertz molecular resonance is just pathetic wishful thinking. Computer technology is at about the stage of development that internal combustion engines were in the '50s. Truly transformative technological development is, at this point, very, very unlikely. We might drive power efficiency up 50% in the next 20 years. That level of development won't rescue the Internet.<br><br>Telecom tech is even more mature. The last revolutionary advance was fibre-optic transmission which dates to the mid-60s. There's nothing in the pipeline to replace it. Cell phones, which are really just code-multiplexed spread-spectrum radios,were developed in the early '70s. Digital radio transmission allows more efficient use of the radio spectrum, but really has no effect on energy usage.<br><br>More than the actual power usage of the transmission network itself though, is the vast infrastructure required to maintain the networks. Most of the energy efficiencies gained in telecom in the last 30 years have been through the replacement of of older, bulkier, more power hungry devices with smaller, more integrated, more efficient devices. These smaller devices are more difficult to build, and require HUGE infrastructure investments, massive energy inputs, and a level of economic organization and activity that are quite unlikely to be maintained in an oil-depleted world. You can't keep open a 6nM chip fab selling hundreds of thousands of chips each year. If you could, you would have to charge hundreds of thousands of dollars per chip. The energy requirements to design improvements to your chips would even preclude the efficiency gains you hope to make.<br><br>It's appalling to me that tech people would not see the dependence of our technology on the level of social and economic organization that our society has achieved. That level of organization has come about through the exploitation of stored energy in the form of petroleum. <br><br>When I posted my first comment in this thread, I talked about water transport and trains, because I considered JMG's remarks on the future of the Internet to be totally unremarkable. I guess I was wrong on that score.<br><br><a href=end-of-information-age.html#c1616669922609624835 title="comment permalink">5/15/09, 8:56 PM</a><br><br>

Here we have nuclear fueled electricity and while it is cheap today, it is only because its cost is not payed upfront.

It conquered Siberia in the XVIIth century, before there was any railroad and there is no shortage of large state in the pre-industrial age (the Roman Empire, the Mings, the Maurya). I think that ideology and the ability to crush any rebellion is more important than quick transportation.<br><br>More to the point, I am a bit wary of predictions of such or such communication technology making obsolete such or such other communication technology.

It's a bit like asking an economist to notice that the natural cycles he dismisses as "externalities" are in fact the irreplaceable foundation of all economic activity. More generally, have you noticed just how many people commenting on the last two posts completely missed the economic dimension -- the core of the argument -- and insisted that because it's physically possible to keep, say, trains running, that they'll keep running? This kind of reflexive blind spot is one of the reasons I consider today's trust in progress a religion (or, if you will, a pseudoreligion) based on blind faith in emotionally compelling imagery. <br><br>Matthijs, thank you!

You might be interested in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=IE&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;v=KHGcvj3JiGA" rel=nofollow>this video</a>, especially the part around the 20-25 min marks. Here is a cursory transcript:<br><br>"There have been been crises of acceleration before in the last 150 years... One of them happened in the late 19th century... By that point, railroads and serious industrial manufacturing were in existence. People began to realize that they didn’t have a management structure to keep up with the production rate or growth of distributive networks... Vannevar Bush called it control crisis... Out of that crisis the modern corporation was born... By the 1920s, industry leaders began to realize that they are able to produce more goods than people actually want or need... They were discussing whether to slow down of find a way to stimulate people to buy more... and that gave the rise of advertising, as a way to keep the economic engine to move faster and faster..."<br><br>This gives reasons to generalize that the whole capitalistic model as we know it is utterly dependent on some growth (of production, consumption, stock markets or energy resources). Capitalism has yet to show how it can work decently when growth is obviously not possible. The collapsing phase might see virtually any economic activity unviable, in the sense that very few businesses could generate “worthy” profits. <br><br>I had some early experience of other economic model, the Soviet one. There is little good to say about it, though I did not face much of the often dramatized depressing facets either. But there were libraries even in villages, public transportation of various sorts, stringent education, basic health care, cheap recreation spots, and what not. Admittedly, most of the useful services, organizations, technologies were copied from the West, with a time lag of a decade or few. Maybe all that good was unsustainable, but the system got reformed and crumbled before we knew it. By now, libraries in villages are long gone, public transportation runs only on economically viable hours, recreation spots privatized, education dumbed-down, health care pretty depressing (with best doctors gone). And above that, the financial wonders of a few years ago turned into a nearly universal debt burden to (say) Scandinavian banks. The economic future of a prolonged downturn is now in the Eastern Europe.<br><br>I can foresee quite an irony of the capitalist versus socialist debates. The wealth/debt stratification will lead to quite feudal relations. Most essential goods or services will be basically monopolized locally, and along with renting that would be the only significantly profitable enterprises. The economy between the elites would look a lot like... communism; the lowly folks would do best avoiding paying rents and other forced payments as much as possible, and helping each other without significant monetary mediation.<br><br>The main point is that things like internet or railroads will survive not as viable enterprises, but as a hobby choice of some elites, or determined effort of enthusiasts or communities. It would be great if the standard of economic viability would be lowered to "getting about even" - the Socialist countries were not that far away from that management. Information technologies and railroads have a lot of synergy value; survival standards will depend a lot on where people's faith will lie.<br><br>As for preserving information, I mentioned two months ago here that perforated cards or tapes could be particularly durable. We may even start improving that technology (in density, or human-readable coding) now.<br><br><a href=end-of-information-age.html#c2922670919639411445 title="comment permalink">5/18/09, 3:37 AM</a><br><br>

First, not all hydroelectric facilities have a drop like Hoover Dam's; second, the mass of water behind the dam provides pressure, not just storage, so the amount of energy you can extract from it becomes much less.

The pressure at any point in a non-pressurized water system is always exactly equal to the weight of a column of water of the same horizontal area and height as the 1) area of interest and 2) difference between the height of the area of interest and the surface of the water subject to atmosphere. Plus the weight of a similar column of the atmosphere, but for electrical generation the weight of the air column is external to the calculation. Hence Snoqualmie Falls produces as much power per liter of water as Hoover Dam, despite the fact that the river is only 10 feet deep at the intake.<br><br>The purpose of a dam is to 1) raise the level of the water to a useful height for power generation 2) provide irrigation water for the lands that would normally be too far above the river 3) absorb water from rainy seasons for release in dry ones and 4) make a big ol' lake to play on. <br><br>For some projects (Pacific Power's South Umpqua Dam for instance) purposes 2 and 4 are not of interest, as there is already plenty of water and no convenient public access anyway.<br><br>Some power generation projects have their water intakes deep below the surface, so that they can continue generating even when the water level is seriously below normal. This is common where there is a lot of variability in river flow. In these cases, as the water level of the reservoir drops, the amount of power that can be extracted per liter drops as well.<br><br><a href=end-of-information-age.html#c2682718726706974000 title="comment permalink">5/18/09, 2:00 PM</a><br><br>

What will happen at the level of government is what has to happen in any "tragedy of the commons" situation. There will only be so much electricity to go around - it's use will have to be regulated. Getting rid of forced air HVAC will be a big move - replacing forced air heat with heated floor tiles increases the efficiency by several orders of magnitude and air-conditioning will be permitted probably only in hospitals or other industries where it is "necessary." Another thing to go would be home dryers for laundry. Even in winter clothes can be hung up to dry (we do it - though we do fluff the clothes in the dryer for 15 minutes or so when they're dry to activate the fabric softener. Modern softeners rely on heat. I presume the old kind will make a comeback at some point).

These are hugely complicated systems and some of the older ones are being mothballed rather than overhauled and put in continued operation. The Mid-Columbia dams are probably there to stay at any cost, but many hundreds of smaller dams will cost too much to keep running over the long haul.

No argument, though, that it will take a lot longer to drain Lake Michigan than the pipe. Second, the drop doesn't matter ( a lot); there are technologies such as Ossberger turbines that work well with low heads. Before they all got turned into hats, there were nine million beavers in North America making some hundreds of thousands of dams (http://www.permacultureactivist.net/articles/Beavers.htm).

I put it through a text editor in case some weird characters had snuck in and cut it into smaller posts.<br><br>Kiashu: “…it's worth noting that the cheapest mobile phone rates and best coverage in Africa are found in... Somalia.”<br><br>“Likewise, in new states like East Timor, we find that they don't bother putting landlines in, but go straight for mobile phones - it's overall cheaper and requires less resources. And the mobile phone networks, being (largely) distributed networks (rather than One Big Facility) are quite resilient; a tower or two can go down and the rest take up the slack, with just a few dead spots.”<br><br>Yes. That is what struck me: That the technology has now reached the stage where it is practical and affordable, even in such places.<br><br>They never have to be able to build such systems themselves from scratch; just support a world market big enough so that it is economical for the key system components to be built in a few places on earth, then shipped elsewhere for assembly in locally built towers.<br><br>Danby: “Computer technology is at about the stage of development that internal combustion engines were in the '50s. Truly transformative technological development is, at this point, very, very unlikely. We might drive power efficiency up 50% in the next 20 years. That level of development won't rescue the Internet.”<br><br>You might like to do a bit more research on this. There are a number of new technologies at various stages of development ranging from new manufacturing techniques that may reverse the trend of chip fabrication plants becoming ever more expensive and hard to build through to entirely new materials, perhaps the most promising being forms of carbon (never going to run out of that) that promise cheaper, faster (much faster) much more efficient chips.<br><br>In fact, there seems to be too many new technologies! They are jostling each other for limited research and development funds!<br><br>I doubt that digesting even these will be complete any time before well after the 2050s. Of course, if Quantum computers turn out to be buildable we may even be starting a new IT revolution with as long to run as the whole current computer business.<br><br>And all this is before we even begin to consider the impact of other probable near future developments such as the telecommunications holy grail of full optical switching. Just watch that one collapse electricity consumption in the industry.<br><br>Then there is the incredible bloated mess we call software. Sorting out and optimizing that horror should keep us busy and keep yielding improvements for at least three centuries.<br><br>Damien Perrotin: “…and by the way there is no breeder in France, the only one was closed down because it cost a lot and did not breed.”<br><br>Interesting! I was aware that breeder reactors are the worst of an expensive, dangerous, troublesome bunch and never likely to make economic sense as stand alone reactors, basically requiring a subsidy from the non-breeders they fuel, but I was not aware that France had closed its down.<br><br>But then, uranium continues to be amazingly cheap, so why bother with breeder reactors? Yes, I know there is all the fuss about it one day being relatively scarce and expensive, but for the moment it isn’t.<br><br>In fact, here in Australia it is almost a nuisance in some ore bodies, contaminating the copper, gold, silver or others metals they contain.<br><br>Interestingly, I was looking around a site (Energy from Thorium http://thoriumenergy.blogspot.com/) for historical stuff and was astonished to notice that much of the stuff the nuclear industry is squabbling about now, they were squabbling about in the 1970s and before. Seems they are just going around in circles.<br><br>But then, what else would you expect from an industry that fell off the back of the atomic bomb project.<br><br><a href=end-of-information-age.html#c2111378718321930065 title="comment permalink">5/20/09, 3:14 AM</a><br><br>

It will in fact make enormous economic and social, and yes political and military sense to keep them running.<br><br>I’d suggest that some research into railways in the nineteenth and first half of the twentieth century, especially on frontiers and places like India and China would give a better idea of the practicality of operating railways in relatively low tech, resource poor regions and of the enormous, transformative effect they had on economies and peoples’ lives.<br><br>Actually, if things turn out anything like you expect, the two current systems I would most expect to not merely survive but thrive would be railways and telecommunications/computers.

<div class="avtb a_61c74c" id=c1715913073937447166></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/02333438671130100114 rel=nofollow>Bill Pulliam</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Interesting the places these comment threads wind up by the end of the week!<br><br>Hydro and beavers:<br><br>First, all the statements about pressure being dependent only on the depth of the water are true when you are talking about hydroSTATIC pressure -- i.e. water than is not moving. As soon the water begins to move, like when you turn on the hydro turbines, the situation changes. Then the shapes of things and paths of water flow matter quite a bit. This is why flushing the toilet scalds the person in the shower if your plumbing system isn't designed well. There is much more to fluid DYNAMICS than hydroSTATIC pressure. <br><br>Next, about beavers. They are doing a pretty good job of reintroducing themselves across much of North America. I share my farm with a very industrious pair. Until last week when the biggest flash flood in several decades blasted the stream channel clean, our creek was a continuous series of ponds making it a long skinny lake. This brings up a critical point: beaver dams are also DYNAMIC, unlike the STATIC dams that people construct. A small human-constructed dam does not at all duplicate the ecological function of a beaver dam. It creates a permanent barrier to migration of stream fauna and movement of stream sediment and particulate organic matter. The shoreline and altered water table it produces are fixed in place. Beaver dams are transitory things. The floods sweep them away, the beavers shift their home ranges (or die) and abandon old ones while building new ones, the ponds are always moving around. This creates a mosaic in time and space of habitats, incuding open water, filling in marshes, shrubby bogs, and lots of standing dead trees. It also allows for movement of aquatic animals upstream and downstream as the dams come and go. This is the environment that the wetland flora and fauna of BeaverLand evolved with and is adapted to. Static dams don't even create an approximation to this unless you are willing to tear them down and rebuild them in new locations at irregular intervals every few months or years. Recently I've begun to think that maybe the drastic 19th Century declines of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker and Bachman's Warbler were due as much to the elimination of beavers as the other more frequently cited causes.<br><br>So in short, don't use the fantasy that you are somehow duplicating a beaver as a warm-fuzzy-feel-good rationalization for damming up your streams. If you do dam your streams and you want to feel good about it ecologically, you will still have to build in mitigating systems to allow the animals to move upstream and the sediment and organic matter to move downstream. Or dynamite your damn every year or so (preferably during a flood) then rebuild it in a different location!<br><br><a href=end-of-information-age.html#c1715913073937447166 title="comment permalink">5/20/09, 6:23 AM</a><br><br>

When cooling and auxiliary infrastructure are included, that number grows to 1.2%, an amount comparable to that for color televisions.

My AP summer homework just never goes away, even when I get online for a break!<br><br>Our homework is to read Friedman's latest: <i>Hot, Flat and Crowded</i>, which is more or less speaking about the same things as you have in this post (I found a link to this post from twitter and have no background as to the rest of your blog) -- with one difference-- Friedman refers to what is happening as moving into the Energy-Climate Era, or the ECE for short. <br><br>His book, if you have not read it, spends about two hundred pages describing what exactly we're doing to destroy our world and then another two hundred pages on what we need to do to fix it, and many of his main points directly addressed the issues of energy (or lack of). One of the main recommendations is that we need to continue pushing (through government and businesses alike) for innovation while we create a new system of energy dispersal-- because as Friedman points out, the current system of utilities is <i>incredibly</i> inefficient, especially when working to transport energy from one place to another. ex) moving electricity produced by the wind turbines in northern Arizona to southern California<br><br>Many ideas for the new system and for energy efficiency are detailed in the tenth chapter: <i>The Energy Internet: When IT meets ET</i>. <br><br>Overall, if interested in this subject, I found the book quite interesting. A tad on the repetitive side, and cramming it all into one week of stressful homework finishing at the end of the summer was probably a bad idea, but I'd still recommend it :]<br><br><a href=end-of-information-age.html#c1581479563883708428 title="comment permalink">8/30/09, 8:45 AM</a><br><br>

Peak coal and peak uranium. The principle thing preventing move to breeder reactors isn't technological. It's political. For the US peak coal is far more of a big deal immediately. Yet no-one is talking about it. <br><br>With regards of uranium, the technology is there for 'sustainable' nuclear power - the by-product is potentially massive proliferation of fuel for nuclear weapons. Japan have thought ahead. In the absence of politically tricky (harbingers of mass proliferation) breeder-type reactors seawater extraction becomes economic as traditional reserves are squeezed.<br><br>These are not limits, rather signifiers of politicians facing a public that would not accept grown up choices until they're faced with them. <br><br>Peak coal is an immediate big deal.
