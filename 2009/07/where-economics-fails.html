It’s occurred to me more than once that we might be wise to set aside an annual weekend to mourn the death of Osiris or Persephone or Bladud the wind-god or some other divinity, as our pagan ancestors did, or as those Christians who still take the narratives of their faith seriously do each year on Good Friday. It might at least put a merciful end to the media’s frantic and macabre efforts to bestow a belated sainthood on each new member of the dead celebrities’ club, no matter how far from sanctity the trajectory of their lives might have been.<br><br>Thus you’d be correct in guessing that I didn’t put much time this past weekend into paying attention to the media furore over the death of Michael Jackson. I was, instead, busy with my usual research. While tens of millions of people spent the weekend glued to their TVs reviewing the catastrophic fall from grace of an undeniably brilliant cultural phenomenon that achieved unparalleled success, and then was brought down by a supertanker-sized load of unresolved inner conflicts heated to crisis by a disastrous mismatch between an extravagant lifestyle and faltering income – well, I suppose that’s a fair description of what I was doing, too.<br><br>Still, the decline and fall of industrial civilization, that troubled and dysfunctional superstar still wobbling across the historical stage, can’t be tracked that effectively by taking in music videos or soundbite interviews. Instead, I spent the weekend reading through economics textbooks. “Thriller” is not exactly the word I’d use to describe these hefty tomes, but I’d recommend that anyone concerned with the future of our society ought to read at least one. This is not because current economic textbooks offer useful guidance to the challenges of our time. Quite the contrary; the world they describe is as imaginary as Oz, and rather less relevant to contemporary life. What makes them important is precisely that so many of the decision makers of our time treat this fantasy as reality.<br><br>Understand current economic thought and you understand most of the mistakes that are dragging industrial civilization down to ruin. The Energy Information Administration (EIA), a branch of the US government, has become infamous in the peak oil scene over the last decade or so for publishing estimates of future petroleum production that have no relationship to geological reality. Their methodology, as described in EIA publications, was simply to estimate probable increases in demand, and then to assume that increased demand would automatically be met with a corresponding increase in supply. Quite a few peak oil writers have suggested some dark conspiracy behind this blithe disregard for the limits of a finite planet, but it takes only a few minutes’ worth of reading to identify the real culprit as the standard notion of the law of supply and demand taught in every first-year economics textbook today.<br><br>According to this model of the world, the amount of any commodity available in a free market is controlled by the demand for that commodity. When consumers want more of a commodity than is available on the market, and are willing to pay more for it, the price of the commodity goes up; this provides an economic incentive for producers to produce more of the commodity, and so the amount of the commodity on the market goes up. Increased production sets an upper limit on price increases, since producers competing against one another will cut prices to gain market share, and the willingness of consumers to pay rising prices is also limited. Thus, in theory, the production and price of a commodity are set by a shifting balance between the desire of consumers to buy it and the desire of producers to make a profit from producing it.<br><br>What makes the theory so seductive is that within certain limits, and in certain circumstances, it works tolerably well. The problem creeps in when economists lose track of the existence of those limits and circumstances, and this, to a remarkable degree, is exactly what they have done. To be fair, they had good reason to do so, because during the three-hundred-year boom that created the industrial world following the successful harnessing of fossil fuels, the limits rarely applied and the circumstances were far more often present than not. Among the most important roots of the current crisis, in turn, are the hard facts that the limits have begun to come into play, and the circumstances no longer exist.<br><br>Let’s start with the obvious. Imagine that a plane full of investment bankers makes a forced landing in the Pacific close to a desert island. The island has no food, no water, and no shelter; it’s just a bare lump of rock and sand with a few salt-tolerant grasses on it. As the bankers struggle ashore from the sinking plane, the need for food, water, and shelter on that island is going to be considerable, but even if each of the bankers have a suitcase full of $134 billion dollars in bearer bonds – like those guys who were caught trying to enter Switzerland a little while back – that need is going to go unfilled, until and unless a ship arrives from somewhere else. The lesson here is simple: economics doesn’t trump physical reality.<br><br>More generally, the theoretical relationship between supply and demand functions only when supply is not constrained by factors outside the economic sphere. The constraints in question can be physical: no matter how much money you’re willing to pay for a perpetual motion machine, for instance, you can’t have one, because the laws of thermodynamics don’t take bribes. They may be political: Nazi Germany had a large demand for oil from 1943 to 1945, for example, and the Allies had plenty of oil to sell, but anyone who assumed on that basis that a deal would be cut was in for a big disappointment. They may be technical: no matter how much you spend on health care, for instance, sooner or later it’s going to fail, because nobody’s yet been able to develop an effective treatment for death. Economists have come up with various workarounds to deal with external factors of this sort, some more convincing than others.<br><br>Another set of factors that can crumple up the law of supply and demand and toss it into the wastebasket, though, has received far less attention. These are constraints that we might as well call “ecological,” and they unfold from the awkward fact that human economic activity is far less independent of the natural world than economists often try to pretend. The scale of this dependence is as rarely recognized as it is hard to overstate. One of the few attempts to quantify it, an attempt to work out the replacement costs for natural services carried out a few years back by a team headed by heretical economist Robert Costanza, came up with a midrange figure equal to around three times the gross domestic product of all human economic activity on earth.<br><br>Out of every dollar of value circulating in the world’s economy, in other words, something like 75 cents were provided by natural processes rather than human labor. What’s more, most if not all of that 75 cents of value had to be there in advance in order for the production of the other 25 cents to be possible at all. Before you can begin farming, for example, you need to have arable soil, water, and an adequate growing season, as well as more specialized natural services such as pollination. These are nonnegotiable requirements; if you don’t have them, you can’t farm. The same is true of every other kind of productive work in the human economy: nature’s contribution comes first, and generally determines how much the human economy can produce.<br><br>It’s for this reason that E.F. Schumacher, the maverick economist whose ideas are the launching pad for this series of posts, drew a hard distinction between what he called primary goods and secondary goods. Secondary goods are the goods and services provided by human labor, the ordinary subject of economic theory. Primary goods are the goods and services provided by nature, and they make the production of secondary goods possible. The difference between the two is very much like the difference between income and profit in a business: you have to have income in order to have profit, and if you neglect income while maximizing your profit, sooner or later you go bust.<br><br>A failure to distinguish between primary and secondary goods is at the root of a great deal of current economic nonsense. It’s usually possible, for example, to substitute one secondary good for another if the supply runs short or the price gets too high, and for this reason it’s a standard assumption of economics – and one of the foundations of the law of supply and demand – that consumers can meet their needs equally well with many different goods. <i>Yet this assumption does not apply to natural goods.</i> In the world of nature, a different rule – Liebig’s law of the minimum – applies instead: production is limited by the scarcest necessary resource. Thus if you have a farm and can’t get water for your crops, it doesn’t matter if you have excellent soil and all the other requisites of farming; you can’t grow anything.<br><br>In certain limited situations, to be sure, it’s possible to substitute one primary good for another – for instance, to use low-grade iron ores such as taconite when the high-grade ores have been exhausted. Even when this can be done, though, a law of diminishing returns always applies. You can get iron out of low-grade ore, but the extraction process is less efficient and takes much larger inputs of energy. When energy is cheap, you can ignore this – and this is exactly what happened over the course of the 20th century, as the iron industry retooled itself to use steadily lower grades of ore and steadily larger inputs of energy – but that in itself simply passes costs onto the future, since the fossil fuels that provided the energy inputs are themselves subject to depletion, and to a law of diminishing returns. One way or another, the substitution imposes additional costs without providing any additional economic benefit.<br><br>This same rule also applies to every other natural good. Consider the valuable service provided to the world’s economies by the honeybees that pollinate most nongrain food crops. If we succeed in adding the honeybee to the already long list of the world’s extinct life forms, it would doubtless be possible to replace their pollination services by other means, whether that took the form of huge pollinating machines rumbling across the fields or the simpler and probably more economical approach of migrant workers using little brushes to wipe pollen from a bag onto the stamen of every single flower. Note, though, that no farmer in his or her right mind would hire a thousand laborers with brushes instead of calling up the local beekeeper and arranging for a few hives to be left in the fields; substituting some other pollination method for bees would add a huge additional cost to farming, without yielding any additional benefit.<br><br>I’ve come to think that the unrecognized difference between secondary goods, which can be readily replaced by other goods without additional cost, and primary goods, which cannot, is among the most important forces driving our current crisis. For the last three centuries, the industrial economies of the world have been using up every primary good that can be converted into secondary goods at extravagant and steadily increasing rates. Think of any good or service provided by nature – from topsoil to oceanic fish stocks, from the pollution-absorbing capacities of rivers to the storm-buffering properties of wetlands, from breathable air and drinkable water to the mineral stocks and fossil fuel reserves that keep the entire system running – and you’ve just identified something that’s being used up rapidly by industrial societies, with no thought of the potential costs of substituting something else for it, much less of the hard fact that nothing we can possibly do can provide a substitute for some of them once they’re gone.<br><br>The mismatch between this hopelessly shortsighted approach and the unforgiving limits of nature is imposing a rising toll of substitution costs on industrial economies around the world. Of course there are other factors involved. Still, as I hope to show in a future post, the best explanation for the “stagflation” that beset economies and baffled economists in the 1970s was the unrecognized burden of substitution costs for a range of natural goods depleted or damaged during the previous decades. Equally, the economic dysfunctions that led central banks around 2002 to flood financial markets with cheap credit – a disastrous decision that ended up powering the boom and bust that landed us in the current Great Recession – were driven by mounting substitution costs for another range of natural goods that had been depleted or overused in the previous decades of prosperity. As peak oil adds a new round of substitution costs to those already in play, this same process is likely to have even more dramatic impacts on the future.

It's just misunderstood.<br><br> All that law states is that a decreasing supply or an increasing demand will drive up the price to a point of equilibrium, where the demand meets the supply, due to the complex of both demand destruction and supply increase which higher prices produce. Conversely it teaches that increasing supply or decreasing demand will drive prices down to the point where equilibrium is again reached by driving production down or encouraging demand via lower prices. The idea that the market will magically generate goods to meet any demand is not actually part of the law of supply and demand, although it seems popular with free-market absolutists and the Austrians (or do I repeat myself?).<br><br><a href=where-economics-fails.html#c6508222526304393653 title="comment permalink">7/2/09, 12:10 AM</a><br><br>

Then I read my fresh copy of The Long Descent. You paint at least a dim hope for the future that I have gotten behind and started making some substantial changes in my material and psychological worlds.

But much of what you say in this post implies that the first drop is likely to be very steep and very chaotic indeed, because maintaining "growth"--however one defines that--upon an ever-dwindling resource base of ever poorer quality supplies that are ever-more difficult to reach has required modern commercial civilization to raise up ever more complex and tenuous systems, like the medievals piling additional levels upon the foundation of a Roman aqueduct to supply ever larger populations. Such a system becomes so brittle that it only has to fail at one point, anywhere along its length, and suddenly we go from having a great deal of water to having none at all. The remote, low-quality resources cannot be put to use without the peak of technology, now unavailable. The water table has dropped to low to be hand-pumped; the remaining oil is under the deep ocean and no one can maintain an offshore rig or keep tankers in repair. Every system breaks down at once, and where is the bottom? This implies the catastrophic, near instantaneous end to all civilization and the resulting "Mad Max" years that you have asserted are modern fantasies. Have you become more pessimistic?<br><br><a href=where-economics-fails.html#c2520521636378097997 title="comment permalink">7/2/09, 12:21 PM</a><br><br>

To borrow an electronic metaphor, it's like the way that changes in grid current affect plate current in a vacuum tube; it's a very straightforward linear relationship, except when it isn't. <br><br>Nnonnth, the New Right of the 1980s was able to end the stagflation of the Seventies by flooding the world with cheap oil from the North Slope and North Sea reserves, which had just been brought into production. I'll be talking later on about the way that energy resources are to other primary goods as primary goods are to secondary goods. It was a cheap temporary fix; too bad its long-term effect was to leave the world up the creek without a paddle. <br><br>Eric, you get one free spam post like this; any further posts need to contribute to the conversation, or they won't get put through. <br><br>Eremon, it's going to be a rough time, no question, but those who prepare for hard times will have a tolerably good chance of coming through it with their humanity intact, and bringing through the best parts of our cultural heritage as well. <br><br>Joel, your crystal ball is working well, I see. I'll be arguing later on that those societies that adopt a more sane and ecological vision of economics are going to have huge advantages in the struggle for survival opening around us right now. <br><br>Coyote, I have a deeply ingrained skepticism about the value of moral pronouncements; their track record as a means of causing change is, well, abysmal. (Moral behavior is what we all know we ought to do, while we're doing something else.) Thus it's crucial to point out that ecological sanity is a practical necessity for survival, without dragging in the moral dimension. <br><br>Shark, actually, I'd disagree that the points made in this post support the claim of a catastrophic collapse. They're simply the reasons why decline is inevitable -- one shortage can be worked around, but an interwoven pattern of shortages effecting nearly all primary goods is beyond anyone's capacity to fix. That doesn't mean the impact of those shortages will hit all at once -- quite the contrary, it suggests to me a death of a thousand cuts, dragged out over a substantial period. <br><br>Beetle, it's one of the ironies of history that the people responsible for most of our species' really awful decisions rarely hang around to see the consequences. Of course the same thing is true of good decisions, too.<br><br><a href=where-economics-fails.html#c8230987200631060244 title="comment permalink">7/2/09, 1:11 PM</a><br><br>

The first conclusion is that it's an abstract representation but that just begs the question: What does it represent? It doesn't represent anything physical - 1914 and the beginning of WW1 saw the end of the Gold Standard that had been in place for about 20 years (It had been an absolute failure BTW). It didn't represent Labour, if it did then everyone would be paid the same as Marx said - An hours work for an hours work.<br><br>In theory it represents some sort of value but how was that value defined? As it happens, the value that money represents is entirely dependent upon who happens to be holding the money at the time. A hundred dollars to someone with millions in the bank doesn't represent much but to the person who's looking to it to supply his food for the next month it represents much.<br><br>So, the answer I got was: Money, an abstract representation of perceived value.<br><br>This is interesting because one of the things it seems to me that economists do is to view money as THE primary resource. ie, If you have enough money you can do anything you want. Actual supply of resources isn't questioned but taken for granted.<br><br>This is, of course, delusional. Sooner or later, no matter how much money the banks print, with the way we're going their won't be any resources left to buy.<br><br><a href=where-economics-fails.html#c902417898045045227 title="comment permalink">7/4/09, 7:17 AM</a><br><br>

Great brain-food you're feeding us here. I'm a student of complex systems, trying to model a range of adaptive 'social technologies' we might need in the coming years. As part of this, I've dug into a fair bit of economics. I do agree with much of what you say, but feel a little protective of economists. Yes, it has severe problems, but it also has many uses.<br><br>As the first commenter pointed out, supply and demand is only a model. It seems to me you're not distinguishing models and the uses to which they are put. Any good economist knows the limits of their theory. E.g. read <a href=http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/dishpan.html rel=nofollow>this by Krugman</a> and <a href=http://www.amazon.co.uk/Soulful-Science-Economists-Really-Matters/dp/0691125139 rel=nofollow>this wonderful book</a> that takes apart some of the criticisms thrown at economics 101.<br><br>Models can be used by powerful people as a figleaf of mathematical respectability to hide a political motive. But this doesn't mean the models are useless. Indeed, supply and demand has the advantage of being intuitively so useful that it helps shed light on the peak oil issue for anyone - dwindling supply will increase the cost as the same amount of money chases less goods. You're right - the problem is clearly much larger than this simple economic insight - but this doesn't lessen the usefulness of that insight. <br><br>A famous quote: "The master's tools will never dismantle the master's house. They may allow us temporarily to beat him at his own game, but they will never enable us to bring about genuine change." (Audre Lorde)<br><br>This is absolutely wrong. I can see why people think it - one doesn't want to be tainted with methods used by bankers even now laughing their socks off as they get back to business-as-usual, having fleeced governments to keep them alive. But economics has useful tools we will need - and we need to be wombles, making good use of the things that we find, if we're going to survive.<br><br>A little warily, in case you think it's spam, <a href=http://www.coveredinbees.org/node/259 rel=nofollow>here's a recent post of mine</a> on 'adaptive landscapes' used by three societies - entirely different approaches to managing scarce resources with a proven record of working. I think it's this sort of thing that we'll need (I'm building computer models of this stuff) - but we'll also need economics.<br><br><a href=where-economics-fails.html#c7269689126570454498 title="comment permalink">7/6/09, 4:04 PM</a><br><br>
