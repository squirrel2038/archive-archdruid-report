<span style=font-size:130%>The Bomb at the Heart of the System</span><br><br>The outcome of the Copenhagen climate change talks last week could not have been better suited to illustrate the points I have been trying to make in the last two posts. After all the high hopes and overheated rhetoric, as I (and of course a great many other people) predicted some time ago, what remains in place as the dust settles is business as usual.<br><br>The United States and China, who head the main power blocs in the negotiations and also generate more CO2 than anyone else, minted a toothless accord that furthers nobody’s interests but theirs, and proceeded to tell the rest of the world to like it or lump it. A few climate activists are still gamely trying to find grounds for hope in the accord; others are shrilly accusing Barack Obama of betraying the messianic expectations they projected onto him; and a certain amount of stunned silence, in response to the failure of climate activism to have the slightest effect on the proceedings, is also being heard.<br><br>It’s probably worth pointing out that the results would not have differed noticeably if John McCain had won last November’s election. The consensus that has been fixed in place since Ronald Reagan’s first term, in other words, still dominates American politics. Despite increasingly desperate efforts on the part of both mainstream parties to appeal to an increasingly disaffected electorate via increasingly overheated rhetoric, it takes a micrometer to measure concrete differences in policy between the parties. Each party has its captive constituencies, to which it makes appropriate noises come election time; Republicans claim they want to ban abortion, Democrats claim they want to protect the environment, but neither party ever gets around to turning any of this talk into action.<br><br>The most popular explanation for all this relies on the sheer hypocrisy of politicians, and such a case is not too hard to make, not least because it’s rare for politicians to be any more ethical than the people they represent. Some versions of the case insist that politicians are cynical beasts who are in it purely for the money, and find shilling for various corrupt interests more lucrative than serving the public. Other versions, in the ascendant these days, insist that politicians are puppets of some sinister elite pursuing a totalitarian agenda, and then try to find reasons why every turn of events furthers that agenda.<br><br>Now of course it’s tolerably easy to find examples that can be used to support these claims. Some politicians are blatantly corrupt and self-serving; others just as blatantly put the interests of their allies in the business world ahead of the people they are supposed to serve. It furthers many political narratives to portray the situation as an episode of <i>Dudley Do-Right</i>, with some wicked elite or other in the role of Snidely Whiplash, tying the American people to the train tracks, as Dudley Do-Right scoops up an armload of protest signs and position papers and gallops off to the rescue. Still, I’m by no means certain this is really all there is to the matter. <br><br>The counterexample that comes to mind is Afghanistan, and specifically Obama’s decision to send another 30,000 troops (and an undisclosed number of “civilian contractors,” the modern military version of disposable temp labor) into that quagmire. To call this decision self-defeating is to understate matters considerably. Afghanistan is where empires go to die; the debacle of the Russian occupation a few years back was only the latest in a long and unbroken history of failed attempts to conquer Afghanistan. Not even Alexander the Great managed the trick, and whatever the personal qualities of the airbrushed machine politician in the Oval Office and the camo-clad bureaucrat who manages his war might be, I confess to a reasonable doubt that anybody in the future will call them Obama or McChrystal the Greater.<br><br>Leave aside moral issues for a moment, and it’s tolerably clear that only two strategies could prevent total US failure in Afghanistan. The first is to reinstate the draft, conscript half a million new soldiers, shift the US economy over to a wartime footing, and go into Afghanistan with the same overwhelming force the Chinese deployed successfully on similar terrain in Tibet. The other is to declare a victory and get out. Any other choice means the United States will keep on spending money it doesn’t have and prestige it can’t spare on a war it isn’t going to win.<br><br>I doubt that any of this is invisible to the experienced military planners in the Pentagon, or the politicians who give them their marching orders. Why, then, the futile gesture?<br><br>The hard fact of the matter is that neither of the two potentially successful strategies is politically possible to an American government today. Exemption from forced military service was part of the price the American middle class exacted in exchange for their abandonment of the radicalism of the 1960s, and no politician is willing to risk the backlash that would follow an attempt to tamper with that bargain. Furthermore, it’s by no means certain that America has the economic strength left to fight a real war at this point, and it’s not hard to name hostile powers who would be happy to use any such opportunity to push us over the edge into national bankruptcy.<br><br>Declaring a victory and getting out is a good deal more viable, and it’s the option that Obama’s successor in 2013 will likely be forced to embrace. Accepting it now, though, would offend many constituencies, not all of which have financial motives for supporting the war, and it would require America to give up on intervening in the Great Game of geopolitics now being played in central Asia – a goal many factions in the American political class are unready to abandon.<br><br>Behind the decision to send an inadequate force to prop up a losing struggle, in other words, lies the complex nature of political power in contemporary America. A great many people nowadays seem to think that because they don’t have the power to impose their agendas on the country, someone else must have that power, and the increasingly self-defeating decisions coming out of Washington must result from deliberate policy on the part of that someone else. Comforting as that belief may be, the facts don’t support it. A century of political reforms have diffused power so broadly in American society that no one group has a monopoly on power, and any group of would-be leaders has to build alliances and garner support among a great many independent centers of power with agendas of their own.<br><br>Now of course it’s quite true, as the left is fond of pointing out, that a great many of these power centers are interested primarily in pursuing their own interests, and are perfectly willing to do it at the expense of the common good. It’s also true that this indictment can be applied to the left as much as to the right. Still, behind the inevitable chicanery found across the political spectrum lies the insoluble dilemma in which the American political system has been caught since the 1970s – the inevitable failure of government by pork barrel in an age of decline.<br><br>Like most of the nations that call themselves representative democracies these days, America operates by means of a system not too different from the one that graced, if that’s the right word, the twilight years of the Roman Republic. The ultimate mandate for power comes from popular vote, and so every possible means is used to make sure elections come out as desired. Vote fraud is one such means; propaganda is another; but the most effective is to buy the loyalty of voting blocs with cold hard cash. From defense spending to entitlements to economic stimulus programs, that’s the name of the game, and it pays off handsomely come election time.<br><br>There are, however, at least two massive problems with this sort of pork-fed politics. First, the number of groups to be placated tends to rise as the size of the pork barrel increases. In today’s America, any group that can organize and raise money effectively enough to influence elections can usually elbow its way to a place at the feeding trough. (That today’s radicals of left and right alike are, by and large, inept at organizing and fundraising goes a long way to explain their insistence that power is being kept out of their hands by a malevolent elite.) It’s not hard to respond to a changing world when the interests that have to sign on to policy changes are few and clearly defined, as they were fifty years ago, but it becomes much harder when power is diffused through scores of competing factions, and it takes an alliance of a dozen disparate interest groups to get anything done at all.<br><br>This happens in the life of nearly all republics, and it plays an important role in the political breakdowns that afflict them at regular intervals. Still, another factor will be familiar to regular readers of this blog: the mismatch between growth and the limits of the environment that provides the basis for growth. In societies that use resources at a steady rate, those limits are always close at hand, and struggles between interest groups over the distribution of pork are recognized as zero-sum games, in which somebody has to lose for somebody else to gain; thus the multiplication of factions tends to be limited by the fixed size of the feeding trough.<br><br>In a society that relies on rapidly expanding production of resources, on the other hand, this can be evaded for a time. The first two-thirds of the 20th century thus saw an explosion of factions that spanned the entire upper half of the American class structure, from the ultrarich to unionized labor. The result was a vast number of people who all expected to get financial benefits from the government. Yet the end of America’s real economic expansion in the 1970s meant that these demands had to be paid out of a dwindling supply of real wealth. <br><br>One result has been a drastic narrowing of the options available to politicians. A great many simple and necessary reforms that could be enacted without harm to anyone – for example, putting a means test on social security pensions – are completely off the table, because nobody can put together a governing coalition without the support of groups that oppose such measures. Equally, a great many ghastly policies – for example, deliberately inflating financial bubbles – have become political necessities, because they allow governments to get away with the pretense of paying off their supporters. Meanwhile any sector of society not organized enough to defend its interests can basically count on being thrown to the wolves.<br><br>The rising spiral of crises that threaten the survival of industrial society might be expected to trump such matters. The problem here, of course, is that prophecies of imminent doomsday have been standard political theater in American public life for more than a century, and most people in politics have long since stopped listening to them. There are plenty of people in politics who still remember, for example, the widespread insistence that the energy crisis of the 1970s was supposed to be permanent; the fact that there were plenty of less shrill predictions that have proven to be much more accurate in retrospect is nothing like as memorable.<br><br>Behind all of this lies the central political fact of the limits to growth: the reduction of First World nations to a Third World lifestyle that will be the inevitable result of any transition to a postpetroleum world, whether that transition is deliberate or unplanned. Metaphors about elephants in living rooms don’t begin to touch the political explosiveness of this fact, or the degree to which people at every point on the political spectrum have tried to pretend that it just isn’t so. Still, set aside delusions about miraculous new energy sources that show up basically because we want them to, and it’s impossible to evade.<br><br>Let’s walk through the logic. The most reasonable estimates suggest that, given a crash program and the best foreseeable technologies, renewable sources can probably provide the United States with around 15% of the energy it currently gets from fossil fuels. Since every good and service in the economy is the product of energy, it’s a very rough but functional approximation to say that in a green economy, every American will have to get by on the equivalent of 15% of his or her current income. Take a moment to work through the consequences in your own life; if you made $50,000 in 2009, for example, imagine having to live on $7,500 in 2010. That’s quite a respectable income by Third World standards, but it won’t support the kind of lifestyle that the vast majority of Americans, across the political spectrum, believe is theirs by right.<br><br>That’s the bomb ticking away at the heart of America’s political system. When it goes off, the entire system of government by pork barrel will explode messily, and it’s only in the fantasies of reformers that what replaces it will likely be an improvement. (My guess? Anything from a military coup followed, after various convulsions, by a new and less centralized constitution, to civil war and the partition of the United States into half a dozen impoverished and quarreling nations.) In the meantime, we can expect to see every possible short term expedient put to use in an attempt to stave off the explosion even for a little while, and any measure that might risk rocking the boat enough to set off the bomb will be quietly roundfiled by all parties.<br><br>A meaningful political response to the growing instability of global climate is one such measure, and a meaningful political response to peak oil is another. No such project can be enacted without redirecting a great deal of money and resources away from current expenditures toward the construction of new infrastructure. The proponents of such measures are quick to insist that this means new jobs will be created, and of course this is true, but they neglect to mention that a great many more existing jobs will go away, and the interests that presently lay claim to the money and resources involved are not exactly eager to relinquish those. A political system of centralized power could overcome their resistance readily enough, but a system in which power is diffused and fragmented cannot do so. That the collapse of the entire system is a likely long-term consequence of this inability is simply one of the common ironies of history.

This small group of people is easily identifiable and their power is not hard to see. The media is now owned by the Wall St Ghouls. They have turned it into a lie machine and and use it to keep our politicians in check. The Wall St Ghouls control of the treasury and the FED along with the media have our politicians against a rock and a hard place.<br><br>The Wall St Ghouls come from a certain sub-culture in the USA but if you mention that you are called all kinds of names and all the facts are forgotten. This subset also controls book publishing in the USA so that might explain your reluctance to tell the truth. <br><br>Not long ago you posted about a energetic president villifying Islam in an attempt to push fascism. We have already went down that road with GWB and the people did not swallow it. Arabs have not used the central banks to enrich themselves buy up the media and then usurp our gov't. The people are starting to wake up to which "religion" has. <br><br>I believe you are correct that the USA is in danger of a leader leading us down the road to ugliness but it will be the usual suspects paying the price for what looks more and more to be their usual crimes. Not Islam. All the suppossed "myths" that happened in the past don't look like myths anymore to me. <br><br>I know you won't post this and will likely pretend I am wrong but you are too smart not too see it as clearly as I do. On this subject you throw logic out the window in favor of vauge references like the one about how power is so decentralized in this country. The power in this country flows from a few Wall St banks. these banks usurpation of our gov't is complete. The people at these banks who have done this can be easily named. I understand you don't want to shoot your book deals in the foot by challenging them but you really should stop carrying their water by claiming they don't exist. It is making you look foolish.<br><br><a href=political-ecology-of-collapse-part.html#c5508995677686890348 title="comment permalink">12/23/09, 8:54 PM</a><br><br>

As a U.S. retiree living in Canada, my partner keeps telling me that my Postal and VA retirements are not going to be around. As I've told her, when that happens, very little else will be working very well either! My current retirement income is about 45% of my old salary, so I'm on my way to that 15%. LOL! We're doing the chickens, goats, and small farm thing anyway. Maybe that will see us through a few such years. Maybe not! LOL! Besides, if we're all in the same boat, why complain? It's when so many seem to have so much, and you may have so little, it magnifies what you don't have...<br><br><a href=political-ecology-of-collapse-part.html#c425639208274120636 title="comment permalink">12/23/09, 8:59 PM</a><br><br>

Shiner, I'm quite aware -- and in fact, I referred to the point in my post -- that a lot of people prefer hunting scapegoats to grappling with the much less cartoonish realities of life in a failing republic. The reason I don't spread those same popular misconceptions is that I don't find conspiracy thinking (with or without your lightly veiled anti-Semitism) either accurate or useful. <br><br>Hapibeli, nicely put. <br><br>Prizm, good. You're getting the point. <br><br>Patz, it's hardly a paradox. First, most of that money doesn't actually exist; factor out the imaginary wealth manufactured out of thin air by way of derivatives and the like, and the apparent "transfer of wealth" is vastly smaller than it seems to be. Second, it's precisely because power has become so diffuse that a range of wealthy interests have been able to cash in to the extent they have -- since their existing wealth gives them political clout, they can hold a dysfunctional system to ransom, and of course they do. Can they control the system in any more direct sense? I don't think so -- and I think we'll find the unraveling of the American political system will put most of them up against the wall, and not necessarily in any metaphorical sense, either.<br><br><a href=political-ecology-of-collapse-part.html#c9055707660003231245 title="comment permalink">12/23/09, 10:03 PM</a><br><br>

I suppose that you are right that pointing out that Jews, as a whole, are not Semites or moral paragons is not particularly useful.

It is at odds with too many critical lobbying groups.<br><br>I think you have painted an accurate picture as to the future of the United States. When things start to get desperate via unemployment, food, water issues, what have you... the federal gov or some other agency will try to re-concentrate political power.

The US got quite into the habit of fighting "unwinnable" wars - still at good unquestionable profit for some.

It is a matter of being in power to do some "natural" selection.<br><br>It is not that I think first about "hunting scapgoats" or setting any "malevolence of elites" straight. I can be comfortable with the idea that while in the past the rulling power was in the hands of kings, emperors or priests, now the real power is in the hand of some banksters and industialists.

If they set there mind to it they could completely exterminate the populations of Iraq and Afghanistan with no more troops and equipment than have been deployed previously. Precision bombing of all wells and water treatment facilities cut of the roads and all the urban populations would soon die. Bomb the mosques with MOABs clear out the villages with VX gas and pretty soon there would hardly anyone left to resist. Create desolation and call it peace.

". I take it you don't think he's going to win another term then? Sarah Palin for President! Ughh!! On the other hand if the political system is doomed anyway, and the President of the day will go down in history as the one who presided over the disaster, then although there might not be much actual policy difference between them, I would rather it was an ignorant nutcase like her who got the blame... And it would also not be good for racial harmony if the first black president ends up demonised in this way, especially in the southern states if things get nasty in the future...<br><br>Also a bit off-topic, but is the "15%" of currently energy usage referring to direct national energy use (transport, domestic, infrastructure etc), or does it also include energy used in manufacturing and importing cheap goods from faraway places, given that the energy is not actually consumed in the importing country? That will be impossible to replace with renewables. In which case the shock will be even worse, losing what is in effect a subsidy (of cheap foreign goods), having to pay the real price for things again on our already vastly reduced income.<br><br>Probably of more relevance to the spirit of your post, and also reflecting the comments of Prizm, I agree that politics is mostly useless to effect change and it's up to us to change ourselves. I've long since given up on politics. I'm in the UK and like many people saw the election of Labour in 1997 as a great "new dawn", only to be completely disillusioned - it made practically no difference as far as I can see. But possibly the kind of government it turned into was the only one the powerful vested interests would allow. And now it looks as if they will lose the next election, but not I think because of any particular policy - current prime minister lacks the personal charisma of his opponent, the people think the grass is greener etc, the vested interests don't care either way, and I find myself not caring, because I know it will probably make absolutely no difference...<br><br><a href=political-ecology-of-collapse-part.html#c9174613559541781983 title="comment permalink">12/24/09, 4:57 AM</a><br><br>

A different decision could have been made with a different person at the top, what happened was not inevitable. <br><br>So although basic economic policies seem much of a muchness, there is a difference of tone and direction, which while maybe not enough to "save industrial civilisation", can still shape the turn of events significantly?<br><br><a href=political-ecology-of-collapse-part.html#c6089507433365775870 title="comment permalink">12/24/09, 5:39 AM</a><br><br>

For example, I currently spend close to a half of my income on rent. If my income suddenly plummeted to 15% of its current self, I'd be homeless. If everyone's income plummeted by a comparable amount, the landlords would be forced to reduce rent because otherwise they wouldn't be able to find any renters. All sorts of services (from haircuts to legal services to tutoring) would also become much cheaper, because otherwise, their providers would quickly find themselves without any customers. <br><br>Ultimately, the issue is that money and energy are not the same (as you will gladly concede, I'm sure). Most of us will have to learn to do without all sorts of energy-expensive luxuries (such as foreign vacations - or vacations, period -, high-tech medical interventions, reliable power grid, adequate heating, etc. etc.), but some things that presently eat up a huge chunk of people's income (such as a roof over one's head) will not suddenly become unaffordable as we become poorer. <br><br>But overall, thanks for another informative post.<br><br><a href=political-ecology-of-collapse-part.html#c2647681686226557699 title="comment permalink">12/24/09, 6:23 AM</a><br><br>

Is power being concentrated or dispersed? Certainly wealth (a proxy for power in our society) is being concentrated in a smaller portion of the population – even more so than during the Gilded Age. Control of media outlets is likewise more concentrated.<br><br>What I see is that power is concentrated in a smaller part of the population, but that these people are not all of one mind all the time. Politicians and parties compete for the favors of these power groups, navigating the shifting allegiances and trying to build coalitions among them, while the populace is disenfranchised. So yes, there are indeed groups of elite, and one thing that they have in common is a desire to protect their position and keep the masses out of the process.<br><br>The end effect is as you describe, where nothing can be done due to the competing and amorphous power structures, but with the disenfranchisement of the majority of the population added in. That cannot be stable, as the anger (combined with ignorance) of the masses represents a large potential power base, and someone will attempt to capitalize on that one day.<br><br><a href=political-ecology-of-collapse-part.html#c8719234023906353557 title="comment permalink">12/24/09, 6:49 AM</a><br><br>

At this point I don't see any hope of getting the US political system to do anything constructive about the crisis of industrial civilization, though some other countries may be more fortunate. Here, to quote Ernest Thompson Seton, it's a matter of "do what you can, with what you have, right now."<br><br>Ken, it's not just a few thousand people who have enriched themselves in the recent trough-filling; most of the political class has gotten into the action one way or another.

Her resignation as Alaska governor followed promptly on the surfacing of solid evidence that she'd accepted bribes. As for Obama, I don't know for certain that he will be a one-term wonder, but it's certainly looking that way right now -- the GOP would have to field a complete flake against him to lose.

Nor have things changed noticeably in America in our lifetimes, beyond the fact that the financial industry has become more adept at manufacturing paper wealth -- as I pointed out to an earlier commenter, factor out the amount of "wealth transfer" that consists of the creation of fake wealth by way of derivatives and the like, and most if not all of the apparent concentration of wealth goes away.

The Chinese had their own agenda to push, as did everyone else, and of course it's relevant that if Obama had come back with anything like a realistic agreement, Congress would have torpedoed it.

I've had the same experience with people outside the US failing to grasp just how drastic our problems are; in a recent speaking gig in Canada, I mentioned the possibility of civil war in the US in the next decade or two, and the audience looked at me as though I'd sprouted a second head.

It popped like a bubble when the US government eliminated the draft. A huge amount of middle class money and administrative skill went into the antiwar movement, and a fair amount of it spread elsewhere -- but once middle class families didn't have to worry about their sons going to Vietnam, all that dried up and blew away. <br><br>Gary, I'd be absolutely stunned if a single copy got past the staffers who screen this sort of thing.

I fear we have avoided solving many problems because we were fat and rich, and as long as the economy was expanding we had some hope of things getting better.<br><br><a href=political-ecology-of-collapse-part.html#c6563633085753728857 title="comment permalink">12/24/09, 1:18 PM</a><br><br>

It was a thin pitched wail. Allahu akbar, God is great. I looked at my watch. This was no fixed time for prayers. It was 9 o'clock. The curfew had just begun. Allahu Akbar. Now the chant came from the next roof, scarcely 20 metres from my room, more a yodel than an appeal to the Almighty. I opened the door to the balcony. The cry was being carried on the air. A dozen, a hundred Allahu akbars, uncoordinated, overlaying each other, building upon a foundation of identical words, high-pitched and tenor, treble and child-like, an army of voices shouting from the rooftops of Kandahar. They swelled in volume, a thousand now, ten thousand, a choir that filled the heavens that floated beneath the white moon and the stars, the music of the spheres.”<br><br>Good journalism is hard to find these days.

We've placed our politicians in an impossible situation by demanding from them any number of impossible things -- a prosperous industrial economy and a healthy environment at the same time, for example -- and then, like the author of that article, throw a tantrum at them when they don't deliver. if we're not willing to make changes in our own lives, it's a waste of time demanding that the system make them for us, just as it's a waste of time to expect politicians to meet a moral standard that most Americans are unwilling to meet in their own lives. <br><br>And yes, an authoritarian "solution" is one very likely place that we could end up.

Most of the liberalism of the last century and a half has been built on the idea that an expanding economy can afford to spread benefits ever more widely. This is one of the reasons that liberalism has been on the wane in the US since we hit our Hubbert peak in 1970; once the economy is no longer growing, it's easy for the right to tap into the growing (and not always inaccurate) sense that any benefit given to a disadvantaged group has to be paid for by taking something away from somebody else.<br><br><a href=political-ecology-of-collapse-part.html#c1825746453755057823 title="comment permalink">12/24/09, 2:28 PM</a><br><br>

You've made sense of a bunch of diffuse impressions I collected over a long time and weaved them into something coherent.<br><br>People think I am an alien when I tell them that in North America, the ecosystems are exploited not only by the rich and powerful but by everybody. I might be biased because I live in Canada, where our social safety net is generous. The rich folks get scapegoated because they are the most successful at the game. But I don’t see how politicians or bankers can affect any real changes without being hanged on the public place: nobody want to give up anything. When I worked for the government, I had the opportunity to provide scientific inputs on policies on the management of natural resources. It does not matter that a recommendation made sense for the environment or for long term sustainability. If on the short term, if it cut on somebody comfort, convenience or pocket, unless they represent an insignificant demographic group, it goes to the garbage bin. So we cover deep gashes with band aids instead of implementing the profound structural changes needed. As example, for years scientists at the department of fisheries warned that the Northern cod fishery was unsustainable. Until the cod population collapsed, no politician could take action without signing his political death. And still, years after, the fishermen were fighting for the right to go after the last one. <br><br>The middle class is the loudest at any decrease of their spending power. Don’t ask them to give up any of their gadgets and pay 5 to 10% more for their food, even if this means that this would allow a better land stewardship, support smaller farms and give decent salary to the farm labor. In NA, we've got the cheapest grocery basket in the world and the medias pontificate that we cant eat healthy because its too expensive. Yet, it’s in the grasp of most everybody to have a healthy diet, if they prioritize expenses, buy unprocessed ingredients and cook from scratch. Cheap food is killing the land and killing the small farmers who can’t get the economy of scale of the industrial farms. There is now mounting evidences that small scale, intensive organic agriculture is more efficient in term of energy while maintaining yield and I hear people all the time complaining about industrial agriculture. Still, nothing happens except in third word countries like Cuba and pockets in NA where there is a more affluent and educated population. Why? For a first, there is less than 1% of the population which is still involved in farming; demographically they have no weight to change the fundamentals of the system. Second, most family farms are in debt to the roof and can’t invest in environmental mitigation and good land stewardship: its labor intensive and/or costly. <br><br> Everybody feel entitled to all they can get, independently of the toll on the planet and of our personal contribution to real wealth, which comes from natural resources, the sun and meaningful human labor and skills. There is no hope as long as we rationalize our unethical, self-centered choices and look for somebody else backyard to shovel responsibilities. Are we all waiting to be destitute to do what needs to be done? Even if all we can hope for are lifeboats, we still need somebody to build them. Once in the water, it’s too late. IMO, if things remain the same, the few communities which are preparing for post oil peak will be overwhelmed by the flood of clueless, unskilled, unfit hordes of people who still enjoy the Oilfest. It takes years to acquire the skills and the level of fitness to live sustainably of the land. This is not the great depression era where 8 out of 10 people were farming. Farmer John can’t cope with ninety nine strangers knocking at his door willing to work for food and lodging. Anyway, who among them could put at 10 hours a day of hard labor? My educated guess is that it will be hell if the food system can’t be turned around soon enough to reverse its brittleness, and population does not crash suddenly.<br><br><a href=political-ecology-of-collapse-part.html#c2938936425403040581 title="comment permalink">12/25/09, 4:44 AM</a><br><br>

Looking at the map(1) it is interesting to note where both Iraq and Afghanistan fall relative to that potential usurper: control/chaos in Iraq blocks land (pipeline access) to Saudi oil/gas, and Chaos/control in Afghanistan blocks land access to both Iranian and by default Saudi oil/gas. The other routes are all to a certain degree more problematical. Indeed in any future conflagration it would be relatively simple to shut off supplies very rapidly if one has a substantial influence in that area.<br>And from a purely systemic perspective (a la Gall) the privatised war machine/system itself will grow and grow until all resources are directed to solely maintaining its existence, even its purpose which has been usurped to this new end. And it started a while back too – George Orwell’s ‘1984’ is a play on numbers – rumour has it he originally intended to call it 1948! Of course certain systemic types will profit from its various teats, but the system itself will roll on to what eventual ends one can only surmise.

So yes, it's like shooting fish in a barrel. <br><br>Thardiust, true enough!<br><br>Ron, it's easy to play the "prove it" game in a forum like this, and come up with analyses to back any viewpoint you care to imagine. Since my background is in history and philosophy rather than, say, engineering, I get my technical data from people who do have the technical background and whose claims seem reasonable to me, most of whom post on the Oil Drum. I'm familiar with claims of the sort you've made, and I find them less convincing than the ones that have guided my work here; but if you think otherwise, then I'd encourage you to get to work and prove me wrong -- preferably by actually helping to develop and deploy a renewable energy technology. <br><br>Chad, I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but you need to talk to a therapist. <br><br>Kevin, thanks for a reasoned response! I don't disagree for a moment that there are people who have a disproportionate amount of power in modern America, just as there are in every human society; I note, though, that the country is sinking ever deeper into political gridlock, which is not what normally happens when power is concentrated in the hands of an unchecked elite. <br><br>Thanks also for raising the point that the vast majority of people in America and elsewhere have no clue about fossil fuel depletion, or any of the other hard implications of the limits to growth. One of the troubling trends in modern society is that people increasingly talk only to those who already share their viewpoints. One result is a huge number of assumptions about what "the people" think that have nothing to do with what ordinary Americans believe about the world. <br><br>Tristan, I am now! Thanks for that -- it's the best summary of our predicament I've seen in a long while. <br><br>Pangolin, I'm not sure where we are in the list of dominoes, but the sort of dysfunctions you've listed are pervasive enough that I suspect something's going to give tolerably soon. <br><br>Marielar, thank you! One of the things that makes me roll my eyes when middle class pseudoradicals insist that there's some sinister cabal on top of the world is that the North American middle class is arguably the most pampered group of human beings in the history of the world, provided with privileges and pleasures medieval emperors couldn't get, and blithely unaware that those privileges and pleasures are theirs largely because the rest of humanity is being denied three square meals a day and a decent roof over their heads. You're quite right; very few people in the middle class, or most other classes for that matter, are interested in saving the world if that means accepting a lowered standard of living. The fact that this means their standard of living is going to go down the toilet in the not too distant future just adds to the irony.<br><br><a href=political-ecology-of-collapse-part.html#c2836406101968390843 title="comment permalink">12/25/09, 12:07 PM</a><br><br>

So I'll begin with a quote from Marcel Proust: "Facts do not enter into the place where our beliefs dwell." (from Du côté de chez Swann; original text: "Les faits ne pénètrent pas dans le monde où vivent nos croyances.") I very much doubt that Proust was thinking of limits to growth and overshoot when he wrote that but wisdom is expandable.<br><br>That was to signal agreement with the Archdruid as to the mighty disconnect between what many people may think will bail us out and what nature has in 'mind' for us. J. Bray, commenting here, came pretty close when he wrote: " ...people will hang onto the idea they've committed themselves to previously." Who cares about the 2nd law of thermodynamics and resource depletion on a finite planet?<br><br>An aside on the question of conspiracies, New World Order, etc. which seems to come up recurrently on this blog comment page among others: Conspiracies have always existed, still do and will continue to, well beyond the lifetime of anyone reading this (see the history of the Italian Medici family for a good primer from the Renaissance). Governments do not exist without conspiracies, period! (Oh, sorry, that was an exclamation point). They may be "rudderless," as Alan Moore suggests, they do not cease to exist for all that. 'They' in fact spend great quantities of money (40% of the Defense budget in this country is 'black,' i.e. unaccounted for, according to Chalmers Johnson; that is BIG money). 'They'do indeed have considerable wealth and power, more than anyone has ever had in the history of the world in fact but 'they' do not always agree amongst themselves regarding what should be done with it. As the Archdruid points out, power-and-money-hungry factions abound. And 'They,' rather than building a NWO, seem to be stuck into a paradigm which guarantees the emergence of a NWD (New World Disorder) ... the 'best' laid plans of mice and men? 'They' should nevertheless not be underestimated as a force to be reckoned with and which may yet be capable of pulling off a coup or two to the detriment of 'lesser citizens.' To pretend they control everything and are responsible for all the world's problems is idiocy. To pretend they don't exist is a cop-out. <br><br>More importantly though, the key issues (food, water, energy) must become more regional and locally grounded starting NOW, despite all efforts on 'their' part. When people finally realize who they (not 'They') are, they will understand how well-founded was Montaigne's admonition: "Of all our maladies, the most injurious is the scorn we show for our own being."<br><br>PS Well, not sure what this is worth but, frankly, when was the last time you saw Proust and Montaigne quoted on the same page?<br><br><a href=political-ecology-of-collapse-part.html#c1354765945694950904 title="comment permalink">12/26/09, 4:18 PM</a><br><br>

I also like the quote from Upton Sinclair: "It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his job depends on not understanding it."<br><br>Tyler, from my perspective you're putting things in inappropriately all-or-nothing terms. Energy shortages are already a fact of life in much of the Third World, and the additional burden of rising real costs for energy production (however covered up by government subsidies, etc.) are having a real and damaging impact on economies worldwide. That will likely get much worse in the years and decades to come. We don't have to run out of energy entirely for shortages and rising costs to shred the fabric of life in the industrial world. <br><br>Gav, of course conspiracies exist; not too long ago I filled <a href=http://www.harpercollins.com.au/books/9780007298952/The_Element_Encyclopedia_Of_Secret_Societies_The_Ultimate_AZ_of/index.aspx rel=nofollow>a 250,000-word encyclopedia</a> with info about them. Lots of conspiracies exist, and rather more often than not, they're at war with one another. The thing that most people don't get, though, is that political conspiracy is a tool of weakness, not of strength. Every successful political conspiracy, from the Sons of Liberty to the Thule-Gesellschaft, dropped the secret handshakes and the conspiratorial methods the moment it was strong enough to turn into an overt political movement. If the American political class were as riddled with conspiracies as some people think, that would be solid evidence of the essential weakness of that class.<br><br><a href=political-ecology-of-collapse-part.html#c4234246447729996413 title="comment permalink">12/26/09, 8:05 PM</a><br><br>

Government: liberals (and communists) put much emphasis on<br>government and world government. Anarchists remind us that govt might<br>not be a good thing. Of course the idea is taken to the extreme that ANY govt is bad. But taken in moderate doses, it is an healthy antidote to the liberal fetish of a vanguard government that will steer us to paradise. I note, BTW, that (some) conservatives are also<br>fans of big govt, just in different way: think WTO (as a form of world<br>order) or the military.<br><br>2. Self-reliance. Again the anarchist extreme should be avoided: direct action is not a good idea (furthermore, it is self-defeating). But, again, it provides a nice antidote to the liberal/communist view that the "oppressed" are a bunch of weak people<br>in need of piety and state assistance. Anarchists stress the idea of self-education, bottom-up approaches and community. The libertarian<br>center was in many cases, above all, a library. Anyway, in some sense there are some connections between traditional anarchism and conservativism as both invite people to try to take responsibility for their own destiny.<br><br>3. Localism and autonomous communities. I find the idea of "one Earth,<br>one people therefore one single solution", particularly dangerous. While the idea that we are all in this together in the same big ecosystem is a good one, and also the idea that we all share the same basic human rights is cool, the extrapolation that therefore a<br>single solution fits all and that there is a vanguard that is in the<br>possession of that solution strikes me as particularly dangerous.<br><br>Much of the inspiration for the comments above comes, not only from<br>reading anarchist authors, but also from reading something more<br>fashionable nowadays: Taleb's Black Swan. And also Herman Daly.<br><br>A good measure of decoupling (autonomy, if you prefer) is a good thing, IMHO.<br><br>From a philosophical perspective anarchism provides a good antidote to<br>some dangerous underlying assumptions of the left.

The 15% limit on renewable use is a limit referring to using solar energy when the sun is shining and using wind energy when the wind is blowing... In those situation then clearly you need substantial alternative energy production from other means when the wind is not blowing and when the sun is not shining and when you have only a very limited capacity to move energy around the country... But currently we have these alternatives: gas, nuclear, coal. In the future when these deplete (and I don't see breeder nuclear reactors depleting) we will have storage devices to use solar and wind energy at any time. And the amount of potential wind and solar, and other renewable energy is vastly greater than what we will want to use. So I simply do not see any long-term energy crisis. What we have is a short-term energy crisis, but this short-term period (say the next 30 years or so) is probably longer than the rest of my life. And the fact that the world is making virtually no effort to transition means that the transition will be very brutal.<br><br><a href=political-ecology-of-collapse-part.html#c1256108696034390951 title="comment permalink">12/27/09, 6:44 AM</a><br><br>

Back when there was such a thing as conservatism -- we don't have that in America any more, you just two quarreling sets of Utopian true believers with different prescriptions for the perfect society -- each of the points you've raised were also things that conservatives supported and upheld.

So, I guess that his numbers are not so far off ... obviously suposing that nothing really changes: if you don't eat bananas from Martinique, you don't spend the energy needed to transport it to your home in edible conditions and that skewes direct comparisons. <br><br>I guess that most people failed to see the relevance of the comparison of today's USA with the end of the Roman republic ( that , probably not by acident, already had passed my mind several times during the last decade ). Probably the biggest diference is the lack of personal armies in the sense that Julius Caesar, Sulla, Marius, Pompey or Octavius had ( but there is little diference between Blackwater and co and the private armies that Pompey or Octavius had assembled and put at the service of Republic as long as it was useful for them )... atleast for now, that is. A thing that is a bad omen: the late Roman republic in it's agony spreaded chaos everywhere their armies could get ( my biggest concern with the US Army is exactly that: that politics get berserk and use it to try to get stuff worldwide at gunpoint while they still have bullets at a scale that makes the current operations in the Middle East child's play ) while Italy proper was dilacerated by raging poverty due to the destruction of the communities by the big owners "enclousures" and focus on meat production ( ovines, as Australians start to understand now, are only second to the caprines in terms of destroying soils due to erosion and there is wide documentation of areas in Italy like Apulia, that had been a a wheat haven, becoming a barren wasteland due to the uncontroled proliferation of big owners ovine cattle ) ... if America goes that way, it will be very bad to everyone.<br><br>To make things worse, my biggest fear seems that is coming true: that someone reads history as I did , but takes the conclusion that Augustus saved the day by unification of control. Augustus saved the Roman empire of collapsing in his days not because of unifying control in a sense that everyone would call fascist or worse today ( well, Mussolini admired Augustus ... ) but by ( mostly unwillingly ) reducing the spendings, especially on military. Rome in the later years of Augustus had a smaller military that the forces that Julius and Pompey had in hands in Pharsalia alone, just to give a idea of how bloated the military had become in those days. A similar evolution in America would need, as it happened in Rome, some decades of bitter civil wars in and out of the country to soften enough the people to acept a <i>princeps</i> in Octavian terms ( that is, a messianic figure, a <i>soter</i>, a <i>divus</i> ) . And ,besides that, Rome power was not based in the use of a rapidly decreasing resource as the US is ( if I had to guess I would say that , without oil , the US military power is 0 or very close of it: tanks, mechanized infantry and planes run basically on oil and the whole philosophy behind the US army is to have secure and ample logistical support ... Rome army only needed iron ore, wood , food and cannon fodder ) , so any direct comparison is hard.<br><br>Anyway, Happy <i>Natalis Solis Invictus</i><br><br><a href=political-ecology-of-collapse-part.html#c8470988644760895851 title="comment permalink">12/27/09, 11:40 AM</a><br><br>

Or even Canada, with 7 ha per capita EF. <br><br>It may surprised quite a few, but Marx had great ecological insights and was very well versed in the science of his time and Darwin's and Justus von Liebig's work influenced him . <br>He certainly was very insighful on the impact of capitalism on soil degradation:<br><br>"Moreover, all progress in capitalistic agriculture is a progress in the art, not only of robbing the labourer, but of robbing the soil; all progress in increasing the fertility of the soil for a given time, is a progress towards ruining the lasting sources of that fertility. The more a country starts its development on the foundation of modern industry, like the United States, for example, the more rapid is this process of destruction. Capitalist production, therefore, develops technology, and the combining together of various processes into a social whole, only by sapping the original sources of all wealth — the soil and the labourer."<br> Anyhow, here an interesting essay on the topic.<br>http://www.monthlyreview.org/091101foster-clark.php<br><br><a href=political-ecology-of-collapse-part.html#c4912530858553603725 title="comment permalink">12/27/09, 12:18 PM</a><br><br>

You're square on target, though, when you note the vulnerability of the US military to energy shortages. Our entire military doctrine basically consists of winning by burning more fossil fuels than the other guy, and unless we retool in a hurry, the US military and those of its allies and satellite states may find themselves hugely vulnerable to armies that use less fuel and more manpower. <br><br>John, well, yes.

There's a saying in Russia these days: "Every word Marx wrote about Communism was false, but every word he wrote about capitalism is true." <br><br>Thomas, heck of a good question. The problem with any kind of easy answer is that historical events are driven by extraordinarily complex and unpredictable patterns of cause and effect in which accident and statistical noise play huge roles; it's almost never possible to say "this action will produce this effect" and be right even a majority of the time. <br><br>One of the few consistent patterns I note, though, is that it's when people are convinced that change can only make things better that it's most likely that change will make things worse; those who expect heaven on earth are most likely to encounter the opposite. The problem, of course, is how to get people thinking about just how ghastly things could get if we don't start paying attention to the downside, and I don't have an easy answer for that, either.<br><br><a href=political-ecology-of-collapse-part.html#c8120297345036374718 title="comment permalink">12/28/09, 7:52 AM</a><br><br>

Often we're presented with official explanations of things that require one to believe an unlikely series of coincidences and logical leaps, and accept various obvious errors. The rational response is to greet this stuff with a healthy skepticism. The information vacuum naturally attracts those who believe in space lizards to jump in with their own ideas, but those who would merely say "this explanation is obvious crap" get tarred with the same "conspiracy theory" brush even if they propose no theory at all. I find it especially irritating when the term is applied to those who are explicitly rejecting an obviously flawed theory about a conspiracy. <br><br>The phrase has become a pejorative expression often used to discredit both those who espouse truly nutty ideas (like Shiner's) and those who refuse to go along with official propaganda. It now means "bad things we are not supposed think about", and it really needs to be retired. Ideas do not really need names or labels.<br><br>I can assure you that many of the ideas presented here will be greeted with howls of conspiracy theory by the public at large. Many of the things I have come to understand over the years would be too, and a few even actually are literally that - but so what. My mind is open to ideas, and I am not afraid to consider things even if others are laughing at them.

It helps to assuage my fears of the feds instituting Mussolini-type fascism. I look forward to a partitioning of the former-USA into regional factions. <br><br>Your latest writing seems to indicate you are shortening the timeline of the "long descent" into a more precipitous decline. I am looking for a Black Tuesday in February myself, but if it doesn't happen, I will continue in my present fashion.<br><br>One other point. There is quite a difference between elders in hunter-gatherer tribes or even clan-based agricultural societies and the ruling elites of state-level societies. Structurally, it is the difference between resources shared by families and resources shared by class. Culturally, it is the reinforcement of traditions in two separate foci - family vs. the state. Mussolini and other dictators were quite astute to act as "fathers" to their people in order to confuse the two. In Italy today you can still hear some affection for Mussolini - "at least he made the trains run on time." Neither Obama, nor Palin, nor whoever becomes the next President can get that done (as one example), so it would be very hard to see them as a valid father/mother figure.<br><br>Finally, per the paranoiacs out there, I like this old saying.

It's based on a recognition that the hunt for culprits very often turns into a search for scapegoats to blame for our collective mistakes and a distraction from the hard work we need to pursue right now. Those who blame a cabal around Dubya for conspiring to invade Iraq, for example, are evading the fact that everybody who bought an SUV was in effect voting for that invasion with their pocketbooks. <br><br>Walter, the collapse of the current US political system (and its replacement by another) does not equal the end of industrial society. My timeline is the same as it's been; I'm simply pointing to one of the potentially imminent crises that will play a role in the long descent.

From this perspective, your model of many competing players wielding political influence could be roughly quantified... about 20% of those players wield 80% of the power... if, within that 20%, about 20% of them wield 80% of the 80%, and this process repeats a few times in a nested fashion, then you would get something approximating the 'evil elite' that some of the conspiracy-minded posters have postulated.<br><br>Abstract wealth DOES work this way, with a few gazillionaires owning more 'money' than the rest of us put together, but as you have pointed out, this wealth is largely chimerical.<br><br>Politics is considerably more complex. Since pork-barreling involves control of real infrastructure and resources, and meeting obligations up and down the political food chain, I suspect that negative feedbacks prevent the 'Nested Pareto Principle' from applying for more than a couple of iterations. That would be just enough consolidation of power to make belief in conspiracies plausible, but not enough to make belief in them predictive of the behavior of the system as a whole, which strikes me as roughly the way things actually work out.<br><br>It is also worth noting that there is a fine line between a conspiracy and the existence of covert players in the system. Black operations exist, and at a large enough scale that millions of Americans have been exposed to them at various points in their lives. <br><br>As a trivial example -- I grew up partially in Southeast Asia, living for a time on a massive covert airbase run by a CIA proprietary airline that existed to support a secret war in a technically neutral country. This experience was not unusual. Literally millions of Americans have spent time living and working in the illegal 'black' world, and many have come out of this experience with a predisposition to believe that covert power trumps civil power. We have seen it demonstrated in at least one domain, so we know that it may also be the case in others.<br><br>It may be that this is even a small factor in the decline of US civil society... when too much of the population has witnessed the black world, civil society begins to seem unreal to them -- a kind of puppet theater rather than an actual exercise of power. From this position it is a small step to despairing of participation.<br><br>Of course the nature of the covert operation makes a huge difference in its subsequent blowback on civil society - many people worked on the Manhattan Project and went on as humane and constructive local and national leaders. I doubt that the same can generally be said of the Phoenix Program.<br><br>Looking ahead, decline and disintegration will tend to reduce the power of elites, 'conspiracies', covert ops, and the rest of the menagerie of centralized power, since all of these require a great deal of social complexity, wealth, and energy to exist.<br><br>I believe you are right in emphasizing that however differently we might view recent history and politics, constructive social and political engagement with each other in our communities is essential in the future.<br><br><a href=political-ecology-of-collapse-part.html#c2285252711459117746 title="comment permalink">12/29/09, 1:32 PM</a><br><br>

I thought that discussing its main premise might have dovetailed with your previous post on fraternal groups like the Elks , Odd Fellows, etc. It seemed to me that it might be useful to discuss mutual aid organizations from a more working class left-wing perspective. Back before social security and unemployment insurance many grassroots independent organizations were out there helping working people. Many were organized by Anarchists, and Socialists. Anarchist organizations in Spain during their civil war did some incredible things. Recently, the occupied factory movement in Argentina has also been interesting to study. Naomi Klein’s movie “The Take” covers the Argentinean movement well. As the world continues to degenerate we are likely to see a revival, and an improvement, of these older organizational models. I have been thinking this over for a few years now, and I have concluded that building neighborhood committees, workplace groups, rural groups, etc., that are independent, creative and self-organized are a way forward to address the hard times coming . I do not see voting, or placing any confidence in government as being a useful strategy. Emma Goldman said it best: “If voting changed anything they would make it illegal.” I must admit I still like the Wobblies’ idea of “One Big Union” and general strikes as means to fight for social change.<br>Marx died in the 1880’s and could not possibly have known about or been responsible for the 1917 Russian Revolution or the Stalinist states that came later on. Whether Marx would have supported Lenin and the Bolsheviks has been debated since the beginning. Many Marxists did not support what happened during that era. Marx’s original Social Democratic Parties exist to this day in Germany and other places as you are probably aware. I found it surprising that you felt like you could dispatch with Marxism in only a couple of pages in The Long Descent. It’s just another religion according to you, end of story. In your reply to me you barely give it couple of sentences. I think Marxism is far more complex than your treatment of it.<br>I think that Marx’s Das Kapital was a brilliant critique of capitalism and worth reviewing. Historical Materialism is also worth some thought. As you can probably guess I come from a Marxist background, but I wouldn’t really call myself a Marxist anymore. It doesn’t look much like the industrial proletariat will be making a revolution any time soon. In fact it could well disappear as an economic class as the deindustrialization process progresses But Marxism as a methodology still has its relevance. <br>Its you’re blog you can obviously discuss what you please.
