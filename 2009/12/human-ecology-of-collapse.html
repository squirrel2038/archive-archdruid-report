<span style=font-size:130%>Part One: Failure is the Only Option</span><br><br>The old legend of the Holy Grail has a plot twist that’s oddly relevant to the predicament of industrial civilization. A knight who went searching for the Grail, so the story has it, if he was brave and pure, would sooner or later reach an isolated castle in the midst of the desolate Waste Land. There the Grail could be found and the Waste Land made green again, but only if the knight asked the right question. Failing that, he would wake the next morning in a deserted castle, which would vanish behind him as soon as he left, and it might take years of searching to find the castle again.<br><br>As we approach the twilight of the age of cheap energy, we’re arguably in a similar situation. It seems to me that a great deal of the confusion that grips the peak oil scene, and even more of the blind commitment to catastrophically misguided policies that reigns outside peak-aware circles, comes from a failure to ask the right questions. A great many people aware of the limits to fossil fuels, for example, have assumed that the question that needs answering is how to sustain a modern industrial society on alternative energy.<br><br>Ask that, though, and you’re back in the Waste Land, because any answer you give to that question is wrong. The question that has to be asked is whether a modern industrial society can exist at all without vast and rising inputs of essentially free energy, of the sort only available on this planet from fossil fuels, and the answer is no. Once that’s grasped, other useful questions come to mind – for example, how much of the useful legacy of the last three centuries can be saved, and how – but until you get past the wrong question, you’re stuck chasing the mirage of a replacement for oil that didn’t take a hundred million years or so to come into being.<br><br>Other examples could be cited easily enough. As the world’s political leaders busy themselves in Copenhagen for a round of photo ops and brutal backroom politics, though, the unasked question that hangs most visibly in the air is why human societies, faced with choices between survival and collapse, so consistently make the choices that destroy them.<br><br>It’s implicit in most discussions of peak oil, climate change, and nearly any other global issue you care to name, that if we all just try hard enough we can overcome the crisis du jour and chug boldly on into the future. Those in the political mainstream tend to insist, in the face of the evidence, that replacing the people currently in charge of political or economic systems with somebody else will solve the problem. Those outside the political mainstream tend to insist, also in the face of the evidence, that swapping out current political or economic systems with others more to their liking will solve the problem.<br><br>Nearly all the media coverage of the Copenhagen circus, mainstream or alternative, falls into these camps. While the mainstream right pounds its collective fist on an assortment of lecterns and insists that the polar bears would be just fine if the last round of elections had gone the other way, the mainstream left fills the air with pleas that Obama live up to the nearly messianic fantasy role they projected onto him – will somebody please explain to me someday how a head of state got given the Nobel Peace Prize while he was enthusiastically waging two wars? Meanwhile the socialists are insisting that it’s all capitalism’s fault and can be solved promptly by a socialist revolution, never mind the awkward little fact that the environmental records of socialist countries are by and large even worse than those of capitalist ones; other radicalisms of left and right make the same claim as the socialists, often with even less justification.<br><br>Still, I think a great many people are beginning to realize that whatever results come out of Copenhagen, a meaningful response to the increasing instability of global climate will not be among them. James Hansen, among the most prestigious of global warming scientists, has announced to the media that he hopes the Copenhagen talks fail, because none of the options being taken to the talks would have any useful result; we’d be better off, he argues, to start over again from scratch. He’s right about the first point, it seems to me, and wrong about the second, because if we start again from scratch, care to guess where we’ll end up? Right back where we are now, face to face with the yawning gap between those things that are politically possible and those things that would actually deal with the crisis at hand.<br><br>Those people who are not in positions of power, and thus don’t have to face the consequences of political decisions, commonly insist that politicians can or should simply leap across chasms of this sort to deliver the goods to their constituents. Copenhagen offers a useful lesson on why such rhetoric is wasted breath. Suppose, for the sake of discussion, that Obama agreed to cut US carbon emissions far enough to make a real impact on global climate change. Would those cuts happen? No, because Congress would have to agree to implement them, and Congress – even though it is controlled by a Democratic majority – has so far been unable to pass even the most ineffectual legislation on the subject.<br><br>Suppose the improbable happened, and both Obama and Congress agreed to implement serious carbon emission cuts. What would the result be? Much more likely than not, a decisive Republican victory in the 2010 congressional elections, followed by the repeal of the laws mandating the cuts. Carbon emissions can’t be cut by waving a magic wand; the cuts will cost trillions of dollars at a time when budgets are already strained, and impose steep additional costs throughout the economy. Those latter would be unpopular even if the consensus on climate change were accepted on faith outside the scientific community, which it isn’t. Even those Congresspersons who would most like to see carbon emissions cuts made into law do think about their prospects of remaining in office now and again.<br><br>Even between nations, a rough and ready version of the same pattern of checks and balances applies; any nation that accepts serious carbon emission cuts will place itself at a steep economic disadvantage compared to those nations that don’t. Watch the way the competing power blocs at Copenhagen are trying to shove responsibility for emissions cuts onto one another, and you can see this at work. Remember the failed trade negotiations of the last decade, in which Europe and the US tried to browbeat the rising industrial powers of the Third World into accepting a permanent second-class position? They’re at it again, using carbon emission allotments in place of trade treaties, and the Third World is once again having none of it.<br><br>Notice that what’s happening in all these cases is that the system is working the way it’s supposed to work. Elected representatives, after all, are supposed to worry about what their constituents back home will think; the excesses of each party are supposed to be held in check by the well-founded worry that the other party can and will make political hay out of any missteps the party in power might happen to make. For that matter, national governments justify their existence by defending the interests of their citizens in international disputes. In most cases, these checks and balances are not only useful but vitally important; unchecked power in any aspect of human life pretty consistently turns into tyranny. In certain cases, though, these otherwise helpful protections turn into barriers that keep necessary decisions from being made.<br><br>The belief that none of this matters, and that somebody or other could fix the problem if they wanted to, runs deep. This is why so much of the rhetoric on both sides of the climate debate focuses so obsessively on finding somebody to blame. Of course there has been reprehensible behavior on both sides. Business executives whose companies will bear a large share of the costs of curbing carbon emissions have funded some very dubious science, and some even more dubious publicity campaigns, in order to duck those costs; academics have either tailored their findings to climb onto the climate change bandwagon, or whored themselves out to corporate interests willing to pay handsomely for anyone in a lab coat who will repeat their party line; politicians on both sides of the aisle have distorted facts grotesquely to further their own careers.<br><br>All this has been fodder for endless denunciation. Beneath all the yelling, though, are a set of brutal facts nobody is willing to address. Whether or not the current round of climate instability is entirely the product of anthropogenic CO2 emissions is actually not that important, because it’s even more stupid to dump greenhouse gases into a naturally unstable climate system than it would be to dump them into a stable one. Over the long run, the only level of carbon pollution that is actually sustainable is zero net emissions, and getting there any time soon would require something not far from the dismantling of industrial society and its replacement with something much less affluent. Now of course we would have to do this anyway, since the world’s fossil fuel supplies are depleting fast enough that production limits will begin to bite hard in the years and decades ahead, but this simply sharpens the point at issue.<br><br>Even if it turns out to be possible to power something like an industrial society on renewable resources, the huge energy, labor, and materials costs needed to develop renewable energy and replace most of the infrastructure of today’s society with new systems geared to new energy sources will have to be paid out of existing supplies; thus everything else would have to be cut to the bone, or beyond. Exactly how big the price tag would be is anybody’s guess just now, but it’s probably not far from the mark to suggest that the population of the industrial world would have to accept a Third World standard of living, and the population of the Third World would have to give up aspirations for a better life for the foreseeable future, for such a gargantuan project to have any chance of working.<br><br>I encourage those who think this latter is a politically viable option to try to convince their spouses and friends to take such steps voluntarily. Any politician rash enough to propose such a project would be well advised to kiss his or her next election goodbye. Any president who even took a step in that direction – well, I doubt many people have forgotten what happened to Jimmy Carter. For that matter, I’m sure there must be climate change zealots who have given up their McMansions, sold their cars, and now live in one-room apartments in rat-infested tenements with six other activists so all their spare money can go to building a renewable economy, but I don’t happen to know any who have done so, while I long ago lost track of the number of global warming bumper stickers I’ve seen on the rear ends of SUVs.<br><br>Nobody, but nobody, is willing to deal with the harsh reality of what a carbon-neutral society would have to be like. This is what makes the blame game so popular, and it also provides the impetus behind meaningless gestures of the sort that are on the table at Copenhagen. It’s a common piece of rhetoric these days to say that “failure is not an option,” but this sort of feckless thoughtstopper misses the point as totally as any human utterance possibly could. Failure is always an option; when trying to prevent it will lead to highly unpleasant personal consequences, without actually having the least chance of preventing it, a strong case can be made that the most viable option for anyone in a leadership position is to enjoy the party while it lasts, and hope you can duck the blame when it all comes crashing down.<br><br>Those who have their doubts about anthropogenic climate change can apply the identical logic to the industrial world’s sustained nonresponse to the peaking of world oil production, or to any of half a dozen other global crises that result from the collision between an economy geared to infinite growth and the relentless limits of a finite planet. In each case, the immediate costs of doing something about the issue are so high, and so unendurable, that very few people in positions of influence are willing to stick their necks out, and those who do so can count on being shortened by a head by others who are more than willing to cash in on their folly.<br><br>There’s another way to understand the paradox that makes failure the only viable option, but it will involve a glance backwards over the history of the sustainability movement and the theoretical structure – systems theory – that once undergirded it. That glance, and its implications, will occupy the second part of this series.

I believe you.

Nevertheless, I must quibble with the following statement: "academics have either tailored their findings to climb onto the climate change bandwagon, or whored themselves out to corporate interests willing to pay handsomely for anyone in a lab coat who will repeat their party line". I think that statement needs to be qualified substantially to reflect reality; i.e., only a small minority of academics tailored their findings.<br><br>In fact, most academics have spent many years and significant effort attempting to understand an immensely complex system, and have mostly come to the same alarming conclusion, with little or no political pressure to do so. Few academic subjects have been so thoroughly vetted as climate change, and the degree of consensus and scientific support for the evidence is overwhelming. As a result, I think you give a bit too much credit to the opposition by assuming some sort of equivalence between the errors of the anti-climate change lobby and those made recently by a few climate change scientists. <br><br>Of course, as you have correctly pointed out, whether or not the scientific evidence will have any impact on public policy is another matter; but when the seas rise and everything goes to hell, the scientists will have every right to say "we were right and we tried to warn you."<br><br><a href=human-ecology-of-collapse.html#c4784129578513423489 title="comment permalink">12/9/09, 5:36 PM</a><br><br>

Their head-in-the-sand attitude makes sure that peak oil isn't high on anyones agenda. <br><br>Two examples of this: in the teeth of the greatest worldwide recession in recent memory, oil has only come down to the 70-80 dollar a barrel level - a price that was considered nosebleed high just a few years ago.

Despite what we continue to hear from proponents of AGW, the debate is not over. In the field of science -- and especially those branches of it that attempt to understand or forecast the behavior of complex systems -- the debate is <i>never</i> over; all conclusions are provisional.<br><br>I refer to AGW as a hypothesis because recent disclosures ("Climategate") have cast such doubt on the quality of AGW science that its conclusions should thrown out, especially considering the global "governance" that the Copenhagen conference is about to usher in, should it succeed. This ain't just me talking; there are more skeptical scientists and meteorologists than there are true believers. Among the most vocal and articulate skeptics are Lord Christopher Monckton. I encourage everyone to read and listen to him with an open mind (you all know how to google by now). <br><br>My own layman's research leads me to the conclusion that CO2 follows, not causes, climate change; that it is a tiny fraction of our atmosphere; that it benefits all plant life; and that anthropogenic CO2 levels are insignificant to Gaia. This is not to say that I believe man is impotent to affect our climate; a few hundred ICBMs launched in a moment of panic would probably forestall any chance of global warning.<br><br>Nevertheless, I hope that fossil-fuel emissions will dwindle -- because of the many other, <i>real</i> atmospheric pollutants that pour out of automobile tailpipes and industrial smokestacks all over the world, 24x7.<br><br><a href=human-ecology-of-collapse.html#c2239009720465341990 title="comment permalink">12/9/09, 6:34 PM</a><br><br>

As for your projects, excellent -- this is exactly the sort of thing that makes me less gloomy about the far future. <br><br>Duncan, I've already explained what individuals can do in a couple of dozen posts and two books, so I'll refer you to those. <br><br>Rick, in my experience it's a good deal more than a few recent errors. I've heard from scientists in a number of fields -- most of whom are in agreement that there's some level of anthropogenic climate change -- who've talked about the way that climate change has become the latest fashion in a range of environmental sciences, to the detriment of good research.

You can just about guarantee that any media article about energy will get everything that matters dead wrong. <br><br>Eric, thanks for the link! This is promising. You're right that it's not going to slow things down noticeably, but at least these people are living their beliefs -- and Gandhi's comment about being the change you want to see in the world is a potent strategy. <br><br>Wrad, that's an interesting hypothesis, though I find it hard to imagine that the megatons of CO2 we're dumping into the atmosphere are having no effect at all -- it's a basic rule of ecology that there's no such place as "away."

While the politicians and news media rail on about carbon, the lack of sunspots indicates a regime of global cooling. The present winter may become one of the most severe on record. Meanwhile, global temperature maps indicate that the warming is more localized than previously thought, and may have geothermal causes driven by space-based electromagnetic phenomena. Cutting carbon emissions is not likely to have much impact on either of these trends. The real cause of all the confusion is simply the current time, which has been known and anticipated for thousands of years in the Vedic literature and culture as the border between two ages: the dark interregnum of materialism following the fall of the Vedic Empire and the beginning of Kali-yuga, and the establishment of its successor in the next historical era. Of course, all this knowledge has been suppressed in the West, but as a Druid you should have some appreciation for the value of ancient wisdom. We certainly do, for it explains the background and context of the current changes and gives us many concepts and tools to deal with them.<br><br><a href=human-ecology-of-collapse.html#c17336681384903762 title="comment permalink">12/9/09, 7:22 PM</a><br><br>

Shuttering a bankrupt factory, mothballing a fleet of surplus trucks, and having your household power turned off for non-payment don't cost very much at all, at least not in terms of line items in the federal budget. It's CONTROLLED and PLANNED reductions that are expensive.<br><br>Which of course comes back to one of your grand themes, the myth of progress. We are a civilization composed of Al Haigs -- we're in charge here, dammit. We can control things, we must attack with plan and proposal and scheme and make it all WORK. Never mind the fact that the present was not planned, but just sort of happened; the FUTURE can be exactly what we chose for it. This sticks the collective mind in the rut of sustaining what we already have -- after all "sustainability" is the buzzword of the New Millenium so far -- which means sustainable versions of what we already have, so we can sustain ourselves and the world as we know it. I needn't tell you, JMG, that most people of all political stripes are so deeply steeped in this that they are almost literally blind to any other view. <br><br>There's another fellow who moved here (just 7 miles down the road) at about the same time we did, from only about 15 miles away from where we had lived in Colorado. The parallels between us seem superficially bizarre, but they don't go very deep. He is a died in the wool Peak-Oiler, but whenever I talk to him it's all about politics, technology, socioeconomic conspiracy theories, the price of gold, and the like. His head is filled with geopolitics and elaborate permaculturish schemes for raising tomatoes on trout urine, etc. (I hope he's not one of your readers, or he'll surely recognize himself...). I'm always listening to him and thinking, "Dude, if you really believe the fossil-fueled industrial system is on its last legs, as you say, then might you not be better spending your time planting a garden, learning how to manage a coppice, figuring out how you might get drinking water without electricity, and that sort of thing?"<br><br>In my immediate neighborhood, there is a de-suburbanization happening on a small scale. One fellow has bought up three residential properties and converted them into a small (real) free-range poultry operation, another now has chickens, hogs, and a horse on acreage where the previous owners kept only a herd of riding lawn mowers, and we are repairing, restoring, and weatherizing our 19th century house rather than razing it and slapping together something from prefab materials bought at the Home Despot. None of this is happening as part of any grand plan, these neighbors are hillbillies, rednecks, and country folk to the core. They are responding to the changes they feel in the world and deciding how they want to shift their lives in their community. Meanwhile the "official" green community is busy writing grant proposals. <br><br>Ooo ooo do we get to pull out our energy circuit diagrams for the next installment???<br><br>P.S. for Duncan -- Fishing might in fact be an excellent idea<br><br><a href=human-ecology-of-collapse.html#c8421143224981505471 title="comment permalink">12/9/09, 10:09 PM</a><br><br>

Generally speaking, I'm against most attempts at geo-engineering, but this one seems to have so many possibly beneficial effects, not least of which is carbon sequestration, followed by rebuilding topsoil and the production of (small amounts) of clean, renewable energy. Oh, and it's so easy practically anybody can do it; although we'd need a real civilizational effort if we wanted to make an observable dent in the CO2 content of the atmosphere (and small-scale operations probably couldn't make use of the biofuels produced). I've heard of different flavors of biochar: farm-waste biochar and afforestation biochar. The latter is somewhat interesting: create new forest somewhere, allow it to grow, then convert it to char, permanently sequestering the carbon that was once in the wood. That char then becomes a valuable soil amendment.<br><br>I more-or-less concur with you on the subject of general economic and industrial decline, but I'm not yet willing to give up on the issue of global warming. And there's always the possibility that, along with general decline, some locales may be able to maintain (relative) prosperity.<br><br>One last thought... you make good points vis-a-vis political "reality", but that only points to the need for concerned individuals to get away from the computer, shove aside some of their apathy and distaste for their fellows, and organize locally - into what <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Alinsky rel=nofollow>Saul Alinksy</a> called "mass power movements".

As for sunspots, as a ham radio operator I watch those, and the new sunspot cycle has been picking up over the last few months -- yes, it's still slow, but claims of a new Maunder Minimum seem a lot less likely now. Nor, again, does any of this address the accelerating breakup of the arctic ice cap. <br><br>Patz, a good collection of one-liners. <br><br>Bill, good to hear about the desuburbanization! I get a lot of emails from people who have the same sort of attitudes as your neighbor, and my response these days is to roll my eyes and suggest they try growing a garden. As for energy diagrams, you know, that might be a very interesting thing to apply to the rise and fall of systems theory as a quasipolitical movement. More on this later...<br><br>Loveandlight, as long as you're willing to say "the kind of civilization we have now," I have no quarrel at all. My problem with neoprimitivism is its habit of assuming that everything this side of hunter-gatherer society is uniformly evil. <br><br>Tiago, "infinite solar energy..." I really do need to do a post on that someday, as there's a crucial misunderstanding about the nature of economically useful energy embodied in that sort of phrase. Thank you, though, for your comments about science -- this is the same sort of thing I saw when I was at college, and everything I hear from people in scientific fields these days suggests it's only gotten worse since then. <br><br>Andrew, I've addressed that question at quite a bit of length elsewhere, especially in my recent book "The Ecotechnic Future" -- might be worth a look. <br><br>Llewellyn, very good! Yes, and you'll notice that the latest proposals allow carbon emissions to keep increasing up to 2020. By then, of course, the treaties can be rewritten to allow increases to continue up to 2050, and so on. You're also right that it always comes down to burning more fossil fuels; that's really the only way modern industrial society knows how to get anything done.<br><br>Don, I don't know what's currently in print, but some very good basic texts ought to be available on the used market -- I'm thinking particularly of Edward Kormondy's <i>Concepts of Ecology</i> (Prentice-Hall, 1969) or Eugene Odum's <i>Ecology</i> (Holt Rinehart and Winston, 1975). Both of these are short introductory textbooks meant for college undergraduates, light on math and good on basic concepts. <br><br>Tony, I think biochar's a technique very much worth exploring, but it's no magic bullet. Think for a moment about how much biomass would have to be converted into char daily to deal with the carbon emissions from <br>the 84 million barrels of oil the world burns every single day, for example, and the size of the challenge becomes a bit easier to grasp. As for mass movements, when people aren't willing to accept a low-carbon lifestyle, what makes you think they'll sign onto a mass movement with the goal of making people accept a low-carbon lifestyle?<br><br><a href=human-ecology-of-collapse.html#c7578605337780384878 title="comment permalink">12/10/09, 7:05 AM</a><br><br>

Your statements, at least in this context, seem unsupported. There are many, many smart people embarked on the quest. Not all quests are after the illusory, not all fail. Historically, when the time for a new technology has come, that technology arises from multiple inventors in parallel. We're not depending on a lone knight. We're depending on heros, perhaps, but humanity does not entirely lack them. Between "abandon hope" and "hope," only the latter message isn't suicidal. Yes, we have to be serious about the challenge.

Lester Brown lays out a much cheaper path to 80% cuts in 12 years. While his Plan B depends on things like plug-in hybrids and renewable energy trying to perpetuate some of what's wrong with our current setup, there are other paths -- like holistic land management which puts carbon into the ground through biodiversity while transforming our petro-heavy agricultural system -- that rely less on mining copper, silicone, etc. In fact, much of our reductions SAVE us money. Think $300 billion farm bill, ludicrous highway spending, trillions on the carbon-obscene Pentagon apparatus, etc. The industrial food and transportation system is also creating an epidemic of chronic disease costing us untold billions in health expenses.<br><br>2) That the global political apparatus is doing the bidding of the world's people. Are you kidding?!!!! Plain and simple, the only constituency our elected officials are representing are private interests who are well-organized and well-funded. Yes, there's a chasm that we must get beyond, for survival's sake. And the way across might not be to engineer an expensive shiny green bridge. But we still need a political solution. <br><br>Which brings me to my last point. You name socialists as one hopeless alternative. But you completely neglect the Greens as a possibility.<br><br>Now, I'm the first to admit that the Green Party in the United States has failed to live up to its foundational vision. But with a playing field tilted so sharply against it, it's pretty incredible that the Green Party is still around at all! <br><br>We need collective, bottom-up solutions to peak oil, climate change, and an inherently unsustainable economic system. We need political solutions. The Greens are all about alternatives to the failing paradigm of the growth economy. The Greens stand for an ecological political framework and represent one way that we can organize mass power in a decentralized, grassroots fashion.<br><br>Check out what they're doing in Copenhagen:<br>http://www.independentpoliticalreport.com/2009/12/in-copenhagen-global-greens-forum-to-address-global-warming/<br><br>It's a critical moment for our species.

While by your title it appears you are indeed a follower of druidic wisdom you also appear to have a good knowledge of some of the issues of sustainability affecting the human enterprise as currently configured. I have however only had space to read a few of your posts. <br><br>I was wondering if you were familiar with John Galls work on ‘systemantics’? He posits the idea that a system, or more precisely a system involving humans tends to become more complex and tends towards redirecting all resources towards its own existence, rather than towards the task it was originally set up to do. Also, it becomes more and more distant from the reality in which it is based, as the controlling part of the system receives less and less feedback from the outside world:<br><br>"where Ro equals the amount of Reality which fails to reach the Control Unit, and Rs equals the total amount of Reality presented to the system. The fraction Ro/Rs varies from zero (full awareness of outside reality) to unity (no reality getting through)." (From: "The Systems Bible: the Beginners Guide to systems large and small", John Gall, 2006. P.46-7)<br><br>This points also to a function of the system that is the human being, in that it too generally lives in something of a bubble reality. How big that bubble gets and how far it strays also depends on the amount of info getting through to the control system – via that other fantasy called the ego!<br><br>Are you familiar with the work of David Bohm who, amongst others, tried to build a new view of Reality with his ideas on the implicate order and the holomovement? Personally I think one of the real problems that is never (or rarely) discussed is that we are <i>still</i> looking at the world from the wrong perspectives, often involving an amalgam of pseudo religious thinking and outdated philosophies that are fundamentally incongruent with the way the world was and is now. Like never before we need a new view on reality. But given the human minds tendency towards attachment, its implementation would be nigh on impossible. Systemic collapse at all levels looks increasingly likely.<br><br>As for any predictions on the future, one only has to look at sub-Saharan Africa to see a pretty good model of how things will play out with little energy, falling food production, land and resource degradation and human nature in its most base mode. And that is not a comment on the good people of Africa, who have been robbed of their previously often sustainable cultures and inculcated into an industrial mindset without the benefits that industry brings but with all its problems.<br><br>As for your comment:<br>“Babaji, spiritual wisdom's a complex thing, and its application to the nuts and bolts of everyday life is rarely simple or univocal.”<br>I would argue the exact opposite. Spiritual wisdom is incredibly simple but the human mind (system) that loves complexity refuses to acknowledge it and goes of eating its own tail. The real difficulty lies in truly being with what is, including the awful and painful stuff. But that’s just my take on it – each to their own, eh?<br><br>Best Wishes,<br><br>Love,<br>Sid.<br><br><a href=human-ecology-of-collapse.html#c5657149872348498301 title="comment permalink">12/10/09, 11:27 AM</a><br><br>

As I see it, it's our culture's failure to do that, not any imperfection in the world, that's landed us in this mess. <br><br>Evan, no argument there! I think that groups that have preserved or recovered old technologies -- the folks at primitive skills gatherings among them -- are doing very useful work; it's the ideology, not the praxis, that gives me hiccups sometimes, and as you point out (and my experience supports this), the people who are doing the praxis aren't usually the ones pushing the ideology. <br><br>Unavailable, I've discussed the basis for my claim that alternative energy can't replace fossil fuels in literally dozens of posts here, and in both my books on peak oil. Since I'm writing weekly posts and not weekly booklength manuscripts, I don't have space to cover every topic previously mentioned. <br><br>Robert, the comment isn't hyperbole; a great many people in the Third World, and indeed in US inner cities, live in such conditions. The point I was trying to make is that the changes that will be required, if we are actually going to transition to a zero-net-carbon economy, will involve drastic changes of a kind that most Americans -- and indeed most climate change activists -- would find horrifying to contemplate. You're right that I don't live six to a room in a rat-infested tenement, but then I also don't claim that my lifestyle is an answer to climate change. It's not; it's simply the best compromise I've been able to find so far between lightening the burden I place on nature, on the one hand, and the work I do and the things I love, on the other.<br><br>Otromundo, what I've seen of the Green Party in the US gives me no reason to think it will influence our collective dialogue at all. Even for a US minor party, it's been remarkably disorganized and ineffective, and the position papers I've seen issued by Green Party groups have shown very little sign that anybody is ready to grapple with the severe limits we face. <br><br>I'm aware of Brown's claims, and find them dubious, to put things mildly. As to the insistence that all politicians (outside of your own party, presumably) are wholly owned by "special interests," yes, I know that's a popular claim these days; I'll be addressing it in more detail shortly. <br><br>Arabella, somebody ought to put together an anthology of this sort of thing. It'll make excellent gallows humor twenty years from now. <br><br>Draco, intelligence isn't an all-or-nothing thing. Human beings have a tolerably high level of intelligence; it just doesn't happen to be enough to keep us out of certain complex predicaments that kill a lot of us every so often.<br><br><a href=human-ecology-of-collapse.html#c3476675198102076516 title="comment permalink">12/10/09, 11:37 AM</a><br><br>

Hot topics adressed, JMG. Good work!<br><br>Second, I wanted to point out that when you say that society continually make the choices that destroy them, I wanted to say that that isn't necessarily true. Your basing that on past choices that have ruined societies, but what about all the choices that have been made that have brought us along this far? Look at the federalist/anti-federalist debates of the early american republic. We don't know what would have happened if we had not created a federal government, but it is fair to say that the possibility of societal collapse was present at that time, too. It wouldn't have been ecological, but it might have come politically, socially, or through military conquer. But we didn't collapse then, so perhaps we made a choice that didn't destroy us.<br><br>My point isn't to argue the past decisions and what could have been. My point is to say that I think we in the peak oil movement have to stop looking at our future as a future in which society <i>fails</i> or <i>succeeds</i> and start recognizing that a successful and secure future means a de-industrialized future.<br><br>You're right, no one wants to look at that or go there, but a lot of that resistance is because we assume that a future without an oil powered industry means a failure. We associate failure with misery and, as you illustrated, living in poverty with rat infested overcrowded apartments that we cram ourselves into for the sake of the preservation of our resources and alternative energy.<br><br>There are many alternatives to our current lifestyle that do not involve living a life of poverty. While numbers are disputed, some of the most probable estimates put the Native Hawaiian population at 800,000-900,000 in pre-contact times. They weren't impoverished. They weren't disease ridden. They weren't military nothings. They weren't unintelligent. They also weren't anarchic, socialists, capitalists, or run by dictatorships. While they weren't perfect by any means and had an extremely deep awareness of their racial superiority and were largely oppressive toward women, they weren't ruining their environment or in societal collapse. There were many changes going on with the cultural hierarchies at that time, but to say it was collapse is a stretch of the imagination. While I am not advicating a return to "the old," I am suggesting that perhaps the Hawaiians were on to something that we can learn from in our time today.<br><br>So I agree that we cannot sustain industrial society with alternative energy. But I am suggesting that we in the peak oil movement avoid getting caught in the mindset that a non-industrial society is an impoverished, anarchic, and miserable state of existence. <br><br>.... no wonder no one in the mainstream is listening to us...<br><br>mat<br><br><a href=human-ecology-of-collapse.html#c6859499890940454204 title="comment permalink">12/10/09, 1:23 PM</a><br><br>

There obviously is no such thing as a magic bullet (vis-a-vis global warming, among other things), except perhaps for a global economic collapse, which obviously would lead to lower CO2 emissions.... I'm actually intrigued by your comment on systems theory, because that informs my thinking... in the most recent update to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Limits-Growth-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/193149858X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1260556284&amp;sr=8-1" rel=nofollow>Limits to Growth</a>, the authors make a good case for the need to embrace a range of solutions, from technical to ethical.<br><br>I don't want to mis-characterize what you said, but I think there's a way to interpret your words that says "well, it won't solve the problem, so why bother doing it?" In the context of the <a href=http://www.350.org rel=nofollow>350.org</a> movement, we know we've already surpassed planetary limits regarding greenhouse gas emissions, so in addition to emitting less (perhaps by "failing", i.e. collapsing), it behooves us to invent and implement solutions that <i>also</i> sequester CO2. The danger is that such solutions might create new problems (most geo-engineering solutions seem to fall into that category). However, biochar has great possibility, I think, for being a technique that has <i>multiple</i> positive benefits (all those things I said in my earlier comment).<br><br>Regarding mass movements, you ask <i>"when people aren't willing to accept a low-carbon lifestyle, what makes you think they'll sign onto a mass movement with the goal of making people accept a low-carbon lifestyle?"</i> I don't accept your basic premise, there. I can only speak for myself and the people I know in my community (Lancaster, PA), when I say I see a lot of people, first, intellectually accepting that a lower-consumption lifestyle can be more fulfilling than a high-consumption lifestyle. Second, I see a significant number of people, especially those my age (mid-20s to low-30s), completely rejecting the lifestyle choices and, more to the point, the <i>life goals</i> of our elders. Give 'em 30 years and they might turn into a blight similar to elder failed hippies, but right now there is much promise... and, after all, there isn't 30 years. It is rapidly becoming apparent that humanity has exceeded its sustainable limits, and I don't see how our so-called "leaders" can continue to deny that reality. They are becoming caricatures of themselves.<br><br>This comment is becoming overlong, but I also want to suggest that I have no desire of being a part of a movement that <i>makes</i> people do, or accept, anything. That would be another case of "the chief cause of problems is solutions." A "solution" that works by coercion hardly deserves the moniker. I would, however, much like to persuade people that there is a better way.<br><br><a href=human-ecology-of-collapse.html#c6558703234796827779 title="comment permalink">12/11/09, 10:49 AM</a><br><br>

Think of the closest two thousand people to you right now, and then imagine that one of them survives -- and it's not you.

It helps to be in Amish country! Take a wider look around, though, and you'll find a huge number of Americans (and others) unwilling to do without the very real benefits of fossil fuel use. <br><br>As for biochar, the fact that it's not a magic bullet certainly doesn't make it useless. It'll be interesting to see if it has the same effects on crops in temperate climates that it has in rain forests. <br><br>Vera, that's fodder for a post all to itself. Still, as a very rough measure, go over your household budget, and imagine that your income was just cut by 85% while all your bills remained the same. Work out what kind of lifestyle you could manage in that situation. How willing would you be to accept the change to that situation voluntarily? And, yes, it would come to that, or close -- when I do a post on that subject (and I will, probably in January), I'll cover the reasoning.<br><br><a href=human-ecology-of-collapse.html#c1974384915032467330 title="comment permalink">12/11/09, 4:43 PM</a><br><br>

It could be a potent unifier and galvanizer of necessary community action. But recent decades have seen a persistent evangelical attack on science in the character of evolutionary biology, and by extension on the related disciplines of palaeontology and geology as well. The reputation of science depends in great part on the self-evident power of the technological productions flowing from it, and the great improvements in quality of life which those have created. As technological civilization declines and those indices of well being do so also, the reputation of science could well descend with them, and that wouldn't be a good thing. The scientific paradigm could be displaced by... what? Rapture theology? Sorry if this is rather off-topic for this week, but I think it's a real concern that needs to be addressed. We're consistently talking here about people's underlying beliefs concerning the nature of reality, and these will surely undergo a radical transformation as that reality changes in a fashion which is not likely to be to their liking. In the long term, I see the scientific rationalist worldview as distinctly endangered. Even now, look how the wingnuts are attacking a scientific institution and capitalizing on its public embarrassment for short-term political gains.<br><br><a href=human-ecology-of-collapse.html#c7992600353836086149 title="comment permalink">12/12/09, 12:03 PM</a><br><br>

Thinking through the results of exponential growth is a good example. The kinds of thinking we're good at are the ones that had an evolutionary advantage in our species' history, and that's far from a complete toolkit.<br><br>Otse, basically, yes. Our culture insists that summer must be followed by uber-summer, and that by uber-uber-summer, and so on up the grand scale of progress; thus we've wasted the autumn harvest under the mistaken impression that it would just keep on getting bigger and better forever. Now winter's upon us. <br><br>Edde, it's certainly possible; my wife and I have a European-sized energy footprint, which amounts to a bit more than yours. To do it, though, we've had to give up a lot of things most Americans can't imagine living without. <br><br>Gardenserf, welcome to the Report!<br><br>Kevin, the scientific rationalist worldview is not merely endangered, it's dying. Still, it won't be today's media-manufactured fundamentalisms that replace it -- they've basically shot their bolt at this point, and are losing ground as fast as the rationalist materialists are (which helps to explain why Richard Dawkins sounds remarkably like Pat Robertson these days). I would encourage you to look for ways that the scientific method can be passed to the future -- that's the important thing; the rest can be rediscovered if the method survives.<br><br><a href=human-ecology-of-collapse.html#c6280230486865001321 title="comment permalink">12/12/09, 4:00 PM</a><br><br>

Lacking fossil fuels, I doubt human population would have exploded the way it has, simply because this sort of population bubble never happened in pre-fossil fuel times. The question of what exactly fossil fuels did to foster population growth on such an exorbitant scale is another matter; my guess is that many different impacts played roles of their own, with the expansion of carrying capacity through long-distance trade as one major factor. Still, it's definitely something that could use some research.<br><br><a href=human-ecology-of-collapse.html#c4491300816866093796 title="comment permalink">12/14/09, 7:09 AM</a><br><br>

His work in contemporary history however,in my view,is good scholarship. Works like The Washington Connection and third World Fascism vol.1 and 2; The Fateful Triangle; American Power and the New Mandarins; A New Generation Draws the Line, are helpful in trying to understand the world. I've read transcripts of some of his talks and they too are generally historically informative. I will say that he may fall short on an ecological perspective perhaps for the same reason that you point out in "The Wealth of Nature" that David Ricardo missed the point on the abuse of land.<br> <br>Such works as Necessary Illusions and his book with co-author Edward Herman, Manufacturing Consent is a good analysis of the mass media: as they point out it's a close approximation of a "complex" social institution . The "propaganda model" of the media is a useful tool. Let's be honest there are few public intellectuals who are willing to admit that they have privileged positions in society and therefore feel an obligation to educate. <br><br>Your Archdruid Report is a way of teaching people "intellectual self-defense" a strategy few who read this blog would argue with. Now,the uncomfortable question I am embarrassed to ask because I'm unaware of the "failed strategy for social change" that Chomsky has advocated. Aside from his urging people to think for themselves and question power, because most is illegitimate,could you briefly explain it or point me to essays or books that can?<br><br>I recently viewed a film called "Blind Spot" and there's a physicist by the name of Albert Bartlett who expressed his shame at coming to realize,late in life, that there was no one in Washington looking after things.

(As Kiashu said, "not really...") Albeit a minor point in the essay, it was disappointing, and distracting. And if I had to hazard a guess, I would wager you didn't read those e-mails.<br><br>This week's commentary strikes me as entirely more conventional than I normally expect from you. I can go to RealClearpolitics or the Huffington Post for blustering about present day political structures. Also, I know you don't think highly of renewables, but is it really necessary to repeat the strawman that renewable electricity is about "running a modern industrial society", or the nearly irrelevant fact that renewables will "have to be paid for out of existing supplies" (as if anything doesn't)? Gail the Actuary puts forward these points every couple of weeks at TheOilDrum, so the niche is filled. Personally, to use your phrase, I think it's a case of asking the wrong question about renewables... <br><br>In addition, I also agree with Vic's comment about Chomsky. (Where's the failure? What's the alternative approach that's somehow more successful?) He's basically built his second career doing the same thing you do; asking people to think for themselves and not to be fooled by dominant narratives.<br><br><a href=human-ecology-of-collapse.html#c746279930732829956 title="comment permalink">12/15/09, 2:22 PM</a><br><br>

Can't wait for Part 2. What we are doing up in Ferndale, WA is building a sustainable ag model. Right now we are stuck in the modern business model (grow what you can sell), while transitioning into the postmodern business model (you can sell all you can grow). This transition means tiller use for now but dropping that in the future. My calorie input/outputs in 2009 are 1.07 million calories (i.e. kilocalories, following the nutritionists' convention) to produce 3.66 million calories of fruit, grain and vegetables. I measure my labor at 125 calories/hour and my gasoline at 31,000 calories/gallon. At .91 million calories/year for human adults, I grew enough this year to feed 4 people. Once I finish threshing my spelt and barley, I expect this number to go to 4.50. This model is intended for a future where 20% of the adult working population are fulltime farmers using sustainable methods. For me sustainable = more output than input, measured in calories. If anyone is interested, my website is www.fafarm.org.

More precisely, it's part of the strategy of mainstream liberal political activism, which has had very few successes since the right learned how to run rings around it in the mid-1970s. Sure, we can all read another round of books and articles, or listen to another round of speeches and podcasts, about the horrible abuses committed by the people we don't like, and how much better things would be if our friends ran things...but at the end of the day, what has that accomplished?

I sometimes view the films or listen to the podcast in an attempt to find more options and ideas. Believe me this opportunity is closing fast. Look, you've got me on Chomsky I think he's a good historian, and his analysis of the media seems to fit. I think Jeavons and Seymour are good gardeners, I think Wendell Barry, is a good essayist, Mike down the road is a good fiddle player. I think your a good Druid. I think the ideas of Leo Strauss, are interesting I don't agree with them but they are interesting. You try to decipher information and prepare yourself? Because of reading you, I've been able to collect,Roszak, Spengler, Toynbee, and others. These ideas help in my view. My knowledge of US political and philosophical thought grows as does my provincial. Canada is indeed a province to the US and as Tainter suggest one peer polity will simply swallow the other up if it can. Our Prime Minister visits Asia and tells them Canada has the resources they need. And in the small town I'm close to people wait for the next opportunity to attack the boreal forest, and pound the living hell out of the topsoil. That's certainly not thinking in an ecological paradigm? But I am: and I try to tell others to do the same, it seems to me the only thing to do right now. Once the work's done I let my mind pore over these people it helps during the dark months. Absurd people,created by an absurd culture create political winds that buffet us both around.This is how I cope.
