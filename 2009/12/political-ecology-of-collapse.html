<span style=font-size:130%>Part Two: Weishaupt’s Fallacy</span><br><br>Nostalgia’s a funny thing; you never know what’s going to fill the place of Proust’s madeleine and catapult you back to memories of some other time. A little over a year ago, I had a reminder of that while visiting the <a href=http://www.uheac.org/ >Upland Hills Ecological Awareness Center</a> in Oakland County, Michigan. The path from the parking lot wandered through a lovely autumn woodland, then turned a corner and deposited me back in 1980.<br><br>In those days I was passionately interested in the appropriate technology movement, to the extent of spending the better part of three years working part time on an organic farm, learning the uses of cold frames, a solar greenhouse, compost bins, and double-dug garden beds. Every cliché you can imagine about late-70s communes was present and accounted for: wood smoke and mud, naked bodies in a creaky wood-fired sauna, goats and chickens in the pasture, and a handbuilt wind turbine that went whuppeta-whuppeta and churned out a trickle of twelve-volt current whenever the breeze picked up.<br><br>The center at Upland Hills was a good deal cleaner, and the goats and the naked bodies were nowhere to be seen, but the esthetic was much the same. Their wind turbine sounded a silky pup-pup-pup atop an honest-to-Fuller octet truss tower, and the center itself was what all of us at the Outback Farm dreamed of inhabiting someday: a big comfortable earth-bermed shelter with passive solar heating and old-fashioned round photovoltaic cells soaking up the sunlight. When we went inside, I half expected to see a circle of scruffy longhairs sitting on pillows around the latest issue of Coevolution Quarterly, excitedly discussing the latest innovations from Zomeworks and the New Alchemy Institute.<br><br>Nostalgia aside, there's a lot to be learned from the rise and fall of appropriate tech in the 1970s, and one of its lessons bears directly on the theme of this series of posts. For many of the people involved in it back then, appropriate tech was the inevitable wave of the future; nearly everyone assumed that energy costs would continue to rise as the limits to growth clamped down with increasing force, making anything but Ecotopia tantamount to suicide. A formidable body of thought backed those conclusions, and the core of that body of thought was systems theory.<br><br>Nowadays, the only people who pay attention to systems theory are specialists in a handful of obscure fields, and it can be hard to remember that forty years ago systems theory had the same cachet that more recently gathered around fractals and chaos theory. Born of a fusion between ecology, cybernetics, and a current in contemporary philosophy best displayed in Jan Smuts' <i>Holism and Evolution</i>, systems theory argued that complex systems -- <i>all</i> complex systems – shared certain distinctive traits and behaviors, so that insights gained in one field of study could be applied to phenomena in completely different fields that shared a common degree of complexity.<br><br>It had its weaknesses, to be sure, but on the whole, systems theory did exactly what theories are supposed to do – it provided a useful toolkit for making sense of part of the universe of human experience, posed plenty of fruitful questions for research, and proved useful in a sizable range of practical applications. As popular theories sometimes do, though, it became associated with a position in the cultural struggles of the time, and as some particularly unfortunate theories do, it got turned into a vehicle for a group of intellectuals who craved power. Once that happened, systems theory became another casualty of Weishaupt's Fallacy.<br><br>Those of my readers who don't pay attention to conspiracy theory may not recognize the name of Adam Weishaupt; those who do pay attention to conspiracy theory probably "know" a great deal about him that doesn't happen to be true. He was a professor of law at the University of Ingolstadt in Bavaria in the second half of the eighteenth century, and he found himself in an awkward position between the exciting new intellectual adventures coming out of Paris and the less than exciting intellectual climate in conservative, Catholic Bavaria. In 1776, he and four of his grad students founded a private society for enthusiasts of the new Enlightenment thought; they went through several different names for their club before finally settling on one that stuck: the Bavarian Illuminati.<br><br>Yes, <i>those</i> Bavarian Illuminati.<br><br>There were a fair number of people interested in avant-garde ideas in and around Bavaria just then, and. before too long, the Illuminati had several hundred members. This gave Weishaupt and his inner circle some grandiose notions about where all this might lead. Pretty soon, they hoped,all the movers and shakers in Bavaria – not to mention the other microkingdoms into which Germany was divided at that time – would join the Illuminati and stuff their heads full of Voltaire and Rousseau, and then the whole country would become, well, illuminated.<br><br>They were still telling themselves that when the Bavarian government launched a series of police raids that broke the back of the organization. Weishaupt got out of Bavaria in time, but many of his fellow Illuminati were not so lucky, and a great deal of secret paperwork got scooped up by the police and published in lavish tell-all books that quickly became bestsellers all over Europe. That was the end of the Illuminati, but not of their reputation; reactionaries found that blaming the Illuminati for everything made great copy, not least because they weren't around any more and so could be redefined with impunity – liberal, conservative, Marxist, capitalist, evil space lizards, you name it.<br><br>The problem with Professor Weishaupt's fantasy of an illuminated Bavaria was a bit of bad logic that has been faithfully repeated by intellectuals seeking power ever since: the belief, as sincere as it is silly, that if you have the right ideas, you are by definition smarter than the system you are trying to control. That's Weishaupt's Fallacy. Because Weishaupt and his fellow Illuminati were convinced that the conservative forces in Bavaria were a bunch of clueless boors, they were totally unprepared for the counterblow that followed once the Bavarian government figured out who the Illuminati were and what they were after.<br><br>For a more recent example, consider the rise and fall of the neoconservative movement, which stormed into power in the United States in 2000 boldly proclaiming the arrival of a "new American century," and proceeded to squander what remained of America's wealth and global reputation in a series of foreign and domestic policy blunders that have set impressive new standards for political fecklessness. The neoconservatives were convinced that they understood the world better than anybody else. That conviction was the single most potent factor behind their failure; when mainstream conservatives (not to mention everybody else!) tried to warn them where their fantasies of remaking the Middle East in America's image would inevitably end, the neoconservatives snorted in derision and marched straight on into the disaster they were making for themselves, and of course for the rest of us as well.<br><br>Systems theory was a victim of the same fallacy. The systems movement, to coin a label for the heterogeneous group of thinkers and policy wonks that made systems theory its banner, had ambitions no less audacious than the neoconservatives, though aimed in a completely different direction. Their dream was world systems management. Such leading figures in the movement as Jay Forrester of MIT and Aurelio Peccei of the Club of Rome agreed that humanity's impact on the planet had become so great that methods devised for engineering and corporate management – in which, not coincidentally, they were expert – had to be put to work to manage the entire world.<br><br>The study that led to the 1973 publication of <i>The Limits to Growth</i> was one product of this movement. Sponsored by Peccei's Club of Rome and carried out by a team led by one of Forrester's former Ph.D. students, it applied systems theory to the task of making sense of the future, and succeeded remarkably well. As Graham Turner's study "A Comparison Of The Limits to Growth With Thirty Years of Reality" (CSIRO, 2008) points out, the original study's baseline "Standard Run" scenario matches the observed reality of the last three and a half decades far more exactly than rival scenarios.<br><br>It's not often remembered, though, that the Club of Rome followed up <i>The Limits to Growth</i> with a series of further studies, all basically arguing that the problems outlined in the original study could be solved by planetary management on the part of a systems-savvy elite. The same notions can be found in dozens of similar books from the same era – indeed, it's hard to think of a systems thinker with any public presence in the 1970s who didn't publish at least one book proposing some kind of worldwide systems management as the only alternative to a very messy future.<br><br>It's only fair to stress the role that idealism and the best intentions played in all this. Still, the political dimensions shouldn't be ignored. Forrester, Peccei, and their many allies were, among other things, suggesting that a great deal of effective power be given to them, or to people who shared their values and goals. Since the systems movement was by no means politically neutral – quite the contrary, it aligned itself forcefully with specific ideological positions in the fractured politics of the decade – that suggestion was bound to evoke a forceful response from the entire range of opposing interests.<br><br>The Reagan revolution of 1980 saw the opposition seize the upper hand, and the systems movement was among the big losers. Hardball politics have always played a significant role in public funding of research in America, so it should have come as no surprise when Reagan's appointees all but shut off the flow of government grants into the entire range of initiatives that had gathered around the systems theory approach. From appropriate tech to alternative medicine to systems theory itself, entire disciplines found themselves squeezed out of the government feed trough, while scholars who pursued research that could be used against the systems agenda reaped the benefits of that stance. Clobbered in its most vulnerable spot – the pocketbook – the systems movement collapsed in short order.<br><br>What made this implosion all the more ironic is that a systems analysis of the systems movement itself, and its relationship to the wider society, might have provided a useful warning. Very few of the newborn institutions in the systems movement were self-funding; from prestigious think tanks to neighborhood energy-conservation schemes, most of them subsisted on government grants, and thus were in the awkward position of depending on the social structures they hoped to overturn. That those structures could respond homeostatically to oppose their efforts might, one would think, be obvious to people who were used to the strange loops and unintended consequences that pervade complex systems.<br><br>Still, Weishaupt's Fallacy placed a massive barrier in the way of such a realization. Read books by many of the would-be global managers of the 1970s and you can very nearly count on being bowled over by the scent of intellectual arrogance. The possibility that the system they hoped to manage might, in effect, have been more clever than they were probably crossed very few minds. Yet that's how things turned out; at the end of the day, the complex system that was American society had reacted, exactly as systems theory would predict, to neutralize a force that threatened to push it out of its preferred state.<br><br>Unfortunately that reaction slammed the door on resources that might have made the transition ahead of us less difficult. Set aside the hubris that convinced too many systems theorists that they ought to manage the world, and systems theory itself is an extremely effective toolkit of ideas and practices, and a good many of the things that moved in harmony with systems theory – 1970s appropriate tech being a fine example – are well worth dusting off and putting to use right now. At the same time, though, the process that excluded them needs to be understood, and not just because the same process could repeat itself just as easily with some new set of sustainability initiatives. The homeostatic behavior of complex systems also casts an unexpected light on one of the major conundrums of contemporary life, the location of political power in industrial society – the theme of the final part of this series.

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c3097370186264488817></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/18140148696445122537 rel=nofollow>Evan</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Could it be that we've already crossed some major thresholds when it comes to the fracturing and dissolution of centralized power? The US government remains fairly well seated in its power, both from the perspective of arms as well as propaganda, but at the same time it seems utterly unable to really make any "big" moves with concern to domestic or international policy. Essentially, the Obama administration is just repeating the framework established by all the administrations prior, and not seeking to really get any major work done that could ease the present situation.<br><br>It's pretty clear to me that whether it's talks about the climate in Copenhagen or health care in the States, there's a bunch of argument and spectacle centering around reforms and policy changes that are so minor that they would remain completely ineffective at tackling the problems they are supposed to solve. No international agreement at this point on climate could do much of anything to reduce carbon emissions or mitigate climate change because the massive infrastructural projects that would need to begin tomorrow would be beyond the monetary and energetic power of most governments. Likewise, a health care reform bill that would seriously attempt to change health care in the US for the better would essentially require a de facto destruction of much of the "health care industry" and the money it generates. This is not something the US has the financial strength to undertake.<br><br>My point is that I think we've reached the point where federal or international governing bodies no longer have the ability to institute major changes in their respective jurisdictions. State, county, and municipal governments, on the other hand are much more flexible and able to institute policies that might prove useful for energy descent scenarios.<br><br>This is perhaps not the best example, but the issue of cannabis legalization comes to mind. Just yesterday legalization efforts in California submitted a petition with enough signatures to ensure that on the 2010 ballot Californians will vote on whether to legalize cannabis or not.<br><br>I bring this up because cannabis legalization is entirely intractable on the federal level, in spite of the boon it would be -- Less energy and effort wasted in an unwinnable war on what are essentially cultural taboos, and a potentially valuable crop for nutrition and fiber. It wouldn't mean an end to all this civilization's ills or really even a beginning to their end (much to the chagrin of hemptopia stoners everywhere), but it would be a sensible and seemingly easy enough thing for this society to choose. A cut-the-fat operation, if you will. But instead of this being handled on the federal level, a state will likely vote on a law that glaringly contradicts federal law.<br><br>Again, a poor example, but I think it goes to show that we will see many states, counties, and municipalities instituting laws pass laws directly contradicting those of their superior bodies, and their superior bodies will be unable to do anything but acquiesce or look the other way. Maybe the locus of power is dividing and moving down the hierarchy? This would seem logical from a perspective of energy.<br><br><a href=political-ecology-of-collapse.html#c3097370186264488817 title="comment permalink">12/16/09, 9:10 PM</a><br><br>

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c6132740981392730405></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/11281843004028098161 rel=nofollow>aangel</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>It's possible to apply systems thinking even to the process of introducing the idea of systems thinking. We start by recognizing that, for all our supposed free-will, we humans tend to act collectively in entirely predictable ways. We are — ultimately — just another system of molecules the universe has set up, albeit one that is deluded enough to think it actually has free will.<br><br>Unfortunately, the proponents of systems theor apparently did not apply their thinking to the process of introducing their new ideas, nor did the Illuminati and thus they each received the fate they did.<br><br>It's wise to remember that new conversations introduced into the network of existing human conversations very often elicit the reaction the systems theorists received. Proponents of any new conversation must be prepared for when they trigger the immune system of the existing ones. That is because conversations defend themselves.<br><br>We are seeing this right now with climate change deniers. The deniers are an expression of the prevailing BAU conversations defending the current system. We saw it with women's suffrage and the abolishment of slavery, too. Every advance has an existing, opposing conversation that reacts like t-cells to a bodily intruder.<br><br>In fact, it's often very dangerous business to introduce a new conversation. In another time the systems theorists might have been lucky that they kept their lives. Perhaps some of the Illuminati did lose their lives (you didn't say) because often the people who do introduce a new conversation not infrequently lose theirs. Assassinations, for instance, are a result of the existing conversation protecting itself by extinguishing the propagator of the new one. Police raids are another, less harsh way of protecting a conversation.<br><br>Sometimes I stand in wonder at the progress we have made when I consider the incredible constraining force existing conversations have.<br><br>Unfortunately, much of this progress has begun to unwind and will continue to do so. It's not only jet travel and high technology that are a function of excess abundant energy — new conversations are, too.<br><br>What will be left are the fundamental conversations that seem to run humans. They are very easy to spot in times of stress or anger. They are the conversations of scarcity rather than generosity and tribalism rather than collaboration.<br><br>The subnetwork of conversations in which we choose to place ourselves will be a very good predictor of an individual's success as we move through collapse. We each need to choose them carefully.<br><br><a href=political-ecology-of-collapse.html#c6132740981392730405 title="comment permalink">12/16/09, 10:11 PM</a><br><br>

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c5706310530033250931></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/09130634176057923895 rel=nofollow>Tiago</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Lots of food for thought, thanks.<br><br>A few comments:<br><br>1. The left mythology (or "liberal" as it is said in the USA) is completely attached to the notions of being in possession of the absolute truth and fairness plus that a "strong center" controled by the vanguard people will "distribute goodness and fairness".<br><br>The roots of this are, in my opinion, somewhat different in Europe and in the USA. In Europe it is probably connected to the triumph of the leninist variety of marxism (uber-centralist, uber-totalitarian) against more distributed alternatives like anarcho-syndicalism and such.<br>In the USA I see completely different causes: liberal symbolic victories are connected to federal victories (abolition of slavery, civil rights act, Rowe vs Wade) and the conservatives paint themselves as anti-federal (which is really just a propaganda exercise, in my opinion).<br><br>The left-psyche is so attached to the idea of strong central govt, that if you suggest anything different, you will be frowned upon. It is also attached to this idea that we are gods: we are clever enough to design the good society from the top. Worse than that it is attached to this idea of a single, absolute, total Good.<br><br>In fact many liberals/leftists are very anti-equality in the sense that they see themselves as smarter than most of their fellow Homo sapeins.<br><br>And they parrot a lot about diversity but they tend to see that a single political and social environment is the solution to all the world's problems.<br><br>2. The so-called scientific institutions are very dependent on govt funding. This make those institutions easily controllable by political agendas, but also will make those institutions invest a lot in propaganda in order grab influence. Being able to grab funding (i.e. survive) means being able to prove that you are important for the fad of the times. The current fad of the times is obviously climate change. I work in an extremely interdisciplinary framework and it is impressive how everybody justifies their research on climate change: Mathematics? We need better understanding of the maths behind climate modeling. Computer Science? Parallel computing is needed to run climate models. Investigating reptiles? They are good markers of temperature change. Epidemiology? Climate change affects the progressing of disease. And so on.<br><br>Don't see this as a jab against climate change. It is not. It is just the observation that the so called scientific institutions are above all a social, abstract construction. Fully dependent of the world around them in the sense that they depend on political/propaganda leverage for financial survival (as opposed to say, somebody who sells grain, who satisfies a very short term need).<br><br>The maximum example is research in economics: You could not publish a paper in a respected journal if you were out of the ortodoxy (and in this case ortodoxy meant growth-ortodoxy).<br><br>What is researched is mostly socially and politically decided. People who fetichize science as a world of very pure people doing very pure things are deluded.<br><br>And if members of the fundamentalist church of science are going to attack my arguments I simply ask you to do this: think about what happens in economics. If you believe science is dogma, then you would have to accept that the economic consensus around growth (being so scientific) is beyond discussion. Or do you cherry-pick the "science" that agrees with your agenda? Because if you do, then it seems that you use "science" just as an authoritarian argument, effectively throwing away any respect for autonomous reasoning and pluralism.<br><br>3. The issue of Systems theory. I was always put back in researching it because of the people that I know around it are so arrogant! They really believe that they know more. That they are illuminated. That puts me off. But the concept of homeostasis is absolutely fundamental to understand the world. And the theory in itself seems really interesting.<br><br><a href=political-ecology-of-collapse.html#c5706310530033250931 title="comment permalink">12/17/09, 3:46 AM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c1575314087293490161></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/06729916498803087639 rel=nofollow>galacticsurfer</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>To draw a comparison to private life, I find that hobbies and personal interests I can pursue in my free time without any trouble but when I get too far out of line at work I become irrelevant and won't last long at that job. Soft skills, sensitivity to the flow of events right now is important as the paychecks, bills have to be met this month and not in some 5 year plan time-frame. <br><br>Similarly if our PO adjustment plan is so radical that we don't fit into the greater picture of society we will be irrelevant at that point in time. Climbing down from a high energy lifestyle and still being able to function in society is a large adjustment if we are still to be able to pay the bills, eat, remain married, keep our kids happy, etc. <br><br>I could skip off to India tomorrow with a rice bowl for example or try somehow to live extremely low energy without cash but I can give up any connection to other people immediately and will probably get in the way of the law and have severe health problems or what else I don't know. <br><br>Essentially such experiments as in the 70s are useful but anyone knowing they are "right" going against reality is bound to get their comeuppance as the system always moves around the center with a pendulum type movement to the right then the left and repeat. We saw this with the severe oil price correction. Everything isn't one way. People adjust and then move on and so on. Incomes and available resources will just keep falling and people in the main will adjust according to need and not according to ideological zeal, except for the freaks who will go around with hairshirts or solar cells long before necessary or mainstream and might get caught out losing money or missing an opportunity. <br><br>For example if you were an investor who knew that the market has to fall eventually to near zero but had not foreseen the current Bear market rally and stayed in cash and gold since march you would look pretty stupid. Not that I care too much about that sort of thing, just as an obvious example.<br><br><a href=political-ecology-of-collapse.html#c1575314087293490161 title="comment permalink">12/17/09, 4:26 AM</a><br><br>

But here is my perspective of what was going on in Europe with the onset of the technological and industrial <i>revolution</i>. However excited but imprudent intellectual passions might have ever been, they were never close to taking political power, I guess. On the other hand, intellectual power is one of the few that might look scary to dynasties of real power or wealth. So I good deal of confusion has to be expected regarding popular understanding of strengths and dangers of intellectual curiosity, since clarity is not always (if ever?!) politically welcome.<br><br>Yet the power balance was momentously shifting in European (and colonial) societies, as industrial production was developing dramatically. Perhaps never before merchants or manufacturers were gaining preeminent powers in the economy and social life. (Though financial <i>craft</i> might be another story.) The difference between capitalism and feudalism is in the power of capital and industry. Somehow the feudal <i>system</i> could not match or resist compounding industrial developments. Some power (and rental) redistribution between aristocracy and industrialists was needed - for that we had the French Revolution and other reforms. This process must be continuing till now - though with the end of globalization and other utilization some final stage should be in sight. By now we have a kind of financial totalitarism across the world.<br><br>I conjecture that the faulty “urge” of <i>smart intellectuals</i> for “systematic” power is more a useful myth than a real phenomenon. Those who know power probably prefer to be poorly visible. And it does not look hard at all to fake some competitions, clashes of interest, even intellectual fallacies. If smart people indeed go blindly wrong so easily, wouldn’t anyone with influence or good resources think of playing with that? How do we tell, how much posture is there in political elites? How well do they <i>play</i> healthcare reforms or climate treaties?<br><br>So, however Weishaupt’s closest friends fared, his kind of club appears to have been very convenient for socializing between the new wealth holders of industrial revolution. And they may have liked it to keep their powerful fellowships private. I am not saying that many of them know everything. But if you like to imagine foolish <i>overreach</i> of system theorists, or particular bias of climate scientists, please consider the possibility of determined strategies of holders of real power for a perspective, and how influential are <b>their</b> follies.<br><br>The interpretation of the <i>Reagan revolution</i> is just annoying. Those guys were already bulldozing new and established systems (and theorists) in Chile and many <i>developing</i> places. Yes, they did not like the “Club of Rome” reports, and they <i>handled that</i> without even pretending of giving them a chance. They were on the way to the <i>freedom</i> of financial rampage that we have now - and who could stop them? For what I know about the US social conditions of 30-40 years ago, the Reagan <i>system practitioners</i> overwhelmed that <i>complex homeostatic</i> lifestyle dramatically enough.<br><br><a href=political-ecology-of-collapse.html#c6101209690870544215 title="comment permalink">12/17/09, 4:35 AM</a><br><br>

Those who have power lose faith in the system and those without power lose faith in those who do have power. The erosion of legitimacy in institutions would be one of the worst things to accompany the decline. In its place comes not tolerant, pluralistic religions but fanatical zealotry with the Book of Revelations as the playbook and criminal gangs, who, while not offering a belief system offer a sense of belonging they increasingly won't find from the state. <br>How do we stop that from happening? How can any system go on without hope? I have just finished reading<br><br>The Closing of the Western Mind by Charles Freeman discussing the adoption of Christianity in the later roman empire. It outlays a clear and coherent argument that as the empire got weaker, Christianity got stronger and not the tolerant Christianity of earlier Christian authors but a gloomy, fanatical one which revealed in elevating ignorance, the destruction of enemies and the destruction of any knowledge which might conflict with the worldview of the orthodoxy espoused by the church.<br><br>I know the preservation of knowledge is a subject you are passionate on, I am worried that if history repeats or just rhymes, some new organisations will take up power in the space left vacant by the crumbling state who will seek to destroy knowledge that isnt consistent with the religious view they support.<br><br><a href=political-ecology-of-collapse.html#c2170777174704842337 title="comment permalink">12/17/09, 5:07 AM</a><br><br>

Afterward, he tried explaining this to farmers he worked for and they all thought he was a bit nuts. So, he decided the only way to show people what he meant was to create a living example. He went back to his father's farm and started what he called "Natural Farming", farming without intervention. For 30 years he said, he asked himself what he could take out of the equation to reach this natural state, building off of each "mistake" he made along the way.

Mind you, you'll find the same sort of evasions in the writings of current would-be world managers of the David Korten variety. <br><br>Evan, I see your crystal ball is in working order. I'll be discussing many of these same points in next week's post. <br><br>Medved, no, either way it's a mess. That's why change has to start with individuals changing their own lives; lacking that, nothing is going to work. <br><br>Aangel, my only quibble with your comment is that new conversations are not a function of technology. They had some amazing new conversations in ancient Athens and Elizabethan London, after all. <br><br>Coyote and Frank, thank you. <br><br>RAS, yes, it's an easy trap. I'll have some suggestions for avoiding it down the road a bit. <br><br>Tiago, all this corresponds very closely to my own experience. I had the advantage of being introduced to systems theory by teachers who managed to dodge the pandemic intellectual arrogance of the field -- the fact that they were teaching at an undistinguished public university might have had something to do with that -- and so could present systems thinking as a useful tool instead of a ticket to godhood; still, I've seen the other way too often. <br><br>Surfer, well put. The challenge, as I see it, is finding ways to make necessary changes that don't evoke the backlash. <br><br>Das Monde, if you found my comments on the Reagan revolution annoying, next week's post is going to annoy the stuffing out of you. The point of bringing up the fallacies I'm discussing is to provide current activists with ways to avoid the mistakes that wrecked earlier projects of the same kind. If that's offensive to you, well, I don't see any way that can be helped. <br><br>Ajmacey, Freeman's book is a bit one-sided. The Christian church also carried out a great deal of cultural salvage and conservation; much of the classical culture that made it to the Middle Ages did so because Christian monks and nuns laboriously copied manuscripts by hand right through the worst parts of the Dark Ages. Still, in general terms, you're right; the collapse of legitimacy that accompanies the decline and fall of a civilization can provide an opening to some pretty monstrous things. <br><br>Thardiust, thanks for the link. <br><br>Glider, Technocracy never got large or powerful enough to be a threat to anybody, and so it was cheaper to ignore it. That's not always a bad place to be, so long as your goals don't require you to take political control over a continent, as Technocracy's did. As for leverage points, well, I'm skeptical; studying root causes might turn up such options, yes, but can it make them happen in the teeth of the entrenched resistance of everyone who benefits from the status quo? I have my doubts. <br><br>Peter, thanks for the link; I'll check it out. I can always be reached by an email sent to info (at) aoda (dot) org. <br><br>GreenStrong, I don't think it's at all fair to the great diversity of individuals and groups working along these lines to claim that permaculture is "the" movement doing systems theory and appropriate tech. It's one of the movements; it has some very good things to offer, but it's not the be-all and end-all. <br><br>Mark, excellent! I read Fukuoka back in the early 1980s -- we had a copy of <i>The One Straw Revolution</i> at the Outback Farm, and put some work into adapting his methods for our ecosystem, with mixed results. More generally, though, Gore is very nearly a poster child for the kind of activism we don't need; I recall an article a while back that pointed out that George W. Bush's ranch in Texas has a much smaller carbon footprint than Gore's mansion.<br><br><a href=political-ecology-of-collapse.html#c5152761961743390692 title="comment permalink">12/17/09, 8:28 AM</a><br><br>

"Right/wrong" is a useful model to view the world through sometimes but it fails miserably in many, many cases, especially when people get positional about their points of view (c.f. most divorces and all wars). Not many people realize that right and wrong do not exist independently of language. Cheetahs do not have the concept right and wrong, nor do camels or any other species that does not have language.

I was part of the early anti-war and civil rights movement and then, in my 30s, moved on into all of what you describe. Suddenly, it ended. For the past 30 years, I have asked myself "Where is everybody?" The takeover of the means of communication - and the means of production - by corporate/state interests just disappeared the alternative movements and their technologies. I love the way you describe it - the system was fighting back. Of course it was! For the past 30 or so years, I supposed that most of my contemporaries had gotten conservative and apolitical but it was hard to believe that all of that energy was just - gone. The Internet, of course, has now made it clear that we are still out there, but we are old now and we have wasted 30 years!

I will only bother so much.<br><br>Taking modern political displays or apparent inaptness of governments and “leftish” intellectuals at face value increasingly looks like a precarious delusion to me. My point should be clear: we are dealing not so much with an <i>established homeostatic</i> social-political system, but with an escalating and very unconservative process. <br><br>There is so much talk these days about failed movements, failed states, failed ideologies. How often did you hear about <i>failed states</i> just 10 years ago? I live in a city where a couple of international Expo exhibitions were held in 1970s and perhaps 1990, in two different parks. Just last weekend I went to the park with the 1990 pavilions, many still reasonably preserved. It was quite ironic to walk around ethnic and modern art designs, UN peace symbolism, boards with state names. Many of those Arabian, African or East Asian countries are tirelessly mentioned as failed states nowadays. Then there is a slope for Yugoslavia, but next to it is already Russian Federation, not Soviet Union. The Bulgarian ground looks no less imposing than neighboring France and Austria. I indeed remember, East Europeans were much more proud of themselves then than now. I don’t know how modern Expo exhibitions look, but that park feels like a gone world. Was it a more naive world? Or just more egalitarian, optimistic, and less manipulated?<br><br>Particularly often you <a href="http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15065405" rel=nofollow>can come</a> across articles on <a href=http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200911u/berlin-wall rel=nofollow>European doom</a> or decline. People just talk about dooms that they find convenient to talk about!<br><br>I would have more patience in saying what ideas or processes failed. How did the neoconservative movement failed when Bill Cristoll, Krauthammer, Bolton and other neocons are still regularly asked their opinion, however often they might had been wrong before? When was the last time you saw a system theorist on TV? Or were they ever so ubiquitous as Glenn Becks and Billy O’Reillys? The system theory and green movements of the 1970s failed only in that much that they did not keep their (rather modest) status under the aggressive change of political climate.<br><br><a href=political-ecology-of-collapse.html#c2893133499010149682 title="comment permalink">12/17/09, 6:44 PM</a><br><br>

I have generally found that Permaculture as it is currently manifest is heavy on jargon, elaborate schemes, meetings, breakout groups, and small-scale demonstration installations, and light on most everything else. Our town has become a hotbed now of "Financial Permaculture," which as far as I can tell consists of jargon layered on top of jargon to the point that I have yet to decipher what their actual goals and philosophies are. <br><br>When I was a systems ecologist there was a version of an old joke going around...

Your point -- that small localized actions are our most powerful option -- seems right on target to me.<br><br>Pangolin, you've basically stated the theme of a post I intend to write sometime soon: the desperate need for models of transformation that can bootstrap themselves. More on this later. <br><br>Duncan, I'll have to read George -- haven't gotten around to him yet. <br><br>Tristan, depends on what kind of reading you want to do. On systems theory? Or on the history of the systems movement? <br><br>Vera, my point exactly -- the conversations we need to have can be had with or without boatloads of technology. <br><br>Aangel, ancient Athens and Elizabethan London didn't have lots of cheap energy, either, and -- to return to my earlier point -- they had plenty of new conversations. I disagree with your basic claim that new conversations are in any way a monopoly of modernity, or even fostered by it. I know that's a common claim these days, but I would argue that it's a product of the same mythology of progress that's helped land us in our present predicament. <br><br>Walter, I didn't say that the Illuminati were a tired subject, only that some of the current fantasies about them are not of interest to me. Still, I don't claim to please all the people all the time, you know. <br><br>Lynn, anything you've got from the appropriate tech movement, from personal experiences to unpublished documents, is a major resource right now, and there are people who are interested in putting it to use. Please consider looking around online, seeing who's doing the sort of thing you used to do, and offering your help -- there's plenty to be done. <br><br>Richard, the crucial thing you need to do -- and I say this from personal experience -- is make yourself part of the community. Join the Grange or some other local community organization, cultivate connections with your neighbors, become "those nice kids who live down the lane -- yeah, they're a bit strange, but they've always been polite and helpful." That's the key to living outside the liberal middle class ghetto. <br><br>Das Monde, so? You have the right to disagree with my views, just as I certainly exercise the right to disagree with yours. The change in political climate had causes other than the alleged malevolence of the people you don't like, and it seems tolerably clear to me that some of those causes were missteps on the side you support. If that's not a perspective you find useful, well, as I mentioned to Walter, I don't claim to please all the people all the time.<br><br><a href=political-ecology-of-collapse.html#c8687890358057312419 title="comment permalink">12/17/09, 7:15 PM</a><br><br>

The differences are complex, partly rooted in the historical situation of the time, and partly in the pragmatic and ruthless attitude toward power on the part of the Nazi leadership.

For those of you partisans who object to casting both Obama and Reagan in the same terms, consider for a moment how little difference there is between their actual policies. Reagan would have been against adding to the national health plan, of course, and Obama would have been easier on the environmentalists, but otherwise, they differ remarkably little on policy.<br><br>The consensus government in the US is Establishment Liberalism, and to climb the ladder to power, you must embrace, and be embraced by the opinion makers that enforce that consensus. So one side says we should immediately invade Iran, and one side says we must impose sanctions and save military action for later. Neither side asks what particular justification we have in the goings-on in a sovereign nation half a world away. <br><br>One side is pro-torture, one is decent enough to want to hide the torture. Neither side says that we should not torture. Social issues, like abortion and gay marriage are cynically used by the partisans to drum up support from people who care about them, and then carefully ignored until the next election. Any attempt to make a real change brings out the entrenched interests with their long sharp knives and bags full of cash. The attempted reform, like the so-called health care bill, quickly becomes a tool of the powerful in the current system to further embed themselves and to exclude any real change. <br><br>National Health Care becomes insurance reform. Tort reform becomes a make-work program for lawyers. Banking reform becomes a system for the banks to extract money from the taxpayer. Bankruptcy reform becomes the exclusion of the middle class from bankruptcy protection. Campaign finance reform becomes a gag order for any who would criticize incumbents. Patent reform becomes an open invitation to corporations to lock up more and more obvious ideas under government-enforced monopoly. Copyright reform becomes an open season for the parasites of the recording and movie industries to lock up our culture behind DRM firewalls and tollbooths. And the beat goes on.<br><br>Meanwhile sincere and dedicated partisans of both the right and the left watch bewildered as their champions, who they worked so had to put into positions of influence, betray them. It happens again and again. <br><br>Sometimes a Bernie Saunders or a Ron Paul makes it through the filters, but they are marginalized and quarantined. If they start to generate some influence, they and their supporters are ridiculed and maligned, Racists on the Right, Communists on the Left.

Hitler was a government agent planted by the secret police to keep a tap on the possible issue at hand. At the time there were many revolutionary ideas and even coup attempts in Germany. Russia had after all fallen due to the same war. The secret services and the army were worried of revolution, perhaps even more so than the Weimer Republic. Hitler rose to power and the old guard of the former regime were still a powerful system standing along side the imported liberal government. They sympathized with much of what Hitler said, even to an extent with the racial elements. They never crushed him in his infancy. His climb was exponential towards the end of the 1920s. Too late. <br><br>Perhaps the Nazi Party was a failed attempt to gain political power through a proxy political party controlled by a much larger system. The old guard might have wanted a say in a new liberal political system. A more modern example could be the way the Kreml creates its own parties or in fact allies itself with many of its parliamentary enemies.<br><br><a href=political-ecology-of-collapse.html#c7550488283428754539 title="comment permalink">12/19/09, 6:56 PM</a><br><br>
