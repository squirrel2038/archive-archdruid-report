One of the more interesting aspects of writing these essays is that I can never predict in advance what will get me a flurry of outraged responses each week. It’s a fair bet that something always does; the collective conversation of the modern industrial world has become so overheated in the last decade or so that it’s difficult to say much of anything without getting somebody in a swivet; still, what it is that sets off the swiveteers routinely catches me by surprise.<br><br>Last week was no exception. Of all the things in that essay that might plausibly have launched the usual cries of outrage, the one that did so was an offhand reference to the free market fundamentalists of the Austrian school, many of whom insist that the proper solution to every economic problem is to let the market have its way. As it happens, in making that comment I was thinking specifically of Michael Shedlock aka Mish, whose<a href=http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/ > blog </a>is one of the handful I read daily. <br><br>Mish is among the most thoughtful and articulate proponents of the Austrian school in today's blogosphere, and he has an excellent eye for the economic news that matters – which is by and large exactly the economic news that the rest of the media avoids covering. Very nearly the only thing on his blog that makes me roll my eyes is his repeated insistence that the market is always right and government regulation is always wrong; no matter how berserk the market gets, its vagaries are for the best, and any problems should be corrected by privatizing even more government functions. Now of course Mish is hardly an official spokesperson for the Austrian school, as if there were such a thing, but he's not exactly alone in his insistence, either.<br><br>Enough people in the peak oil scene share similar views that it's probably necessary to say something about the free market and its potential for solving or creating problems during the twilight years of industrialism ahead of us. Any such comments need to be prefaced, though, by a reminder that a spectrum consists of something other than its two endpoints. Just as a great many people on the left have picked up the dubious habit of using labels such as "fascism" for any political system to the right of Hillary Clinton, a great many people on the right seem to have convinced themselves that any form of economic regulation at all is tantamount to some sort of neo-Marxist hobgoblin – a "socialist-communist-ecologist" system, to use a phrase that actually appeared in one of the comments fielded by last week's post.<br><br>Now it bears remembering that drowning is not the only alternative to dying of dehydration; there's a middle ground that is noticeably more pleasant than either. The same principle also applies in economics. The experiment of having government own all the means of production in an industrial society, along the lines proposed by Marx, received a thorough test at the hands of the Communist bloc and failed abjectly. At the same time, the experiment of having government keep its hands off the economy altogether in an industrial society, along the lines proposed by a great many free-market proponents these days, received an equally thorough test, and failed just as dismally. The test took place a little earlier; in America, it ran from the end of the Civil War into the first decade of the twentieth century, and the result was a catastrophic sequence of booms and busts, the transfer of most of the nation's wealth to a tiny minority of wealthy people, the bitter impoverishment of nearly everyone else, and a level of social unrest that included two presidential assassinations and so many bomb attacks on the rich and their families that bomb-throwing anarchists became a regular theme of music-hall songs.<br><br>Now it's always possible for theorists to contrast a Utopian portrait of a free-market economy against the gritty and unwelcome realities of extreme socialism, just as it's possible for people on the other side of the spectrum to contrast a Utopian portrait of a socialist economy against the equally gritty and unwelcome realities of unfettered capitalism. Both make great rhetorical strategies, since the human mind is easily misled by binary logic: if A is evil, it seems wholly reasonable to claim that the opposite of A must be good. The real world does not work that way, but this is hardly the only case in which rhetoric ignores reality. <br><br>The problem with the rhetoric, however, may be stated a bit more precisely: however pleasant they look on paper, free markets do not exist. Strictly speaking, they are as mythical as hippogriffs.<br><br>It occurs to me that some of my readers may not be as familiar with hippogriffs as they ought to be. (Tut, tut – what <i>do</i> they teach children these days?) For those who lack so basic an element in their education, a hippogriff is the offspring of a gryphon and a mare; it has the head, body, hind legs, and tail of a horse, and the forelimbs and wings of a giant eagle. Hippogriffs are said to be the strongest and swiftest of all flying creatures, which is why Astolpho rode one to the terrestrial paradise to recover Orlando's lost wits in <i>Orlando Furioso</i>, and why Juss rode one to the summit of Koshtra Pivrarcha to rescue Goldry Bluszco in <i>The Worm Ouroboros</i>. They are splendid creatures, no question; their only disadvantage, really, is the minor point that they don't happen to exist, and drawing up plans to use them as a new, energy-efficient means of air transport in the face of peak oil, for instance, will inevitably come to grief on that annoying little detail.<br><br>Free markets are subject to essentially the same little problem. There have been many examples of market economies in history that were not controlled by governments, but there have been no examples of market economies that were not controlled, and if one were to be set up, it would remain a free market for maybe a week at most. Adam Smith explained why in memorable language in <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>: "People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or some contrivance to raise prices." When a market is not controlled by government edicts, religious taboos, social customs, or some other outside force, it will quickly be controlled by combinations of individuals whose wealth and strategic position in the market enable them to maximize the economic benefits accruing to them, by squeezing out rivals, manipulating prices, buying up their suppliers, bribing government officials, and the like: that is to say, behaving the way capitalists behave whenever they are left to their own devices. This is what created the profoundly dysfunctional economy of Gilded Age America, and it also played a very large role in setting up the current debacle.<br><br>There's a rich irony here, in that the market economy portrayed in textbooks – in which buyers and sellers are numerous and independent enough that free competition regulates their interactions – is exactly the sort of commons that so many free market proponents insist should be eliminated wholesale in favor of private ownership. All commons systems, as Garrett Hardin pointed out in a famous essay a while back, are hideously vulnerable to abuse unless they are managed in ways that prevent individuals from exploiting the commons for their own private benefit. This year's Nobel laureate in economics, Elinor Ostrom, won her award for demonstrating that it's entirely possible to manage a commons so that Hardin's "tragedy of the commons" does not happen, and she's quite right – there have been many examples of successfully managed commons in history. Strip away the management that keeps it from being abused, however, and the free market, like any other commons, rapidly destroys itself.<br><br>This does not mean that the best, or for that matter the only, alternative to the unchecked rule of corporate robber barons is Marxist-style state ownership of the economy; once again, dying from heatstroke is not the only alternative to dying from hypothermia. It means, rather, that something between these two extremes might be worth trying, especially if it can be shown by historical evidence to work tolerably well in practice. Of course this is what history shows; broadly speaking, economies that leave the means of production in private hands, but use appropriate regulation to harness their energies to the public good, consistently produce more prosperity for more people than either unfettered capitalism or extreme socialism.<br><br>This being said, the midpoint between these extremes may not lie where today's conventional wisdom tends to place it. Consider an example from the not too distant past: a large industrial nation with a capitalist economy, but remarkably tough regulations restricting the growth of private fortunes and the abuses to which capitalist economies are so often prone. The wealthiest people in that nation paid more than two-thirds of their annual income in tax, and monopolistic practices on the part of corporations faced harsh and frequently applied judicial penalties. The financial sector was particularly tightly leashed: interest rates on savings were fixed by the government, usury laws put very low caps on the upper end of interest rates for loans, and hard legal barriers prevented banks from expanding out of local markets or crossing the firewall between consumer banking and the riskier world of corporate investment. Consumer credit was difficult enough to get, as a result, that most people did without it most of the time, using layaway plans and Christmas Club savings programs to afford large purchases.<br><br>According to the standard rhetoric of free market proponents these days, so rigidly controlled an economy ought by definition to be hopelessly stagnant and unproductive. This shows the separation of rhetoric from reality, however, for the nation I have just described was the United States during the presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower: that is, during one of the most sustained periods of prosperity, innovation, economic development and international influence this nation has ever seen. Now of course there were other factors behind America's 1950s success, just as there were other factors behind the decline since then; still, it's worth noting that as the economic regulations of the 1950s have been dismantled – in every case, under the pretext of boosting American prosperity – the prosperity of most Americans has gone down, not up.<br><br>It makes a good measure of how far we have come as a nation – and not in a useful direction – that the economic policies of one of the most successful 20th century Republican administrations would be rejected by most of today's Democrats as too far to the left. A case could be made, in fact, that far and away the most sensible thing the US Congress could do today, in the face of an economy that has very nearly choked to death on its own bubbles, is to reenact the economic legislation in place in the 1950s, line for line. (When you're hiking in the woods, and discover that you've taken a trail that leads someplace you don't want to go, your best bet is normally to turn around and go back to the last place where you were still going in the right direction.)<br><br>Yet there's an interesting point that also ought to be made about the economic regulation of the 1950s. Outside of antitrust legislation, not that much of it applied to the economy of goods and services on any level, whether that of Mom and Pop grocery stores or big industrial conglomerates. The bulk of it, and very nearly all the strictest elements of it, focused on the financial industry. More broadly speaking, instead of regulating the production and consumption of goods and services, the economic policies of the Eisenhower era focused on regulating money: on ensuring that too much of it did not end up concentrated unproductively in too few hands, and on controlling its propensity to multiply as enthusiastically as rabbits on Viagra. The relative success of these measures points toward a distinction already made in these posts, and to practical steps that will be explored in next week's post.

Austrians understand exactly how the manipulation of credit markets exacerbates the natural cycles of the market. <br><br>Unfortunately they have no sense of politics or history at all. The Austrian approach to recession, best summarized as "let it burn" really is the best, fastest and most effective way to clear the markets and return to a more prosperous economy. <br><br>Essentially the Austrians teach that recessions are the market's way to equalizing the disparity between increases in productivity and debt. Debt always increases more than productivity, at an exponential rate (historically a 3% growth rate will typically yield a 5% interest rate). Since that disparity results over time in a parabolic curve, in which total debt becomes infinite, the gap must periodically be reset. The mechanism is Western economies to do so is bankruptcy. <br><br>By protecting our largest financial institutions from bankruptcy, we are essentially forcing the debt level further up the parabola. This ensures that when the unsustainable debt levels are no longer sustained, the amount of wealth wiped out will not simply bankrupt a single company, or a single industry, but the entire country. <br><br>That's how we get to 8, soon to be 12 trillion dollars of public funds pumped into the financial system and the upcoming choice between a currency collapse and hyperinflation.<br><br>Outside of Misesean analysis of the business cycle though, Austrian economics is largely rehashed "classical liberalism". We all know how well that worked for the common people during the Industrial Revolution.<br><br><a href=harnessing-hippogriffs.html#c8285286038236524089 title="comment permalink">11/4/09, 11:07 PM</a><br><br>

As I've listened to the free market advocates recently, I sense a parallel with religious meta-narratives that envision a future reality of eternal bliss once we humans shed our ...well, our human nature. The fact that we've evolved over millions of years and will probably not change in the foreseeable future (just as corruption will not miraculously disappear in some government-less economy) doesn't stop proponents of Utopia from trying to construct a Hippogriff. In most societies, the Austrian school's failure to acknowledge reality would be considered a form of psychosis.

Take away any rules - or any rule enforcement - and price collusion is the least of your worries. The most basic trouble is smash and grab, or maybe the thugs just kill the trader to be able to sort through the stock in a more leisurely fashion. Extortion is then a slightly more civilized use of violence than robbery. After those come all sorts of fraud. Actually, without any rules, there can't be fraud.

Still, you won't do much better on the internet, which is arguably the single worst place to do historical reading. The technology you need is called a public library; you can find any number of good histories of the period there. <br><br>Palmer, the one-sided description of government you've presented here is just as unbalanced as the one-sided liberal view that more government is the solution to all problems. Government is a tool, and it can be used skillfully or clumsily. <br><br>Tinfoil, no argument there. I think that horse was converted to puree by the time Rand got done with it. <br><br>Xhmko, and yet Lee was basically unable to transmit what he could do to anyone else; his achievements rose on the foundation of the very "classical mess" he thought he was rejecting. It's the same problem of thinking that the opposite of a bad thing must be a good thing; as Aristotle pointed out a long time ago, the opposite of one bad thing is usually another bad thing, and the good thing is in the middle ground between them. <br><br>Patz, of course a saner economic policy won't solve peak oil. It could, however, prevent a whole mess of additional trouble from being heaped on top of peak oil -- which is what current economic ideas, and policies based on them, are busy doing. <br><br>Vic, I mentioned in my post that there was more going on than good economic policies. My point is simply that in a crisis, good policies are likely to be more useful than bad ones. <br><br>Danby, no argument there. If they'd pry their very thoughtful analysis of money and the business cycle free from the free market ideology that encrusts them, the result would be more useful.<br><br><a href=harnessing-hippogriffs.html#c2222416940352690676 title="comment permalink">11/5/09, 7:18 AM</a><br><br>

Still, you're right that Ostrom's work is extremely valuable; notice how many of her principles are present in American constitutional government, for example, and how many of them are absent from the allegedly more liberating systems proposed to replace it. <br><br>Peter, holy crap. I knew they were arrogant idiots, but this pretty much takes the cake. It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for whom to enter the kingdom of heaven? <br><br>Andy, no, there's the right number of nots. You could also phrase the second half of the sentence as "every market has been controlled." <br><br>Rick, most people are very glad to hear somebody tell them what they want to hear, no matter how big the gap between what they want to hear and the reality that's staring them in the face. <br><br>Gaia's Daughter, I'm a great fan of hippogriffs, though not much of a fan of Harry Potter, and even less of a fan of rehashes of 18th century deism disguised as economic theory. No argument there. <br><br>Yaacov, hmm. Glancing back over my previous writing, I find plenty of over-the-top metaphors and no shortage of attitude. Is it possible that more of the recent imagery and attitude have been aimed at your views than before? <br><br>Jim, an excellent point! Of course there are rules; the question is who sets and enforces them. Even an unregulated market, as you point out, depends utterly on the state to enforce laws protecting property. <br><br>Gerontion, from my perspective, Marx combined a very thoughtful critique of the capitalism of his time with a hopelessly unworkable Utopian scheme for replacing it. I don't think it's accidental that wherever strict Marxian socialism has been put into place, with total government ownership of the means of production, the results have been not too different from those in the Soviet Union, just as the results of completely unrestricted capitalism tend to approximate closely to the mess that was America's Gilded Age -- of which Pinochet's Chile was a later and more malevolent copy. I think Marx made some good points, and I'll be discussing him later on in these posts, but the Russian joke is apposite: "Everything Marx said about Communism was wrong, but everything he said about capitalism was right." <br><br>DIYer, no, restoring the regulations of the 50s won't bring back the prosperity of that decade, but it might just stave off the kind of abject economic collapse toward which current economic policies are pushing the US, and it might also prevent a great deal of unnecessary human misery. At this point, for reasons of fossil fuel depletion as much as anything else, the age of abundance is ending -- but that doesn't make mitigation impossible, or inappropriate.<br><br><a href=harnessing-hippogriffs.html#c3952539626134205972 title="comment permalink">11/5/09, 7:46 AM</a><br><br>

The laws protecting property are exactly the laws that regulate the market. No market regulation = no lawful property.

But the faculty of care was in excess of need, and all that overflowed, and would otherwise run to waste, ought to be gently turned in the direction of one's neighbor, seeing that this also wrought for the fulfilling of the law, inasmuch as the reaction of excess so directed was upon the director of the same, to the comfort, that is, and wellbeing of the original self.

I quite like your metaphors, so I'll add on a dollop, reaching back to Crete and their mythological creatures: Broadly in agreement with what you say about the Austrian School, could we not use the the image of the Minotaur here? Whatever bearishness or bullishness may be the flavor of the day concerning a given stock, it seems to be all BULL when it comes to market miracle-making.<br><br>But, however rich the 'bestiaires imaginaires' of our culture may be, the main take-away from this article for me concerns the difficulty societies have in trying times to reset the dial 'somewhere towards the middle.' Once the abuses which inevitably accompany excessive concentration of wealth and power in a society attain flagrant, massive, in-your-face heights, when the reaction comes it's liable to be a pendulum swing.<br><br>This is to say that, rather than digging into that society's "system recovery toolkit," the propensity might be to throw it all out and cross all ten fingers. "Yeah, right, let's just dump capitalism, what did it ever do for me?" That's where you're on the mark looking back to the 50s (60s and 70s still qualify too, to some extent in my book). <br><br>A final word on another of your metaphors: the tight leash on certain financial behaviors. The problem that anyone who tries to restore that will have, of course, is that the one who used to be standing upright and holding the loop is now the one on all fours with the collar around his neck.<br><br><a href=harnessing-hippogriffs.html#c7174819621623978652 title="comment permalink">11/5/09, 10:36 AM</a><br><br>

And it's good to hear from anybody who can refer to the Nicomachean Ethics these days. <br><br>Darius, the fact that Austrians fetishize the market rather than GDP is not much of an improvement. The Mitch Kapor comment, though, is dead on -- what makes anarchy different from other systems is not that there's no power hierarchy; it's that the power hierarchy, being covert, has no checks or balances at all. The same is true of groups that use consensus and the like. <br><br>Ana's Daughter, I'd forgotten that bit of MacDonald. Nice. <br><br>Gav, there's certainly call for toreadors in today's economic world, and you're quite right that a pendulum swing to the other extreme is all too likely. I wish free market fundamentalists would realize that it was precisely the extreme human cost of unchecked capitalism in the 19th and early 20th centuries that gave Marxism its opportunity. If they want a repeat, they're going about it the right way. <br><br>David, you're quite right. Since these are 2000-odd word essays rather than full-length books, that wasn't a point I addressed here, but of course it's crucial. <br><br>Danby, the only reason I use the polarity between socialism and capitalism is that that's where most of the action is these days. Of course there's a dizzying array of other possibilities, and it's nice to see the steelworkers exploring one of them. <br><br>Mark, no argument there. <br><br>Jacques, thank you!<br><br>Patz, it's always interested me that the number of quibbles about my prose goes up whenever I post something criticizing a popular belief system. <br><br>Palmer, the cynical insistence that every political system is always corrupt, and every political leader is simply pursuing personal power, is as unproductive as any other kind of blanket assumption. I gather that you'd reject the claim that every capitalist is a ruthless oppressor who cackles at the thought of trampling the poor; why do you insist on an equally caricatured image of people in politics? <br><br>Raymond, I suppose there's some entertainment value in debating Randroids, but I can't say it's high on my list of interests.

For the most part I agree with your analysis but I have to add my 2 cents. <br><br>Let me set the record straight regarding regulations in today's economy. Most regulation is set up to keep monopolies in place not break them up. Most regulation comes from lobbyists and special interest groups. What usually happens is that the regulation ends up barring entry into whatever business is being regulated, or it allows loopholes for big business. Ron Paul explains it here: http://www.ronpaul.com/2008-11-10/ron-paul-why-more-regulation-makes-things-worse/.

I enjoy reading Mish's blog also but he certainly doesn't represent the Austrian School (which you alluded to).<br><br>I am still not convinced that we need to have a hybrid socialist/capitalist market. Here is my solution: <br><br>1. Eliminate the Federal Reserve. <br><br>2. Let the Big Investment Banks go bankrupt which is what would happen without the Federal Reserve giving them cheap credit. They would be shown to be essentially insolvent anyway if their books were kept according to rigorous accounting standards.<br><br>3. Set up a State Bank in each State modeled after the State Bank of North Dakota. Ellen Brown has written about this here: http://www.webofdebt.com/articles/cut-wallstreet.php. <br><br>4. Don't allow the National Government to run deficits. This would eliminate the expansion of the American Empire.<br><br>To put it in other words: We need to gut our current corrupt monetary system and install a Credit system. The monetary system that is run by central bankers is the root cause of economic/financial hardship for people.<br><br>OK, I admit, these measures are about as achievable as finding a Hippogriph but IMO this type of set up would allow Free Markets to prosper without the need for regulations.<br><br>I will leave you with this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KnGNOiFll4.

As people get poorer they wont become more self reliant they will become more reliant on imported goods which will be even more competitive meaning more businesses moving offshore meaning more people, rinse and repeat. More poor people meaning more reliance on the government and reduced taxes. It seems the process we will go through is literally eating us alive.<br><br>I give an example, a local farmer I know on the urban fringe with excellent land and water can barely make a return on their property and will eventually sell meaning more houses will be built. So we may want local produce in an energy constrained world but current conditions demand that anything we destroy anything which could deliver on it. <br><br>In order to avoid complete collapse how do we stem the tide ie rebuild localised economies given the structure of the economy now so that not everything we have is abandoned like the ruins of Petra or Lepcis Magna?<br><br><a href=harnessing-hippogriffs.html#c5599323046321312498 title="comment permalink">11/6/09, 12:54 AM</a><br><br>

But it is sad to notice reflection of a revisionist projection regarding “fascism” calling. (What particularly bothered recently?)<br><br>The formulation that “really” free markets are non-existent is not very instructive either. It allows for pushing for yet more “freer markets” and therefore yet deeper ideological and economic marasmus. Even communists did not insist that much that the particular history of their revolutions is little representative of their ideals, or that their power balance could have been much better. Beware of any ideological requirements of perfection, on any side.<br><br>The problem of identifying “free markets” is that one man’s freedom could be another man’s serfdom. When you look carefully what is really done in the name of freedom, you notice that it is the freedom to capture or grab as much wealth as possible that is religiously protected and strived for. Collection of property or privilege rents (however ridiculous) is an important freedom, while freedom from monetary constraints or bad fortunes is not important. The actually promoted freedom ideal is not much different from feudal freedom, or even slaveholder’s freedom. If money is the ultimate freedom, lack of money or debt must be slavery.<br><br>One freedom worth attention is freedom to cooperate. It is striking, when you give a thought, how much resources for cooperation the powerful and other beau monde have and utilize, compared to utter lack of cooperative drive between have-nots. I made a comment to the previous essay that ideologically accepted theories affect our understanding of the world (and myths about it) as profoundly as language. Ever since classical economy and Darwinian evolution were vulgarized to the view of cutthroat competition, the theoretical “impossibility” of cooperation became a tool to deprive the have-nots to find better life anywhere else but in selling out to multinational and financial powers. One insight of the cited Nobel SBMP laureate Elinor Ostrom is that the <i>tragedy of commons</i> perils are more dreadful in theory than in practice. Various human societies did manage to preserve their common good for long periods, with different levels of organization and individual concern. Similar observations are gaining acknowledgement in the evolution and ecology theories as well. One thing that will lighten up the global collapse is that people will allow more freely benefits of close and immediate cooperation to themselves, not only to the “best of the best”.<br><br><a href=harnessing-hippogriffs.html#c1712337806842425968 title="comment permalink">11/9/09, 1:29 AM</a><br><br>

The security situation there has a lot to do with the failings of the current regime.<br><br>Returning from SA, I had a much greater appreciation for the relative safety of life in the US than I'd had previously. Some of that is the lingering after-effects of centuries of colonialism and decades of apartheid, but then some also is from recent neo-liberal policies that place the welfare of corporations above that of average citizens.<br><br>On the subject of gov't corruption, though... I work in local gov't, as a planner, and have applied for two separate ARRA grants (the US stimulus bill), and can testify to the freakshow that is my state's handling of that money. A friend, working for the state, told me "they can't burn that money fast enough," and "I've been told to take all grant applications at face value... I'm not allowed to check any of the information I'm given... I really doubt that that many jobs are being created."<br><br><a href=harnessing-hippogriffs.html#c3841108137068886896 title="comment permalink">11/9/09, 5:26 AM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c3817902441911186611></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/18006145704406196304 rel=nofollow>Kevin</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Personally I'm not quite so dismissive of anarchist thinking as seems to be the case with most here. I wouldn't toss out the window the ideas of writers like Peter Kropotkin or J.H. Mackay, or even Stirner. Over a hundred years ago anarchist activists like Emma Goldman and Mikhail Bakunin were very serious about changing the world for what they saw as the better, often exhibiting great courage in that pursuit, and I have a certain respect for them. Anarchists played a significant role during Catalonia's regrettably brief republican period in 1936, as observed by George Orwell, who was most impressed by what he witnessed there. I gather anarchism was also an important component in the thinking of the Wobblies, who were very active in the United States until government and corporate goons effectively crushed their movement in 1919. <br><br>That said, it must be acknowledged that modern anarchists do seem to exhibit the traits you attribute to them. Their formerly vital movement has devolved into ideological squabbling which chiefly consists of claiming to be more-anarchist-than-thou, and of uncredibly claiming to have no ideology. Some seem to use it as a cloak for their authoritarian tendencies or personality structures. The worst I've seen are certain punker skinhead types who are basically just looking for excuses to beat up anyone they don't like, and figure that'll be easier if there aren't any cops or other civil authorities around to prevent them from doing that. <br><br>I've noticed that when leftists and right wingers criticize one another, they're generally right on. Marxists and capitalists do indeed possess the faults which each group attributes to the other, and each group is characteristically blind to its own flaws, each thus casting an unflattering but revealing light upon the other. In a somewhat similar sense, I think anarchism can be useful with respect to government. Anarchists may often be obnoxious and hopelessly impractical, but when they say that government has an innate tendency to expand its authority beyond its proper bounds, they're right. When they say that it typically ends up serving vested (usually moneyed) interests, this is no more than the truth. When they point out that bureaucracies generally become bloated self-serving fiefdoms of petty and not-so-petty tyranny, they're telling no lies. Authority unjustifiably takes for granted its presumptive right to exert power over public and individual. Even from the viewpoint of Jeffersonian democracy - that bourgeois democracy which anarchists profess to despise - I think it useful to have around some people who are militantly quick to point out that there is no innately legitimate authority, and that it exists on sufferance of the people only. <br><br>One model anarchist writers seem to be fond of is that of the voluntary association, examples of which are groups like the Freemasons, the Odd Fellows, the Boy Scouts, quilting bees, and even a good dinner party, all of which strike me as unobjectionable. If their ideas were of no value, I don't think that a smart writer like Ursula LeGuin would have put anarchist anti-propertarianism at the heart of one of her best novels, <i><b>The Dispossessed</b></i>. The human mind should be unafraid to push to the utmost boundaries of what is conceivable, and anarchy performs this function with respect to thinking about liberty.<br><br><a href=harnessing-hippogriffs.html#c3817902441911186611 title="comment permalink">11/9/09, 11:23 AM</a><br><br>

Another of those terms whose meaning changes with the times ...<br><br>I share your circumspection concerning today's manifestations of the phenomenon. But if you're interested I might provide a source or two worth pursuing from the 'core' movement: Voline and his remarkable history of Ukrainian anarchist Nestor Makhno in "La révolution inconnue" (English title, supposing it's been translated, might be: The Unknown Revolution. Alexander Skirda has something to say there too and Ida Mett is also worth a mention on Makhno as well as Cronstadt, as I suppose you know. To close, I'll speak of the French geographer-anarchist Elysée Reclus whose definition of was ""L'anarchie, c'est la plus haute expression de l'ordre." (My translation - Anarchy is the highest expression of order). This 'order, I believe, in their view, was meant to trickle UP, not trickle down.

A modern equivalent would be if Microsoft, Intel, IBM, Apple, and the top dozen internet service providers were all the same company. <br><br>Das Monde, it amazes me that I can say something in so many words and have it interpreted in very nearly the opposite sense. Saying that free markets do not exist doesn't justify trying to make them "more free," any more than saying that perpetual motion doesn't exist is an argument for investing money in perpetual motion machines. Rather, the fact that free markets are as imaginary as hippogriffs means that, since all markets are controlled, we need to talk about what kind of controls on markets are beneficial and what kind are less so. As for the freedom to cooperate, I support this, as long as it's paired with the freedom not to do so. <br><br>Tony, I've been hearing much the same thing about the stimulus bill. The plan seems to be to flood the economy with money, not to do it in any useful or honest way. <br><br>Kevin, voluntary organizations such as the Masons and Odd Fellows are able to exist and function as they do because of the wider protection provided by government. The Masons, Odd Fellows, and other fraternal orders are quite aware of this; they thus include appropriate respect for the institutions of government among the values they expect to see in members and potential members alike. <br><br>Gav, well, all I can say is that in my experience, anarchism works only when there's a covert hierarchy behind the facade of equality, and not always even then. The historical record isn't too supportive, either.<br><br><a href=harnessing-hippogriffs.html#c1002607966323703640 title="comment permalink">11/10/09, 8:51 PM</a><br><br>

As you know from my previous comment, I'm a planner for local government, which is sort of... contradictory.
