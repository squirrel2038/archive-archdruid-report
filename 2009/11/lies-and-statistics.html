Plenty of difficulties stand in the way of making sense of the economic realities we face at the end of the age of cheap abundant energy. Some of those difficulties are inevitable, to be sure. Our methods of producing goods and services are orders of magnitude more complex than those of previous civilizations, for example, and our economy relies on treating borrowing as wealth to an extent no other society has been harebrained enough to try before; these and other differences make the task of tracing the economic dimensions of the long road of decline and fall ahead of us unavoidably more difficult than they otherwise would be.<br><br>Still, there are other sources of difficulty that are entirely voluntary, and I want to talk about some of those self-inflicted blind spots just now. An economy is a system for exchanging goods and services, with all the irreducible variability that this involves. How many potatoes are equal in value to one haircut, for example, depends a good deal on the fact that no two potatoes and no two haircuts are exactly the same, and no two people can be counted on to place quite the same value on either one. Economics, however, is mostly about numbers that measure, in abstract terms, the exchange of potatoes and haircuts (and everything else, of course). <br><br>Economists rely implicitly on the claim that those numbers have some meaningful relationship with what’s actually going on when potato farmers get their hair cut and hairdressers order potato salad for lunch. As with any abstraction, a lot gets lost in the process, and sometimes what gets left out proves to be important enough to render the abstraction hopelessly misleading. That risk is hardwired into any process of mathematical modeling, of course, but there are at least two factors that can make it much worse.<br><br>The first, of course, is that the numbers can be deliberately juggled to support some agenda that has nothing to do with accurate portrayal of the underlying reality. The second, subtler and even more misleading, is that the presuppositions underlying the model can shape the choice of what’s measured in ways that suppress what’s actually going on in the underlying reality. Combine these two and what you get might best be described as speculative fiction mislabeled as useful data – and the combination of these two is exactly what has happened to the statistics on which too many contemporary economic and political decisions are based.<br><br>I suspect most people are aware by now that there’s something seriously askew with the economic statistics cited by government officials and media pundits. Recent rhetoric about “green shoots of recovery” is a case in point. In recent months, I’ve checked in with friends across the US, and nobody seems to be seeing even the slightest suggestion of an upturn in their own businesses or regions. Quite the contrary; all the anecdotal evidence suggests that the Great Recession is tightening its grip on the country as autumn closes in.<br><br>There’s a reason for the gap between these reports and the statistics. For decades now, the US government has systematically tinkered with economic figures to make unemployment look lower, inflation milder, and the country more prosperous. The tinkerings in question are perhaps the most enthusiastically bipartisan program in recent memory, encouraged by administrations and congresspeople from both sides of the aisle, and for good reason; life is easier for politicians of every stripe if they can claim to have made the economy work better. As Bernard Gross predicted back in the 1970s, economic indicators have been turned into “economic vindicators” that subordinate information content to public relations gimmickry. These manipulations haven’t been particularly secret, either;visit <a href=http://www.shadowstats.com/ > www.shadowstats.com</a> and you can get the details, along with a nice set of statistics calculated the way the same numbers were done before massaging the figures turned into cosmetic surgery on a scale that would have made the late Michael Jackson gulp in disbelief.<br><br>These dubious habits have been duly pilloried in the blogosphere. Still, I'm not at all sure they are as misleading as the second set of distortions I want to discuss. When unemployment figures hold steady or sink modestly, but you and everyone you know are out of a job, it's at least obvious that something has gone haywire. Far more subtle, because less noticeable, are the biases that creep in because people are watching the wrong set of numbers entirely.<br><br>Consider the fuss made in economic circles about productivity. When productivity goes up, politicians and executives preen themselves; when it goes down, or even when it doesn't increase as fast as current theory says it ought, the cry goes up for more government largesse to get it rising again. Everyone wants the economy to be more productive, right? The devil, though, has his usual residence among the details, because the statistic used to measure productivity doesn't actually measure how productive the economy is.<br><br>Check out <i>A Concise Guide to Macroeconomics</i> by Harvard Business School professor David A. Moss: "The word [productivity] is commonly used as a shorthand for labor productivity, defined as output per worker hour (or, in some cases, as output per worker)." Output, here as always, is measured in dollars – usually, though not always, corrected for inflation – so what "productivity" means in practice is dollars of income per worker hour. Are there ways for a business to cut down on the employee hours per dollar of income without actually becoming more productive in any more meaningful sense? Of course, and most of them have been aggressively pursued in the hope of parading the magic number of a productivity increase before stockholders and the public.<br><br>Perhaps the simplest way to increase productivity along these lines is to change over from products that require high inputs of labor per dollar of value to those that require less. As a very rough generalization, manufacturing goods requires more labor input overall than providing services, and the biggest payoff per worker hour of all is in financial services – how much labor does it take, for example, to produce a credit swap with a theoretical value of ten million dollars? An economy that produces more credit swaps and fewer potatoes is in almost any real sense less productive, since the only value credit swaps have is that they can, under certain arbitrary conditions, be converted into funds that can buy concrete goods and services, such as potatoes; by the standards of productivity universal in the industrial world these days, however, replacing potato farmers with whatever you call the people who manufacture credit swaps (other than "bunco artists," that is) counts as an increase in productivity. I suspect this is one reason why the US auto industry got so heavily into finance in the run-up to the recent crash; GMAC's soaring productivity, measured in terms of criminally negligent loans per broker hour, probably did a lot to mask the anemic productivity gains available from the old-fashioned business of making cars.<br><br>As important as the misinformation generated by such arbitrary statistical constructs is the void that results because other, arguably more important figures are not being collected at all. In an age that will increasingly be constrained by energy limits, for example, a more useful measure of productivity might be energy productivity – that is, output per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) of energy consumed. An economy that produces more value with less energy input is arguably an economy better suited to the downslope of Hubbert's peak, and the relative position of different nations, to say nothing of the trendline of their energy productivity over time, would provide useful information to governments, investors, and the general public alike. For all I know, somebody already calculates this figure, but I'm still waiting to see a politician or an executive crowing over the fact that the country now produces 2% more output per unit of energy.<br><br>Now it's true that a simplistic measurement of energy productivity would still make the production of credit swaps look like a better deal. This is one of the many places where the distinction already made in these essays between primary, secondary, and tertiary economies becomes crucial. To recap, the primary economy is nature itself, or specifically the natural processes that provide the human economy with about 3/4 of its total value; the secondary economy is the application of human labor to the production of goods and services; and the tertiary economy is the exchange of abstract units of value, such as money and credit, which serve to regulate the distribution of the goods and services produced by the secondary economy.<br><br>The economic statistics used today ignore the primary economy completely, measure the secondary economy purely in terms of the tertiary – calculating production in dollars, say, rather than potatoes and haircuts – and focus obsessively on the tertiary. This fixation means that if an economic policy boosts the tertiary economy, it looks like a good thing, even if that policy does actual harm to the secondary or the primary economies, as it very often does these days. Thus the choice of statistics to track isn't a neutral factor, or a simple one; if it echoes inaccurate presuppositions – for example, the fantasy that the human economy is independent of nature – it can feed those presuppositions right back in as a distorting factor into every economic decision we make.<br><br>How might this be corrected? One useful option, it seems to me, is to divide up several of the most important economic statistics into primary, secondary, and tertiary factors. (Of course the first step is to get honest numbers in the first place; governments aren't going to do this any time soon, for obvious reasons, but there's no reason why people and organizations outside of government can't make a start.) Consider, as a good example, what might be done with the gross domestic product.<br><br>To start with, it's probably a good idea to consider going back to the gross national product; this was quietly dropped in favor of the current measure some years back, because it puts a politically uncomfortable spotlight on America's economic dependence on the rest of the world. Whichever way that decision goes, the statisticians of some imaginary Bureau of Honest Figures might sort things out something like this:<br><br><i>The gross primary product</i> or GPP might be the value of all unprocessed natural products at the moment they enter the economy – oil as it reaches the wellhead, coal as it leaves the mine, grain as it tumbles into the silo, and so on – minus all the costs incurred in drilling, mining, growing, and so on. (Those belong to the secondary economy.)<br><br><i>The gross secondary product</i> or GSP might be the value of all goods and services in the economy, except for raw materials from nature and financial goods and services.<br><br><i>The gross tertiary product</i> or GTP might be the value of all financial goods and services, and all money or money equivalents, produced by the economy.<br><br>The value of having these three separate numbers, instead of one gross domestic (or national) product, is that they can be compared to one another, and their shifts relative to one another can be tracked. If the GTP balloons and the other two products stay flat or decline, for example, that doesn't mean the country is getting wealthier; it means that the tertiary economy is inflating, and needs to have some air let out of it before it pops. If the GSP increases while the GPP stays flat, and the cost of extracting natural resources isn't soaring out of sight, then the economy is becoming more efficient at using natural resources, in which case the politicians and executives have good reason to preen themselves in public. Other relative shifts have other messages.<br><br>The point that has to be grasped, in this as in so many other contexts, is that the three economies, and the three kinds of wealth they produce, are not interchangeable. Trillions of dollars in credit swaps and derivatives will not keep people from starving in the streets if there's no food being grown and no housing being built, or maintained, or offered for sale or rent. The primary economy is fundamental to survival; the secondary economy is the source of real wealth; the tertiary economy is simply a way of measuring wealth and managing its distribution; and treating these three very different things as though they are one and the same makes rank economic folly almost impossible to avoid.<br><br>Now it deserves to be said that the chance that any such statistical scheme will be adopted in the United States under current political and social arrangements is effectively nonexistent. Far too many sacred cows would have to be put out to pasture or rounded up for slaughter first. Still, current political and social arrangements may turn out to be a good deal less permanent than they sometimes seem. What might replace them, here and elsewhere, is a topic I plan on exploring in a future essay here.

Let's take a brief detour into a mythical past, and bankster crimes that anyone can understand, as a metaphor for the frustration and anger which is building up:<br><br><b>It's A Wonderful Life - The Final Scene</b><br><br>Potter's personal health care attendant (the man who pushes his wheelchair) bursts into the party at George and Mary Bailey's house. The mood, which had been festive (we just saw the arrest warrant being torn apart and thrown on the pile of contributions from "so many friends") changes immediately, as the tale of Potter's purloining of the disappeared bank deposit is told. At first incredulous, the people become increasingly angry as the depth of depravity of the twisted, misanthropic millionaire becomes clear.<br><br>Next we see the crowd carrying torches as they approach Potter's mansion. It is the evil twin of the house that George, Mary, and their kids have filled with love, almost all in darkness, and without any sort of holiday decoration, neither Christmas tree, menorah, or solstice wreath. Ernie drives up in his cab, and siphons some gasoline from the tank. We see him and Potter's former health care attendant splashing it at the house entrances, including the wheelchair ramp. Uncle Billy ignites the flammable liquid by throwing his torch into it, and the rest of the crowd follows suit. The volunteer fire department arrives, but Burt the cop keeps them from coming up the long drive.<br><br>Through the windows we see Potter desperately going from room to room in his wheelchair, trying to escape, but it is useless. Uncle Billy watches with grim satisfaction, and as the flames of the house reflect in his glasses he mutters "So long, you old so and so."<br><br>We recognize other members of the crowd - the same men we saw in the "Pottersville bar" scene.<br><br>Clarence the angel, no longer in civilian clothes, but in his magnificent new robe and wings, watches sadly from treetop level. The camera pulls back and we see the house collapsing as the flames leap higher. The final scene pans upward from the burning house to the starry sky, and we see in Gothic letters the following Biblical quote: <b>"I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life" </b>(Deut. 30:19).<br><br><br>---------<br><br><br>Returning to our situation here in the 21st century - will there be a mass uprising, analogous to the spontaneous eruption of the people's justice in the preceding never-filmed scene? Not so likely, I guess, but not nearly as unlikely as it seems from inside the Beltway and on Wall Street. <br><br>Let me be clear - I don't want the banksters to be literally incinerated. I would be quite willing for their structures of oppression to be dismantled, however. One could find ways of doing so that could be described in JudeoChristian language with appropriate citations from Scripture. <br><br>Even just giving them fair trials, applying the laws that are already on the books (as was done during the Savings and Loan scandal of the late 20th century), would be a major change of direction from what's happening now.<br><br>Irving Berlin's song expressed the wish that the Creative Forces of the Universe <i>stand beside us, and guide us, through the Night with the Light from Above</i> (metaphorically speaking). Sarah Palin, currently getting a lot of attention in the corporate media, is a polarizing figure - but I can easily imagine someone her fans would find acceptable actually winning the next election. Mike Huckabee, in addition to being a former governor, like Ms. Palin, is a Baptist minister accustomed to appealing for guidance from above. I wonder if Mike Huckabee might be the one leading the torch-carrying crowd. <br><br>As Lawrence Berra said, it's hard to make predictions, especially about the future.<br><br><a href=#c9201733020526524251 title="comment permalink">11/25/09, 10:48 PM</a><br><br>

I've heard of it because the Canadian government has used it to pretend to do something about global warming.

So, energy intensity would be improve.

A decent chart of this can be found in here<br><br>http://www.investmenttools.com/futures/bdi_baltic_dry_index.htm<br><br> Obviously read this with some salt, given that this value is measured in US dollars and the value of those is not exactly written in stone.

That never happens ( even in the darkest of the Middle ages it wasn't like that ), so adding the ol' export/import ratings would help. A country, even with all of your G(something)P going well would still be going poor if most of the value ( note, value, not wealth )is being shipped out.

Due to the nature of things, it is far more easy to conclude " the data seems to point that A is true" than saying " the data says that A is true and B not ", especially when A and B are similar enough. When people are put in a situation where the data is not enough to discern between A and B, but it is enough to suggest that A is true if you had never thinked on B ( and this happens a lot ), the temptation of pretending that B never crossed your mind ( suposing that B actually crossed your mind, of course ) is high. Now look at most of the official statistics and see how much of them are testing two hypothesis compared with the ones that only test one ...<br><br>On productivity: the current number is pretty much a measurement of how much cash they can rip of a worker per hour, to put it bluntly. And in the end, what people really want at best is a efficient economy, not a productive one.

I'm usually largely in agreement with your views but in this case I must say I find it difficult to accept your recent comment (in response to my own),starting with this : "Dishonesty is a sign of weakness, not strength." While that may be true, those who bear the brunt of the consequences are much weaker than the perps of the fraud (as in pyramid, Ponzi, scheme on the largest scale in history). And the weakness of the "little people" will only become more apparent as present policies continue.<br><br>Further, you say that "It's because power is so diffuse and contested in our society that nobody tells the truth." <br><br>I believe, on the contrary, that power in our society has never been more concentrated, political/corporate/media/intelligence/military power strutting its stuff at a zenith of power projection unseen in post-WW2 history. Over 700 military bases in over 100 countries around the world. <br><br>As for the "contestation", you certainly are doing some but frankly I don't think your efforts are representative of the American people on the whole in that respect. Most belong to the sheeple category - some of whom may be brought around, granted, because many are merely ignorant, not stupid, but remain sheeple nonetheless.<br><br>Lying for profit when fraud is involved is criminal. White-collar crime goes unpunished. This is a point that I think should be taken on board as a sort of 'initial conditions' reference if, down the road, things are to become smoother as opposed to more vicious in our common transition towards another reality, something more closely approaching social equilibrium. <br><br>Of course one may ask: "Does the truth actually exist, anywhere?" And your warnings against scape-goating are worthy of heed ... up to a point. However, criticism of the massive financial, military, etc scam presently perpetrated on the population of our country does not qualify for a 'scape-goated' defense on the part of those who profit from it. Rather, the situation calls for actions which may involve the sort of political radicalization that we haven't seen for a good while. Wouldn't it be nice if such movements could be shaped without the ideological baggage.<br><br>I guess we both know that is, unfortunately, not very likely.<br><br><a href=#c69747419922732951 title="comment permalink">11/29/09, 1:46 PM</a><br><br>

The biggest one, as far as I'm concerned, is that it misses embodied energy: if Moneyland exchanges financial services for ipods with Makestuffland, its energy intensity is incredibly low - despite the fact that its demand for ipods must be considered at least 50% responsible for the energy used to make it. So it seems rather unfair to hold China responsible for its relatively inefficient energy intensity, given that it's mainly rich Westerners demanding its output.<br><br>Also: energy intensity ties to emissions intensity ties to the Kaya Identity, which is used in eg. IPCC to measure global co2 emissions.<br><br>I spoke to someone who'd just got back from Venezuela: it seemed a terribly poor place to them, and they wondered if it had got worse or better. This made me wonder: how do we choose to measure? The state generally has a monopoly on doing this (and, actually, more and more its large corporations via loyalty cards.) But it's worth remembering the example of Seebohm Rowntree:<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seebohm_Rowntree<br><br> - before he measured poverty in the UK (in my home town of York, in fact) it was accepted fact that the poor had only themselves to blame. He showed that wasn't true - a family could be working all the hours God sent, and still be in poverty. It's hard to get our heads round what a dramatic societal transformation this was. And, most interestingly, Rowntree and Booth were two researchers, out there by themselves. We're used to thinking of the idea of measurement as somehow synonymous with governments and surveys - it's worth remembering that it can also be a radical, grassroots tool for revealing hidden truths.<br><br>Difficult to do for a whole economy, though! p.s. thanks for taking the time to respond to everyone's commons, you're an uncommonly civil chap.<br><br><a href=#c2952179399621199593 title="comment permalink">11/30/09, 7:27 AM</a><br><br>

It reminds me, that just few years ago similar step has happened in the computer industry. <br><br>Several years ago, the performance of the computer processors had been measured in the number of operations performed per second (or in MHz, there was a linear dependency between the two at the time). Everything seemed to be o.k., but one day processors started to get close to their physical limits (a logical circuit requires minimum amount of silicon, there are only three dimensions in which the circuits can be connected...). As a result, the processor makers were forced to change the performance criterion and now it is (or is very similar to) the number of operations per input energy consumed by processor. The parallel is obvious. <br><br>I think, the Barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) as an unit of energy is unnecessary - there already is very useful unit: Joule (J).<br><br>It makes me smile, when I try to imagine barrel of oil priced in J (as a difference between energy that can be exploited and energy needed to exploit), potatoes priced in J (energy a human body can gain minus energy needed to grow them), or credit swap (number of J a man burns to sign the contract) :-D. Nevertheless, it is probably the only way to go.<br><br>I finally see in your essay some proposals (energy as price, GPP, GSP, GTP). I will forward your essay to my friend economist.
