It’s been a long road, but we’ve finally reached the point in these essays at which it’s possible to start talking about some of the consequences of the primary economic fact of our time, the arrival of geological limits to increasing fossil fuel production. That’s as challenging a topic to discuss as it will be to live through, because it cannot be understood effectively from within the presuppositions that structure most of today’s economic thinking.<br><br>It’s common, for example, to hear well-intentioned people insist that the market, as a matter of course, will respond to restricted fossil fuel production by channeling investment funds either in more effective means of producing fossil fuels, on the one hand, or new energy sources on the other. The logic seems impeccable at first glance: as the price of oil, for example, goes up, the profit to be made by bringing more oil or oil substitutes onto the market goes up as well; investors eager to maximize their profits will therefore pour money into ventures producing oil and oil substitutes, and production will rise accordingly until the price comes back down.<br><br>That’s the logic of the invisible hand, first made famous by Adam Smith in <i>The Wealth of Nations</i> more than two centuries ago, and still central to most mainstream ideas of market economics. That logic owes much of its influence to the fact that in many cases, markets do in fact behave this way. Like any rule governing complex systems, though, it is far from foolproof, and it needs to be balanced by an awareness of the places where it fails to work.<br><br>Energy is one of those places: in some ways, the most important of all. Energy is not simply one commodity among others; it is the ur-commodity, the foundation for all economic activity. It follows laws of its own – the laws of thermodynamics, notably – which are not the same as the laws of economics, and when the two sets of laws come into conflict, the laws of thermodynamics win every time.<br><br>Consider an agrarian civilization that runs on sunlight, as every human society did until the rise of industrialism some three centuries ago. In energetic terms, part of the annual influx of solar energy is collected via agriculture, stored in the form of grain, and transformed into mechanical energy by feeding the grain to human laborers and draft animals. It's an efficient and resilient system, and under suitable conditions it can deploy astonishing amounts of energy; the Great Pyramid is one of the more obvious pieces of evidence for this fact.<br><br>Such civilizations normally develop thriving market economies in which a wide range of goods and services are exchanged. They also normally develop intricate social abstractions that manage the distribution of these goods and services, as well as the primary wealth that comes through agriculture from the sun, among their citizens. Both these, however, depend on the continued energy flow from sun to fields to granaries to human and animal labor forces. If something interrupts this flow -- say, a failure of the harvest -- the only option that allows for collective survival is to have enough solar energy stored in the granaries to take up the slack.<br><br>This is necessary because energy doesn't follow the ordinary rules of economic exchange. Most other commodities still exist after they've been exchanged for something else, and this makes exchanges reversible; for example, if you sell gold to buy marble, you can normally turn around and sell marble to buy gold. The invisible hand works here; if marble is in short supply, those who have gold and want marble may have to offer more gold for their choice of building materials, but the marble quarries will be working overtime to balance things out.<br><br>Energy is different. Once you turn the energy content of a few million bushels of grain into a pyramid, say, by using the grain to feed workers who cut and haul the stones, that energy is gone, and you cannot turn the pyramid back into grain; all you can do is wait until the next harvest. If that harvest fails, and the stored energy in the granaries has already been turned into pyramids, neither the market economy of goods and services or the abstract system of distributing goods and services can make up for it. Nor, of course, can you send an extra ten thousand workers into the fields if you don't have the grain to keep them alive.<br><br>The peoples of agrarian civilizations generally understood this. It's part of the tragedy of the modern world that most people nowadays do not, even though our situation is not all that different from theirs. We're just as dependent on energy inputs from nature, though ours include vast quantities of prehistoric sunlight, in the form of fossil fuels, as well as current solar energy in various forms; we've built atop that foundation our own kind of markets to exchange goods and services; and our abstract system for managing the distribution of goods and services -- money -- is as heavily wrapped in mythology as anything in the archaic civilizations of the past.<br><br>The particular form taken by money in the modern world has certain effects, however, not found in ancient systems. In the old agrarian civilizations, wealth consisted primarily of farmland and its products. The amount of farmland in a kingdom might increase slightly through warfare or investment in canal systems, though it might equally decrease if a war went badly or canals got wrecked by sandstorms; everybody hoped when the seed grain went into the fields that the result would be a bumper crop, but no one imagined that the grain stockpiled in the granaries would somehow multiply itself over time. Nowadays, by contrast, it's assumed as a matter of course that money ought automatically to produce more money.<br><br>That habit of thought has its roots in the three centuries of explosive economic growth that followed the birth of the industrial age. In an expanding economy, the amount of money in circulation needs to expand fast enough to roughly match the expansion in the range of goods and services for sale; when this fails to occur, the shortfall drives up interest rates (the cost of using money) and can cause economic contractions. This was a serious and recurring problem in the late 19th century, and led the reformers of the Progressive era to reshape industrial economies in ways that permitted the money supply to expand over time to match the expectation of growth. Once again, the invisible hand was at work, with some help from legislators: a demand for more money eventually give rise to a system that produced more money.<br><br>It's been pointed out by a number of commentators in the peak oil blogosphere that the most popular method for expanding the money supply -- the transformation of borrowing at interest from an occasional bad habit of the imprudent to the foundation of modern economic life -- has outlived its usefulness once an expanding economy driven by increasing fossil fuel production gives way to a contracting economy limited by decreasing fossil fuel production. This is quite true in an abstract sense, but there's a trap in the way of putting that sensible realization into practice.<br><br>The arrival of geological limits to increasing fossil fuel production places a burden on the economy, because the cost in energy, labor, and materials (rather than money) to extract fossil fuels does not depend on market forces. On average, it goes up over time, as easily accessible reserves are depleted and have to be replaced by those more difficult and costly to extract. Improved efficiencies and new technologies can counter that to a limited extent, but both these face the familiar problem of diminishing returns as the laws of thermodynamics, and other physical laws, come into play.<br><br>As a society nears the geological limits to production, in other words, a steadily growing fraction of its total supply of energy, resources, and labor have to be devoted to the task of bringing in the energy that keeps the entire economy moving. This percentage may be small at first, but it's effectively a tax in kind on every productive economic activity, and as it grows it makes productive economic activity less profitable. The process by which money produces more money consumes next to no energy, by contrast, and so financial investments don't lose ground due to rising energy costs.<br><br>This makes financial investments, on average, relatively more profitable than investing in the kinds of economic activity that use energy to produce nonfinancial goods and services. The higher the burden imposed by energy costs, the more sweeping the disparity becomes; the result, of course, is that individuals trying to maximize their own economic gains move their money out of investments in the productive economy of goods and services, and into the paper economy of finance.<br><br>Ironically, this happens just as a perpetually expanding money supply driven by mass borrowing at interest has become an anachronism unsuited to the new economic reality of energy contraction. It also guarantees that any attempt to limit the financial sphere of the economy will face mass opposition, not only from financiers, but from millions of ordinary citizens whose dream of a comfortable retirement depends on the hope that financial investments will outperform the faltering economy of goods and services. Meanwhile, just as the economy most needs massive reinvestment in productive capacity to retool itself for the very different world defined by contracting energy supplies, investment money seeking higher returns flees the productive economy for the realm of abstract paper wealth.<br><br>Nor will this effect be countered, as suggested by the well-intentioned people mentioned toward the beginning of this essay, by a flood of investment money going into energy production and bringing the cost of energy back down. Producing energy takes energy, and thus is just as subject to rising energy costs as any other productive activity; even as the price of oil goes up, the costs of extracting it or making some substitute for it rise in tandem and make investments in oil production or replacement no more lucrative than any other part of the productive economy. Oil that has already been extracted from the ground may be a good investment, and financial paper speculating on the future price of oil will likely be an excellent one, but neither of these help increase the supply of oil, or any oil substitute, flowing into the economy.<br><br>One intriguing detail of this scenario is that it has already affected the first major oil producer to reach peak oil -- yes, that would be the United States. It's unlikely to be accidental that in the wake of its own 1972 production peak, the American economy has followed exactly this trajectory of massive disinvestment in the productive economy and massive expansion of the paper economy of finance. Plenty of other factors played a role in that process, no doubt, but I suspect that the unsteady but inexorable rise in energy costs over the last forty years or so may have had much more to do with the gutting of the American economy than most people suspect.<br><br>If this is correct, now that petroleum production has encountered the same limits globally that put it into a decline here in the United States, the same pattern of disinvestment in the production of goods and services coupled with metastatic expansion of the financial sector may show up on a much broader scale. There are limits to how far it can go, of course, not least because financiers and retirees alike are fond of consumer goods now and then, but those limits have not been reached yet, not by a long shot. It's all too easy to foresee a future in which industry, agriculture, and every other sector of the economy that produces goods and services suffer from chronic underinvestment, energy costs continue rising, and collapsing infrastructure becomes a dominant factor in daily life, while the Wall Street Journal (printed in Shanghai by then) announces the emergence of the first half dozen quadrillionaires in the derivatives-of-derivatives-of-derivatives market.<br><br>Perhaps the most important limit in the way of such a rush toward economic absurdity is the simple fact that not every economy uses the individual decisions of investors pursuing private gain to allocate investment capital. It may not be accidental that quite a few of the world's most successful economies just now, with China well in the lead, make their investment decisions based at least in part on political, military, and strategic grounds, while the nation that preens itself most proudly on its market economy -- yes, that would be the United States again -- is lurching from one economic debacle to another.<br><br>It is unfortunately also the case that many of the nations that have extracted their investment decisions from the hands of a self-terminating market system are not exactly noted for their delicate care for human rights. If that proves to be the wave of the future -- and it may be worth noting that Oswald Spengler, among others, predicted that outcome -- then the invisible hand may end up giving us all the finger.

However, when formulated as an equation of motion, the second law can be used to describe many other processes in energetic terms, such as natural selection for the fittest species, organization of cellular metabolism, or an ecosystem’s food web. In these systems, free energy is consumed; that is, energy is dispersed in a way to promote the maximal increase of entropy, which is the essence of the second law."<br><br>[...]<br><br>"As the scientists explain, it’s inherently impossible to predict future economic growth and decline in any detail from this perspective. The fundamental reason for this unpredictability is that the economy’s energy density is not constant, so that a player’s decision will affect future decisions that are open for other players. Physically speaking, the forces (free energy in resources) that drive the flows (economic activities) are in turn affected by the flows and so on. Moreover, each player tries to take into account how their decision will affect the decisions made by others. The result of these complex interactions based on subjective decision-making means that economies with highly effective mechanisms of energy dispersal, such as the stock exchange and the market of raw materials, may change very rapidly and unexpectedly.<br><br>" 'The second law encourages activities that consume free energy as soon as possible,' Annila said. 'Therefore, there is the quest to increase productivity and throughput and to find new sources of energy. Moreover, the second law reveals that it is impossible to predict in detail the optimal course of energy utilization because the chosen course itself affects the choice for future actions. Therefore, it makes sense to favor statistically independent actions that open new opportunities to consume free energy, and likewise to regard the use of insider information as illegal since it narrows the choices.' "<br><br>I especially enjoyed, "free energy" and "economies with highly effective mechanisms of energy dispersal, such as the stock exchange and the market of raw materials". Not to mention this comment from a reader:<br><br>"On a personal note, I hate the Second Law. It really captures the most depressing possibilities in all of human awareness."<br><br>Personally, I think the comment thread for the article, "really captures the most depressing possibilities in all of human awareness".<br><br><a href=gesture-from-invisible-hand.html#c3108890694652946463 title="comment permalink">11/12/09, 2:36 AM</a><br><br>

What interests me is that Rome follows the US pattern, even without a fossil fuel boom. In fact Spengler saw that as well -- money thinning out, away from ground-level reality. Does production automatically become more expensive in some generalized way? Or are we talking about empire, also, as a kind of diminishing return? Or is it a case of the general tendency of a culture to disappear into its own ideas-set?<br><br>All of these I suppose. It's very nice that Elinor Ostrom provided a local level alternative both to the command and to the game-theory kinds of market economics, a realistic one it does seem. If only this could be scaled up... this post suggests a firmer democratic hand than currently holds the US wheel would be likelier to prevent a firm *non*-democratic hand later.

NO computers. And maybe also add no TV for one week. No computers and no TV for one week. I will have to do this during December or January as an experiment. See what happens. Perhaps the week of Christmas, maybe the first week of January.

But also to see if my thinking processes change...see how the electronic world messes with our minds. One week may not be enough, but it will be interesting. Anyone else up for the challenge? No email, no TV, no video games, no cell phone, no ebooks, etc. for 1 week. How have our minds been affected? Could YOU do it?<br><br>It is very interesting. I of course grew up with TV since infancy, but the rest only came as an adult, over the last 10-15 years. I have been without such things a couple of times over the last 10-15 years, but never longer than a day or two. Never anything close to a week. But I noticed even after only 1-2 days my mind felt different. Like being a sugar addict, and being denied sugar. It drives you nuts for about 3 days. Then you start calming down and things appear differently...<br><br>So far I have gotten a few responses and all were negative. Some were jocular (what? give up my game for a WEEK? haha, no way).

I should probably say also that I find no merit in the notion that humanity ought to metastasize through outer space, even if we had the energy resources to do so, which we don't. Instead of fantasizing about other planets, let's learn to live on this one, shall we? <br><br>Phrique, thanks for the link. I'm not at all sure I agree with their take on the thermodynamics of the economy, though. <br><br>Jason, this is where Tainter's concept of diminishing returns becomes so crucial. All complex systems run into diminishing returns as their basic strategies exhaust the easy pickings. Those societies that survive are the ones that figure out how to ramp down expansion and move toward the deliberate pursuit of stability instead. More on this later. <br><br>Rufus, sure, and maybe the Tooth Fairy will turn all our fillings into plutonium some day. Sheesh. <br><br>DIYer, heh. Exactly. <br><br>Matt, actually, inflation is one of the two ways that the innate expansion of the money supply, caused by interest, gets brought back into balance with the limited supply of goods and services. The other way is bankruptcies, defaults on loans, etc.; when you suppress inflation, you guarantee a higher rate of these latter. Take your pick. <br><br>Llewellyn, thank you.<br><br>Kevin, no argument there. Pull any random paragraph out of Macdonald or Tolkien (who was a major Macdonald fan, BTW), and you're guaranteed more insight than I think you'll find in the entire modern profession of economics. <br><br>Phil, thanks for the link. One of the things I'm trying to do here is to point out the places where the mechanisms our society uses to guide itself are leading us over a cliff; some of the new ecological economists are doing the same thing, and more power to 'em. <br><br>Keith, good question. I think so; there have been economists (Schumacher and Galbraith come to mind) who combined a solid grasp of economic reality with a great deal of wisdom, and Schumacher was himself a mystic of sorts. BTW, the Adyashanti quote is great -- it's exactly when we stop insisting that the rest of the world is obliged to play the roles we assign it in our self-scripted melodramas that we start moving toward what's real. <br><br>Bill, square on target! As Bernard Gross pointed out decades ago, economic indicators have been turned into "economic vindicators" designed to flatter the status quo. The US economy is a shambles; it's been measurably in decline now for decades; it produces very little other than IOUs, and even those are starting to lose their appeal; and yet the numbers keep expanding. It'll bust eventually, but it will take a political or environmental event to pop the bubble of delusion. <br><br>Lance, I get the same responses when I mention to people that I haven't owned a TV in my adult life. Electronic media are among the most important drugs people use nowadays to silence their fears and their recognition of this society's widening failure.<br><br><a href=gesture-from-invisible-hand.html#c4146274326556094492 title="comment permalink">11/12/09, 9:29 AM</a><br><br>

In other words, become one of those Wall Street quadrillionaires, and invest the bulk of your earnings into things like farmland, livestock, and factories that produce animal-powered agricultural tools.<br><br>Is this correct? My own inclination has been to steer far clear of paper finance altogether for fear of crashes, and to focus only on low-tech production. Predictably, this has made me cash poor and resource rich.

Highly concentrated energy in this particular corner of the cosmos, in forms that we can use, is very, very finite, and we're running out. I wish people would take the time to learn a little thermodynamics!<br><br>Bastronaut, I've discussed the whole issue of renewables and net energy dozens of times on this blog, and don't really have time to rehash the issue now. Let's just say that I don't share your techno-optimism. As for metastasis being better than stasis, I doubt you'd be happy if the cells in your body agreed with you.

A lot of people will try to flee the real world via various kinds of escape hatches, online unreality among them.

Interestingly enough for the past few years I have been involved with a number of people in my country Mauritius trying to figure out how our own democratic institutions might fare past peak oil.

Instead of fantasizing about other planets, let's learn to live on this one, shall we?"<br><br>Mr Greer - I agree with most everything that you wrote, but the problem in my opinion is that nearly everything these days is being reduced down to economics and money, i.e. base hypermaterialism has hijacked our culture and this is leading to the atrophy of our higher human impulses.<br><br>Peoples, cultures, and nations need higher ideals and lofty things to strive toward. According to Spengler, The West is 'Faustian,' and as we have given up that striving Faustian spirit in favor of materialism we are clearly in decline. This may be the result of natural historical forces per Spengler's ideas, or it may be because we have temporarily lost our way.<br><br>They just found that significant amounts of water exists on the Moon, surely enough to support one or more human colonies. I do not misanthropically view humanity as a metastatic cancer, and thus I want to see us expand beyond this earthly cocoon...for what good is a butterfly if it stays forever cooped up and never emerges from its cocoon? And that's what my suggestion was about -- we humans, despite all of our advancements as a species, haven't even left our cocoon yet. Thus there is no reason why we should all retreat back down in to the primordial muck from whence we crawled just because we have become partially prostrate due to the 'social construct' of money.<br><br>From the Moon the next step would be colonies on Mars, and then one or more moons of Jupiter, Saturn, and hopefully beyond. In terms of energy, spaceships powered by nuclear reactors could take us that far, but it will take awhile to perfect that technology. Colonizing the Moon would still be a great first leap out of Mother Earth's nest and most of all would get people looking up again in to the Great Infinite instead of down in to their increasingly empty wallets. It would help to raise morale and imbue people with a sense of hope again, qualities which are sorely lacking in the modern hypermaterialistic West.<br><br>I agree that we have a lot of (re)learning to do about how to better live cleanly and sustainably on this planet, and your book THE ECOTECHNIC FUTURE is a step in the right direction, seeking to combine some forms of high-technology with more ecologically-friendly living patterns. Once we can master this, shall Western humanity be content to remain 'on the farm' forever so to speak despite our amazing advancements made thus far?

Also, the anarchic situation which currently reigns in terms of the 'free market' surely needs to be scrapped in favor of systems which are much more organized, especially locally/regionally. People also need to be made to feel more secure in their local living spaces, which means a rather large overhaul of local/regional planning and the like. That's about it. Economists and other dyed-in-the-wool materialists can argue about the specifics until the cows come home, and they probably will, but that doesn't change the aforementioned facts.<br><br><a href=gesture-from-invisible-hand.html#c7451902437876989320 title="comment permalink">11/13/09, 11:18 PM</a><br><br>

Can we think of a fairer way? <br><br>The fact is that people simply will NOT reduce their consumption until market signals, such as escalating energy prices, tell them that buying cars for their teens, living 50 miles from work, spending $80 a week in restaurants, and using the clothes dryer to dry two towels and a pair of socks, are not appropriate survival behaviors. <br><br>If decisions concerning concerning settlement patterns and transportation had been left to market forces, we might not now be saddled with the huge suburban buildout we have now, or worse, the growth of huge cities in the most water-short areas of the country. <br><br>But our government in its great knowledge and foresight chose to direct a major portion of our taxes to encouraging auto use and ownership, and suburban development, from about 1920 forward. Our cities were given over to the auto very early on, about that time. In St. Louis, as of 1924, you could not build an apt bldg with more than 18 units without providing off-street parking. Then, in the 30s, Roosevelt, great of heart but limited in knowledge and with no idea of how such a program would play out over decades, decided that the best thing we could do is encourage people to move out of overcrowded city nabes to auto suburbs, and there was, even before WW2, a fairly massive movement of middle-class whites to the old railroad suburbs just past the city limits. After the war, the stream became a flood as the FHA "redlined" perfectly intact city nabes while offering low-down-payment loans for newly built suburban cottages, and the interstate highways pretty much became the tombstones of the cities. <br><br>Meanwhile, the Bureau of Reclamation was building the fantastic plumbing system on the Colorado River, to make life possible in one of the most arid regions in the world, and to trigger the mass movement of millions of people from the moist, fertile Midwest and Northeast to a places that couldn't support more than relative handfuls of people without the water supplied by BuRec's 600' and 700' mega-dams.<br><br>Well, and those dams have now become a maintenance nightmare requiring massive energy imputs, and at the expense of areas of the country much more hospitable to life. One is literally about to fall down. What will happen when we no longer have the fuels to maintain these structures, as well as provide gold-plated highway maintenance on the interstates, at the expense of non-car owners like myself.<br><br>Unwinding our energy dependence and restructuring this country is going to be a much more daunting task- if it is even doable at all-because of the massive government programs enacted over the past 90 years that skewed markets in favor of suburban development and habitation in some of the most hostile climates on Earth, and these developments could not have taken place without the ham fist of government force. People could not have afforded them otherwise, and would have had to make their choices within their means. <br><br>And I have no doubt that, left to work strictly within their means, people would not have moved to distant suburbs en masse, let alone desert towns with no reliable water supply.<br><br><a href=gesture-from-invisible-hand.html#c4008193196474638203 title="comment permalink">11/14/09, 5:10 AM</a><br><br>

We currently use about a third of the world's resources and industrial production, and making do on local resources will require us to get by on a small fraction of that. <br><br>Karim, I wouldn't worry too much about the rich. Most of them have even less of a clue than the average American, which is saying something, and as the economy comes unglued and takes away the basis for their power, they'll be the last to figure out what happened. <br><br>Theo, the earth isn't a cocoon. It's the whole of which we are a part. The notion that we ought to abandon it for space is like claiming that a plant ought to gain its freedom by pulling itself up by the roots. Similarly, we haven't solved the problem of production; we simply postponed it for a brief time by stealing the earth's carbon reserves and burning through them for a three-century joyride. <br><br>You're right that we need a higher sense of purpose than that provided by economics, of course, but the delusion of space migration is just another form of the same thing -- the same fixation on more power, more resources, and all. That's the sort of thinking that's landed us in our present predicament. Like Faust, western civilization sold its soul for a few years of limitless power -- and now time's running out, and Mephistopheles is showing up on schedule to drag Faust down to damnation. <br><br>North Coast, free markets don't exist. What you're asking is whether a market controlled by the rich is fairer than a market controlled by the government. My suggestion is that either extreme is a bad idea. <br><br>Danby, exactly!<br><br>Glenn, one of the problems with conversations on the internet is that the same inaccurate factoids keep on being trotted out endlessly. You claim, like so many other people, that the Fertile Crescent is a barren wasteland due to agriculture. Have you looked up the current state of agriculture in, say, Syria and Iraq, where grain has been grown as long as anywhere on earth? (Hint: Syria is a major grain exporter today, and Iraq was until the first Gulf War limited its access to markets.) It's always possible to point to a few awful examples and a few inaccurate generalizations, and jump from that to the claim that agriculture per se is doomed to failure, but a more thorough consideration of the facts shows that such claims simply aren't true. <br><br>Of course current petroleum-fueled agribusiness has no future, and a good many other dimensions of today's agriculture will have to change radically as we move further down the far side of Hubbert's peak. That leaves a great many agrarian options. As for the middle ground between "free market anarchy and totalitarian planning," er, this is exactly the point I've been trying to make for the last three weeks.

The problem isn't entirely that the energy has been captured in a brick and mortar establishment (although that's part of it. There are too many moving parts in the equation, including population, for "frozen asset" to be the end point of what is essentially a dyamic energy exchange). <br><br>This very topic came up in a discussion of E=mc^2.<br>Take away mass (set it to 0) and you don't getE=light. It's a product equation. Take away mass, that leaves 0*light = you get nothing. The light went on for me as far as describing that we are spiritual beings having an earthly experience. <br>You free up the value of either to keep the equation moving, i.e., higher returns.<br><br>Thermodynamics turns our attention towards currents and currency. In our example of energy going into brick and mortar buildings, we have to examine the value assigned to the pyramid, which is relatively arbitrary if you think about it. <br><br>Economy has come to mean short term greed. Thermodynamics in the sense that it's being used here speaks more to the correction (dynamic equilibrium) in the process of relational valuing (which is oscillative and approximating in nature).<br><br>That we keep going from bubble to bubble in the US economy seems like a function of a populace studying one variable in the equation at a time, using a short term illusory pro-fit model. What we're learning is that what we've been defining as pro-fit economically isn't pro-fitting for human beings to operate dynamically moving, sustainable, interdependent niches. <br><br>So far, Big Finance, Energy, Pharma &amp; Insurance (for starters) have all developed compartmentalized models that maximize their profits as though they were silos. We've had bubbles in dotComs, auto, and finance/housing. Health Ins &amp; many medicines are overpriced compared to any other industrial country. Market models were detached from shared currency (grok fully all meaning of current) by way of overvaluing or in the case of autos, estimating greater turnover in purchase frequency (or failure to develop fuel economy). As you noted, energy pricing impacts influenced decisions by venture capitalists and consumers alike. To wit, the WSJ article on PeakOil pricing models, traditional tycoon vs. new (who ultimately won out) driven by short term profiteering. <br><br>So what do we do now? Focus less on money and more on currency. To paraphrase one of your recent interviews, we probably will need to develop a barter economy and that economy will have to be dynamic enough to interface with the restructure/retool economy (which will also retrain, which would have been a wise investment in the first place, but i digress). These are currency corrections a la 2ndL TD.<br><br>As for pyramids, they may be (physically) transformed by a pissed off invisible hand of Mother Nature, but right now we are seeing the *value* transformed. Think molecules flowing back into houses as some of the air is let out of the over-inflated unit. The social arrangements will change as well. Probably more molecules than before will move into the pyramid. Collectively speaking, there may be some increase in the flow of nomadic, cross-pollinating traveling while others may cohere in intentional community.<br><br>Yes the physicality of the pyramid transforms more slowly. The value of the pyramid is transformed through flow of currents &amp; currency.<br><br><a href=gesture-from-invisible-hand.html#c207354281987614647 title="comment permalink">11/14/09, 10:33 PM</a><br><br>

The phrase appears once in the “Wealth of Nations”, in the chapter on mercantile political economy. He uses the metaphor in a simple argument that by cautiously preferring domestic markets over oversees, merchants un-deliberatively support domestic industry. This quote became profound and “central” only from the 1950s:<br><br><i>He <b>generally</b>, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as <b>in many other cases</b>, led by an <b>invisible hand</b> to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was not part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by <b>those</b> who affected to trade for the public good. It is an affectation, indeed, <b>not very common</b> among merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it.<br></i><br><br>If Adam Smith were blogging today, he would be complaining that he did not mean that this invisible hand works in <b>all cases</b>.

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c2138945534838259080></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/12944650651876209511 rel=nofollow>das monde</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>JMG, your observations about impact of money supply on economic growth (or futility of modern investment games) are good. But the emphasis on <i>“borrowing money at interest”</i> betrays an important misconception. The interest rate <b>never</b> creates any money - it does something opposite. Say, if a credit card company puts up an egregious interest rate for you, that by itself does not create any money whatsoever - it only compels you to come up with more money by whatever means you are able to. You might succeed in fishing up enough money to cover the interest rate - but that only means that many others will be much less lucky. What actually creates money is the so-called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_doYllBk5No" rel=nofollow>“bank loan”</a> (forget the interest rate). <i>“Borrowing money”</i> from a bank is a misnomer: the bank does not take away money from its deposits and optimistically hands to you. It rather makes a promise that the “borrowed money” (made up just of thin air and your signature) will always be available to you (or to the seller of your new home or car). If it looks too crazy when you think about it, the craziness is the point of all modern economic marasmus.<br><br>In particular, don’t hold your breath for imminent inflation out of “huge government spending” or whatsoever. The key problem is that money is getting desperately locked out out of productive economy. The growing difference between financial wealth claimers and indebted producers is becoming a chasm of historical proportions. Paper money may indeed be loosing value in the stratosphere of financial “investments”. But down on Earth, money as legitimator of any economic activity is gravely lacking. Keynessians know <a href=http://www.eurotrib.com/story/2009/11/16/54725/912 rel=nofollow>an important point</a>. Even Obama’s trillions are not enough, especially if they are “naively” pumped into the unforgiving stratosphere rather than where they are needed.<br><br>The <i>banking people with resources</i> might be doing quite a good job in “relieving” the productive economy of monetary growth, along with compelling lessers to gamble, or coming up with adequate rhetoric to justify the economically catastrophic course.<br><br>Which brings us to a historical perspective. It is often amusing to see projections of modern economic living back to the Middle ages, Rome and even the stone age of “The Flinstones”. But before Adam Smith and Charles Darwin, there was so much less subjective awareness of the economic struggle we <i>have</i> to endure. Even if trade and commerce were indeed slowly evolving from the ancient times, most of either the aristocracy or the peasantry could live comfortably ignorant of its secrets. The <i>invisible hands</i> that lead to invisible finger salutes so fast have little objective relevance either, in the long term history or evolution. <br><br>What really changed with the industrial evolution and global trade is the wealth and power balance between aristocracy, fresh industrial bourgeoisie (for a lack of better description) and the peasant and labour classes. The merchants and manufacturers did not have comparable social power ever before. That shift in the power balance was initially accommodated rather differently throughout Europe, America and the rest of the world. The British monarchy was smart enough to side with the new bourgeoisie, while the French monarchy was clueless, etc. <a href=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China_Business/KK13Cb02.html rel=nofollow>Read it here</a> for a bit more. What is happening now is perhaps the last stage of this runaway development. It is probably no accident that a fated social-economic or political singularity is approaching right when “we” are meeting limits of planetary resources.<br><br><a href=gesture-from-invisible-hand.html#c2138945534838259080 title="comment permalink">11/16/09, 3:34 AM</a><br><br>

I think A. Smith, were he alive today, might be flipping us off for more than one reason. He was essentially a moral philosopher. That was his intellectual upbringing, as it were. He believed in putting savings aside. Anathema to the 'shop till you drop' consumerism of today (or was that yesterday?). He lived in a period one generation after set-up of the modern central bank (the Bank of England) and pretty close to the modernization of the insurance industry (actuarial tables, interestingly also originated in Scotland with the Ministers' widows' fund).<br><br>The point being that 'saved' capital still has to go somewhere. Some may still put it under their mattress but you see what I mean. How much 'future safety' can people actually buy? This apparently simple question is fraught with anguish in our time and will no doubt continue to bedevil those lucky enough to have 'savings' for some time to come. For the rest of us, the question is already elsewhere but the 'answer' is not yet clearly delineated.<br><br><a href=gesture-from-invisible-hand.html#c2766903637987025366 title="comment permalink">11/16/09, 2:08 PM</a><br><br>

The issue I think very few people have grasped just now is that in a contracting economy -- by which I don't mean one with a contracting money supply, as in a recession or depression, but one in which the production of goods and services is steadily decreasing over time -- all investments, on average, lose money, and all wealth becomes worth less over time.

Your recent blogs have made me revisit Tainter: "Here is the reason why proposals for economic undevelopment, for living in balance on a small planet, will not work.Given the close link between economic and military power, unilateral economic deceleration would be equivalent to,and as foolhardy as, unilateral disarmament. We simply do not have the option to return to a lower economic level,at least not a rational option. Peer polity competition drive increased complexity and resource consumption regardless of costs, human or ecological." He then goes on to say, as you have aptly pointed out, "Both the primary and secondary world powers have sufficient economic strength to finance diminishing returns well int the future." Do they? He concludes the paragraph with this parenthetical thought " ...(This fact, however, is no reason for complacency. Modern evolutionary processes, as is well known, occur at a faster rate than those of the past.)." What on EARTH is a "rational option" then?<br>It would appear that on a personal level if you agree that one is primarily responsible for the consequences of their actions then some form of "undevelopment"is a necessity. We have to be bound by our photosynthetic allotment? Are we not going there despite our clever mental constructs and abstractions?<br><br><a href=gesture-from-invisible-hand.html#c5144241641292893071 title="comment permalink">11/18/09, 6:54 AM</a><br><br>

Still, given that the side effects of wasting energy include most of what counts as a current American lifestyle, I think it's wildly optimistic to expect an orderly transition of any kind -- especially when what we're transitioning to involves at least a 75% reduction in population. <br><br>Ana's Daughter, nah -- my experience is that when you talk about paralogical thinking, everybody thinks you're talking about someone other than them, and the more paralogical they're being, the more fixed the conviction. <br><br>Lance, it's getting to the point that the most profitable thing a political party can do is lose elections. They can sit on the sidelines, point fingers, and rake in big donations from outraged supporters. The Democrats spent the last eight years doing that; now it's the GOP's turn. I wonder how long it will take before both parties fight over who gets to lose? <br><br>Maw Kernewek, the problem with the space-colony-as-lifeboat notion is that the investment needed to create a self-sufficient colony on the Moon or Mars would bankrupt any modern nation. We don't have the money, the resources, or the time. As for other locations -- well, Iceland's not for sale, last I heard. I haven't read Rees' book, so I'll reserve judgment on the rest, but the title doesn't exactly encourage me. <br><br>Vic, if you're assuming that a rational option is one that will result in an appealing future, there are none. If a nation deindustrializes, it is overwhelmed by its enemies. If it does not, it crashes and burns with everyone else when the whole system comes unglued. Take your pick. <br><br>This is why I say we're facing a predicament rather than a problem; problems have solutions, while predicaments don't.<br><br><a href=gesture-from-invisible-hand.html#c3828759517898792324 title="comment permalink">11/18/09, 7:41 AM</a><br><br>

However, there is a danger in this because we are seeing a gradual movement in that direction in the United States, and if we are dismissive towards the word “fascist,” we may miss what is happening to our country.<br><br>Picture, if you would, a moving Venn diagram consisting of two circles: the nation and business, and imagine them slowly merging.
